The software lets us to log and transfer videos onto a hard drive, where it can be edited, processed, and output to a wide variety of formats. Final Cut Pro is so advanced that it is used by hobbyist filmmakers and industry professionals in TV, Film, and media. Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99. It’s evident that Final Cut Pro can’t be downloaded, installed, and thus used on Windows, which is unfortunate, but for Mac users, it’s a very powerful video editing software.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

                ></p>
<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-26.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-27.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-28.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-29.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>
<p>And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..</p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-1"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>

<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-26.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-27.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-28.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-29.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>
<p>And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..</p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-2"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>

                ></p>
<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-26.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-27.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-28.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-29.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>
<p>And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..</p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Color-Grading-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Color-Grading-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Color Grading in Final Cut Pro"></a>How to Color Grading in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Have you ever questioned the purpose of those odd video scopes or how to build super grades from the start in Final Cut Pro? In contrast to editing talents, color grading is a technical and difficult ability that takes practice.</p>
<p>In order to help, we decided to compile a thorough beginner’s article to color grading in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>With that said, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro"></a>1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Color grading may be a tedious and time-consuming operation, therefore it’s a skill set that calls for a lot of patience. Some editors won’t conduct any color grading or correction beyond the bare minimum. But even mundane-looking film may look remarkable if you know how to give it a dramatic touch.</p>
<p>A more cinematic grade requires a number of procedures, and there is no one method that works for all situations. We’ll therefore walk you through the process of creating a cinematic color grade in Final Cut Pro, but depending on your material, you might need to add or omit some phases.</p>
<h5 id="Step1Filming"><a href="#Step1Filming" class="headerlink" title="Step1Filming"></a>Step1Filming</h5><p>Since the raw video is essential for producing a cinematic image, an outstanding grade begins with the camera.</p>
<p>Use the greatest quality settings your camera offers while recording your video; the more information in your picture, the more you can manipulate it during grading.</p>
<p>While it may seem preferable to shoot with as much color as you can, using a duller color profile is very necessary. Your camera will have color settings, and although the washed-out, drab appearance may not inspire confidence in you, it will offer you a lot more editing possibility.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Create-a-color-profile"><a href="#Step2Create-a-color-profile" class="headerlink" title="Step2Create a color profile"></a>Step2Create a color profile</h5><p>After importing your film, you may be concerned about the general dull look of your recordings. The reason for that is because you have not yet matched the color profile of your sequence to the one of your camera. To start on this process, it goes as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag your clip onto your timeline and make sure it is selected. Click on the Inspector icon.</li>
<li>Then click on the Information tab of the clip.</li>
<li>Navigate all the way down through the options to find the Color LUT option.</li>
<li>Then choose the Color profile that matches your clip based on the camera it is filmed with.</li>
<li>You’re done!</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step3Checking-the-scopes"><a href="#Step3Checking-the-scopes" class="headerlink" title="Step3Checking the scopes"></a>Step3Checking the scopes</h5><p>The Scopes in Final Cut Pro are panels that display the color information of your shots. They are quite complicated and can be difficult to comprehend if you did not use them ever before. You can activate Video Scopes by clicking View &gt; Show in Viewer &gt; Video Scopes from the View menu. The three components of grading are the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. Your highlights are shown at the top and your shadows are at the bottom in all grading tools and scopes.</p>
<h2 id="2-Include-Color-Wheels"><a href="#2-Include-Color-Wheels" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Color Wheels"></a>2. Include Color Wheels</h2><p>Now that your setup is complete, you can begin grading your footage. Grading is done in multiple layers stacked on top of each other. It may take multiple levels to create the desired look. Follow the instructions below to modify your settings to match your clip if you want to give your footage a cinematic look.</p>
<p>You may access a wider range of color manipulation tools with the built-in color wheels, exposure adjustments, including isolation of color selection, RGB modifications across tone ranges, and simple masking.</p>
<h2 id="3-Color-board"><a href="#3-Color-board" class="headerlink" title="3. Color board"></a>3. Color board</h2><p>A vertical color spectrum is shown on the Color Board, and it is intersected by a horizontal line that features four nodes. These are the ranges of the footage that are designated as the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, respectively.</p>
<p>Adjusting a node to a new color space has an immediate and noticeable impact on the corresponding section of the image. If you move above the horizontal line, it will increase, and if you go below the line, it will decrease.</p>
<p>You also have control over the Saturation and Exposure settings. These are wonderful to have if you want to increase the contrast in your photographs and make particular colors more vivid or muted.</p>
<h2 id="4-Masks"><a href="#4-Masks" class="headerlink" title="4. Masks"></a>4. Masks</h2><p>Using the Shape Masks feature, each of these individual effects can be perfect for particular regions of your footage. In addition, by utilizing a Color Mask, you can alter the appearance of a specific color. It is possible to apply multiple iterations of each color adjustment to a clip and find it listed under the Effect heading.</p>
<p>The order can be changed by dragging and dropping, and either method can be disabled or enabled. Utilizing keyframes allows for the effects of color grading to be specifically timed as well. Last but not least, keep in mind that the quality and color sample depth of the clips determine how much of an overall adjustment you are capable of making to a color.</p>
<h2 id="5-Color-Curves"><a href="#5-Color-Curves" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Curves"></a>5. Color Curves</h2><p>If you are experienced with more advanced picture editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, you will benefit greatly from using color curves. Adjustments can be made independently to both the Luma (the brightest areas) and the primary composite colors (red, blue, and green).</p>
<h2 id="6-Match-Colors"><a href="#6-Match-Colors" class="headerlink" title="6. Match Colors"></a>6. Match Colors</h2><p>Match Color is an additional choice that may be made from the improvement’s menu. This function will try to replicate the visual style of one video clip in another. First, choose the clip whose color you want to change, click on that clip that has the desired appearance, and last, choose Match Color.</p>
<p>You will still be able to utilize these settings as shortcuts even after you have gained more experience with manual grading and are comfortable making finer adjustments manually. It is important to keep in mind that while using Final Cut Pro X for color grading, effects can be layered on top of one another.</p>
<p>It’s not likely that a single tool or adjustment will solve an issue or produce the desired result; rather, it’s more likely that a number of different impacts will be required. In the same way that different visual effects in Final Cut Pro X may be toggled on and off, any layers that you add to a clip can have their visibility controlled from the Inspector window.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In Final Cut Pro X, you may choose from a wide variety of grading plugins, ranging from more affordable solutions like FCPeffects to more expensive ones like Magic Bullet Looks, which are designed specifically for feature film-style grades.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a variety of stand-alone applications for color grading, such as DaVinci Resolve and FilmConvert. You might be comfortable with their gear, but you should also know that their professional-grade color package includes some rather complex editing options.</p>
<p>Beginning to experiment with all of Final Cut Pro X’s functions and determining which ones are most useful to you is the best method to gain an understanding of the program’s color grading capabilities. If you don’t currently have a project that requires your attention, you can download stock footage and experiment with it.</p>

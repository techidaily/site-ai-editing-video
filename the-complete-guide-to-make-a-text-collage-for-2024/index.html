Considering a few important ones will let you create an impressive collage in no time. Check out some useful tips and tricks to use text within the photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identify if you wish to add the text as the focal point or not. If you are using the text as the first striking thing in the collage then ensure that it is eye-catchy and interesting.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keep a good balance between the text and the images so that it does not look weird.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The color and the font of the text are among the most important factors to be considered. Make sure that both the text color as well as the font match and blend well with the theme and the images in the collage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keeping the background of the text simple, less detailed, and also clutter-free is important so that the text content comes out nicely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure only to add a few words or lines in your collage to make it look sophisticated. It’s majorly a photo collage with a dash of the text so keep it that way only and not vice-versa.</p>

<p>In the GIF Maker window, click on the “Import” icon to upload AVI files from your PC. On the right pane, select the start and stop times of the videos for GIF-making.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Cut the Part</strong></p>
<p>Separate that part of the video for which you want to create a GIF. From the “Range to Import option, select the default “Beginning to End” or “Selected Range”. You also have to check the box in the “Make Frame Animation” option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Check and Save</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>As you can see, the video will start running on your VLC media player screen. Now, select the video frame for getting the desired animation. Next, go to the “Video” menu and choose “Take Snapshop”. This step will save the video frame in the PNG format to the My Pictures folder.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Open MSPaint</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="open ms paint"
                ></p>
<p>You will have to open MSPaint on your PC. When it opens, click on the “File” menu and then open the snapshot that you had taken in the previous step. Again, click on “File” &gt; “Save As” &gt; “GIF” to download your GIF.</p>
<h3 id="03Convert-AVI-to-GIF-Using-Photoshop-3"><a href="#03Convert-AVI-to-GIF-Using-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="03Convert AVI to GIF Using Photoshop"></a>03Convert AVI to GIF Using Photoshop</h3><p>Converting <strong>AVI to GIF</strong> with photoshop can be a bit complex but you will get the highest quality GIFs in a short time. Read the steps here to start converting your AVI file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Import</strong></p>
<p>Run Adobe Photoshop on your PC or Mac. As the home interface will open, click on “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video Frames to Layers”. Now, import your AVI video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Cut the Part</strong></p>
<p>Separate that part of the video for which you want to create a GIF. From the “Range to Import option, select the default “Beginning to End” or “Selected Range”. You also have to check the box in the “Make Frame Animation” option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Check and Save</strong></p>
<p>Come back to the window and check the animation. Trim or add frames if it seems necessary or else simply go to the left side of the animation and click on check forever.</p>
<p>At last, open “File” &gt; “Save for Web”. Now from the “Preset” menu, choose from the GIF option or select from the drop-down list manually. Finish by clicking on “Save”.</p>

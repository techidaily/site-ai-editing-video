I’m editing my vlogs using my cellphone only, not until I found this Wondershare Filmora for Personal Computers. Not like any other video editor that you need to crack your brain understanding each and every feature, this video editor that I’m talking about on the other hand, made it simple and very handy to use.</p>

How I Decided to Start from Uploading the Video"></a>1. How I Decided to Start from Uploading the Video</h2><p>But before we move forward for more details about the video editor itself, let’s get back first five years ago. It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.</p>

<li>A teaser – wherein your aim is to caught the attention of your viewers.</li>
<li>An intro – what is your channel all about.</li>
<li>The body of the vlog – the part wherein you’re explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called <strong>“<strong>call of action</strong>“</strong> - wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you’re tackling. And last is the</li>
<li>Outro – closing session of your vlog.</li>

What Have I Encountered on the Way</h2><p>As the saying goes by, <strong>“<strong>The beginning is always the hardest part</strong>“</strong> and really it was. My YouTube journey was not as easy that even my friends didn’t recognize my endeavors. But still, I continue what I’m doing because I love it. It’s a hobby that at the same time, I’m learning something new on the process. And also, with the help of vlogging, I’m starting to gain my self-esteem that I forgot for many years back.</p>

<p>What Have I Encountered on the Way</p>
<p>It’s not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you’ve got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who’s going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who’s in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who’ll edit the video afterwards.</p>
<p>On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn’t mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it’s quality over quantity. You’ll have to think what kind of video you’ll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.</p>
<p>If you’re a new YouTuber, you don’t need to have high-end equipment’s for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his&#x2F;her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.</p>

What to Do As a YouTuber</h2><p>As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you’re passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you’re a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.</p>

<p>What to Do As a YouTuber</p>
<p>As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you’ll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you’ll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>It’s okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor’s timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, <strong>“<strong>dead air</strong>“</strong> or the part that you’re starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you’re doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.</p>

Below are some essential things to think about bringing perfection in slow-motion videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: A slow-motion video with visual appeal and a high resolution is crucial. This is especially vital if you intend to crop or zoom in on the video while editing.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you’re attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Editing:</strong> Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn’t slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.</li>

Below are some essential things to think about bringing perfection in slow-motion videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: A slow-motion video with visual appeal and a high resolution is crucial. This is especially vital if you intend to crop or zoom in on the video while editing.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you’re attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Editing:</strong> Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn’t slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.</li>
</ul>

<li>Drag the finished Time Lapse sequence to your Timeline after completing it as previously explained.</li>
<li>Over the Time Lapse, add the Performer Clip to the Timeline.</li>
<li>Choose Time&gt;Time Stretch by performing a right-click on the performer clip.</li>
<li>You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Step-5-Make-an-overlay"><a href="#Step-5-Make-an-overlay" class="headerlink" title="Step 5. Make an overlay"></a>Step 5. Make an overlay</h2><p>You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find Luma Key in the Effect Control Panel and drag it to your clip.</li>
<li>Change the Key Type setting in the Effect Control Panel to Key Out Brighter.</li>
<li>The Threshold, Tolerance, and Edge settings should be adjusted until only the silhouette is visible.</li>
<li>Use the Pen or Mask Tool to create a circle around the parts you want to delete if you discover any corners of your clip that are still visible.</li>
<li>Add any Effects, such as Light Leaks, to your Adjustment Layer by choosing “Right-click &gt; New &gt; Adjustment layer.”</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<p>After Effects CC must be opened, a new project must be created, the Import File menu option must be selected, and the appropriate folder containing the altered still images must be located and selected before the time-lapse photos can be turned into a film. You need to make sure that the JPEG Series box is checked, as well as the Force Alphabetical Order box.</p>
<p>Once you have clicked on the first image in the sequence. The time-lapse video that you uploaded appears in the project library. After performing a right-click on the filename, select “New Comp from Selection” from the context menu.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6-Exporting-your-video"><a href="#Step-6-Exporting-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 6. Exporting your video"></a>Step 6. Exporting your video</h2><p>After getting our sequence to perform some kind of slow, understated animation so that it appears as though the camera is moving dramatically, we will need to export a video file. Go to File &gt; Export &gt; Add to Render Queue, then open the Render Queue dialog box by going to Window &gt; Render Queue. From there, you can choose the Output Module and change the settings in the options dialog box. Finally, choose the Output To option and select the location on your computer where you would like to save the video clip that we are currently rendering and exporting.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>No matter how you make your time lapse videos, After Effects has a ton of features you can use to modify and enhance the way they look. Now that you are familiar with the fundamentals, you can play with the Frame Rates and Composition options. Check out this helpful manual for more information on Time Stretching and Remapping in After Effects.</p>

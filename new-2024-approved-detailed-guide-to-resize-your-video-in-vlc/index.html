There are millions of videos uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, and other video-sharing sites each day. Sharing your videos with others is possible when you know how to resize them in VLC. VLC is a free media player that allows you to convert or compress your videos in order to make them smaller for uploading or downloading.</p>
<p>Videos are a great way to showcase your business, company, or product on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But what happens when you use the wrong size for your video? The whole thing looks distorted and low quality. It’s not very appealing.</p>
<p>Luckily, resizing videos in VLC is simple. All you need is the right software and the right steps.</p>
<p>This blog post will walk you through how to resize videos using VLC. We’ll cover what the default settings are for video resolutions, how to change them, and why it’s important to know what size of video you’re uploading before uploading it.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let’s get started!</p>

As a result, we offer Fimora, an all-in-one video toolbox that can convert, compress, download, record, edit, burn, and more, as a better video compressor. You can change the video resolution, bit rate, encoder, format, and other settings to compress video and audio files in a variety of formats.

To resize videos, first make sure you have imported your video file into the editor.</p>
<p><strong>Resizing by changing the dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop the file on the screen or click on “Import Files” in the toolbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-7.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Once you’ve imported your video, select the video clips that you want to resize by clicking on them; then, resizing them is as simple as dragging their borders!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-8.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: You can also use the size fields at the bottom of the frame to change their dimensions.</p>
<p>Step 4: Keep in mind that changing one dimension of a video clip will affect both its width and height proportionally. For example, if you enlarge a 16:9 widescreen clip to 720p (from 480p), it will be double its original proportions (720x480).</p>
<p><strong>Resizing by shrinking video file size.</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop it onto the screen or use the toolbar’s “Import Files” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Open the video shrinker’s output window by clicking the “Export” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-10.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Format tab and keep the video in its original format as a result. Then, in the “Settings” panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by choosing a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. When it comes to video formats, you can choose among FLV, MP4, and other similar formats, which normally result in smaller files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-11.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: The shrunk file should be exported.</p>

To resize videos, first make sure you have imported your video file into the editor.</p>
<p><strong>Resizing by changing the dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop the file on the screen or click on “Import Files” in the toolbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-7.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Once you’ve imported your video, select the video clips that you want to resize by clicking on them; then, resizing them is as simple as dragging their borders!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-8.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: You can also use the size fields at the bottom of the frame to change their dimensions.</p>
<p>Step 4: Keep in mind that changing one dimension of a video clip will affect both its width and height proportionally. For example, if you enlarge a 16:9 widescreen clip to 720p (from 480p), it will be double its original proportions (720x480).</p>
<p><strong>Resizing by shrinking video file size.</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop it onto the screen or use the toolbar’s “Import Files” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Open the video shrinker’s output window by clicking the “Export” button.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Format tab and keep the video in its original format as a result. Then, in the “Settings” panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by choosing a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. When it comes to video formats, you can choose among FLV, MP4, and other similar formats, which normally result in smaller files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-11.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: The shrunk file should be exported.</p>

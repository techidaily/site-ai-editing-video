Using Look-Up Tables in video editing has several advantages that can make your editing process easier, which are discussed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Save Time on Color Grading</strong></p>
<p>LUTs offer a quick way to adjust the colors in your videos. Instead of manually tweaking each color parameter, you can apply a LUT with a few clicks. It saves time and lets you easily try different styles. Moreover, it makes the color grading process more convenient for beginners.</p>
<p><strong>Maintain Consistency</strong></p>
<p>Applying the same LUT to multiple clips ensures a consistent look throughout your video. It is constructive when you have different scenes or shots. Furthermore, you don’t need to edit each clip separately. Moreover, you can save time and effort by applying the same LUT to your project.</p>
<p><strong>Professional and Creative Looks</strong></p>
<p>LUTs are created by experts and provide a range of creative styles. They can imitate the look of different films, genres, or specific grading techniques. Additionally, using LUTs helps you achieve a particular mood or style. Furthermore, LUTs enhance your storytelling or align with your creative vision.</p>
<p><strong>Match Footage from Different Sources</strong></p>
<p>When working with footage from different cameras or lighting conditions, LUTs can help. They can help match the color and tone of the clips. Each camera may capture colors; lighting variations can affect the overall look. However, applying a LUT gives you a consistent result throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Preview and Communicate Ideas</strong></p>
<p>Another advantage is that LUTs offer real-time previews of the final look as you edit. Moreover, it helps you visualize the aesthetic and make informed creative decisions. Sharing LUTs with your team or collaborators communicates your creative ideas. Furthermore, it ensures everyone understands the desired look of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Streamline Workflow</strong></p>
<p>LUTs can be integrated into your editing software, allowing you to apply and modify them. They can be combined with other adjustments like exposure, contrast, and saturation. In addition to this, it streamlines your workflow, freeing up time to focus on other editing tasks.</p>

Press the Add button to insert a keyframe here and change the scale and position of the title at this point. Move it to the placement you want, right above the lens flare. Also, drag the slider for the Opacity parameter to zero at this point.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-12.jpg"
                      alt="drag the slider for opacity"
                ></p>
<p>Subsequently, move the play head to the point when the lens flare effect stop, which is around 2 seconds more. At this point, you have to add another keyframe and change the Opacity to 100.</p>
<p>Play the preview of the whole thing to see how the effect looks in completion.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Indeed, the strobe light effect in the title of movies or videos of different lengths can effectively create a heart-stopping moment on the screen. Moreover, it can work to incite a feeling of anticipation in viewers, especially with the right music beat in the backdrop.</p>
<p>Using Filmora will allow you to add the cinematic effect quickly and efficiently with simple, quick steps. Follow the phases mentioned in this post while trying out different variations before settling on your final shot choice.</p>

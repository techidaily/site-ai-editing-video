These features will give a better understanding of the tool and provide a guideline on how to utilize the best functions with ease:</p>
<h3 id="1-Interface"><a href="#1-Interface" class="headerlink" title="1. Interface"></a>1. Interface</h3><p>When understanding the interface of <strong>the LumaFusion app</strong> on iOS, many would think the application won’t provide extensive tools to work with. This video editor does not come with a bland user interface but provides some great functions and features on an interface that allows you to create professional-level videos.</p>
<p>With the option of adding titles, transitions, color grading, and effects, LumaFusion is a complete video editor that provides features that are not commonly observed in many desktop-based video editors. Regardless, it presents an efficient workspace that has managed all the functions properly in rows and different sections.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="2-Video’s-Layers"><a href="#2-Video’s-Layers" class="headerlink" title="2. Video’s Layers"></a>2. Video’s Layers</h3><p>Creating proper movies on your iOS device is not difficult with LumaFusion. With the option of including six layers of video in the timeline, a lot can be done with them for improvising different sequences and multiple effects. Its picture-in-picture presets, layered transitions, graphic equalizer, and the use of additional plugins allow you to create complete videos with proper control.</p>
<p>Talking about some renowned iOS video editors in the market, you will find <strong>LumaFusion</strong> a much better option. iMovie, the dedicated video editor for iOS devices, can only embed two layers of videos in the timeline. This clearly explains why LumaFusion is a much better option with its video layers.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video layers in lumafusion"
                ></p>
<h3 id="3-Powerful-Keyframe"><a href="#3-Powerful-Keyframe" class="headerlink" title="3. Powerful Keyframe"></a>3. Powerful Keyframe</h3><p>The keyframes function on LumaFusion is not challenging to work with on the video editor. You can ecstatically create animating effects with the help of the keyframe sounds within the application. These effects, once created, can be saved and used on other videos within the platform. To improve your effects on the mobile video editor, you can use the powerful keyframe feature of LumaFusion to create the best results.</p>
<p>With a small price to pay for the video editor, you can gain access to a diversity of keyframes that can help you design the perfect effects for your video.</p>

<h3 id="4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Export to Final Cut Pro"></a>4. Export to Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Another impressive and touching feature this video editor provides to its users is its integration with Final Cut Pro - a proficient desktop video editor offered on macOS. You can easily export your created video to Final Cut Pro as an FCPXML.zip file directly after paying a one-time price. Users who are having a rough time editing the file on LumaFusion can easily shift to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>This process has disadvantages, regardless of the extensive control and accessibility provided between the applications. If you seek to use Final Cut Pro after editing a video on the <strong>LumaFusion app</strong>, you will have to add all the assets on FCP when you shift the file onto the platform.</p>
<p>Also, you might have to include many effects such as LUTs, Chroma key, and other relevant features. With this effort, you can easily put your video from LumaFusion to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-LumaFusion-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-3-Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-LumaFusion-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of LumaFusion Video Editor"></a>Part 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of LumaFusion Video Editor</h2><p>Suppose you are considering using the <strong>LumaFusion video editor</strong> on your iOS device. In that case, there are a few advantages and disadvantages you must look into to understand more about the tool and get to an absolute decision:</p>

</ul>

<li>To access the complete library of music and clips, you will have to subscribe to their additional plans.</li>
<li>The tool is already available at a price tag, which is associated with more subscription plans, making it a devalued option.</li>
</ul>

Rename Linked Folders</h3><p>In the previous versions of LumaFusion, you could not rename the linked folders, or the platform incorrectly named them. With this update, you can now easily rename the linked folders by selecting and holding them within the interface.</p>

<h3 id="3-Powerful-Keyframe-1"><a href="#3-Powerful-Keyframe-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Powerful Keyframe"></a>3. Powerful Keyframe</h3><p>The keyframes function on LumaFusion is not challenging to work with on the video editor. You can ecstatically create animating effects with the help of the keyframe sounds within the application. These effects, once created, can be saved and used on other videos within the platform. To improve your effects on the mobile video editor, you can use the powerful keyframe feature of LumaFusion to create the best results.</p>
<p>With a small price to pay for the video editor, you can gain access to a diversity of keyframes that can help you design the perfect effects for your video.</p>

<h3 id="4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro-1"><a href="#4-Export-to-Final-Cut-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Export to Final Cut Pro"></a>4. Export to Final Cut Pro</h3><p>Another impressive and touching feature this video editor provides to its users is its integration with Final Cut Pro - a proficient desktop video editor offered on macOS. You can easily export your created video to Final Cut Pro as an FCPXML.zip file directly after paying a one-time price. Users who are having a rough time editing the file on LumaFusion can easily shift to Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>This process has disadvantages, regardless of the extensive control and accessibility provided between the applications. If you seek to use Final Cut Pro after editing a video on the <strong>LumaFusion app</strong>, you will have to add all the assets on FCP when you shift the file onto the platform.</p>
<p>Also, you might have to include many effects such as LUTs, Chroma key, and other relevant features. With this effort, you can easily put your video from LumaFusion to Final Cut Pro.</p>

Premiere Pro is the most frequently used tool for video editing with several features. As a user, you may not understand the operations of Premiere Pro software. Thus, to add LUTs through Premiere Pro, follow these easy steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Adobe Premiere Pro on your device. Make sure to add a video clip that needs editing in the timeline. After this, move into the “Color” workspace from the top of your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="open color workspace"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the bottom left, there is a project window. From there, you need to click the “New Item” tab and choose “Adjustment Layer.” Now adjust the settings of the video from the available panel. This includes “Width,” “Height,” “Timebase,” and “Pixel Aspect Ratio.” Click “OK.” after you are done with settings.</p>

                      alt="set adjustment layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Drag the adjustment layer into the timeline from the project window. Set the length of the adjustment layer similar to the video’s length. Select the adjustment layer, and click “Lumetri Color” from the right-hand panel. From the “Basic Correction” category, set “Input LUT” and click the “Browse” option from the drop-down menu. Choose your LUT pack from the folder and press “Open” to apply the LUTs to the video.</p>

There are many benefits to using LUTs. Also, there are drawbacks of LUTs that cannot be neglected. Let’s discuss both benefits and disadvantages:</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LUTs are fast and efficient in their color grading schemas. So they can enhance upscale color resolutions in a calculated way.</li>
<li>With maximum consistency, LUTs apply color grading across the frames in the video. Hence, this provides a consistent look to the video in unique colors.</li>
<li>Using LUTs, you can carry experiments on your video through filter presets. The presets are available in different colors and styles, and you can adjust them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lack of personalization in most LUT filter presets. Hence, you cannot customize the color and styles for desired looks.</li>
<li>Due to limited precision, LUTs can involve color inaccuracies in their process. This happens because LUTs follow discrete values rather than using continuous gradients.</li>
</ul>

Thus, to add LUTs through Premiere Pro, follow these easy steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Adobe Premiere Pro on your device. Make sure to add a video clip that needs editing in the timeline. After this, move into the “Color” workspace from the top of your screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the bottom left, there is a project window. From there, you need to click the “New Item” tab and choose “Adjustment Layer.” Now adjust the settings of the video from the available panel. This includes “Width,” “Height,” “Timebase,” and “Pixel Aspect Ratio.” Click “OK.” after you are done with settings.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Drag the adjustment layer into the timeline from the project window. Set the length of the adjustment layer similar to the video’s length. Select the adjustment layer, and click “Lumetri Color” from the right-hand panel. From the “Basic Correction” category, set “Input LUT” and click the “Browse” option from the drop-down menu. Choose your LUT pack from the folder and press “Open” to apply the LUTs to the video.</p>

There are many benefits to using LUTs. Also, there are drawbacks of LUTs that cannot be neglected. Let’s discuss both benefits and disadvantages:</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LUTs are fast and efficient in their color grading schemas. So they can enhance upscale color resolutions in a calculated way.</li>
<li>With maximum consistency, LUTs apply color grading across the frames in the video. Hence, this provides a consistent look to the video in unique colors.</li>
<li>Using LUTs, you can carry experiments on your video through filter presets. The presets are available in different colors and styles, and you can adjust them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lack of personalization in most LUT filter presets. Hence, you cannot customize the color and styles for desired looks.</li>
<li>Due to limited precision, LUTs can involve color inaccuracies in their process. This happens because LUTs follow discrete values rather than using continuous gradients.</li>
</ul>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>
<p>5. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>
<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p><strong>Can I screen record on my Mac?</strong></p>
<p>You can use QuickTime that comes pre-installed on Mac. However, for professional screen recording experience, you can use Filmora or Camtasia where you will get more recording options and tools for editing after recording.</p>
<p><strong>How do I screen record on my iPhone?</strong></p>
<p>You can use DU Recorder app or Record it! app to record your iPhone screen video. Besides, the latest version of iOS comes with an in-built screen recorder option that can record the screen comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>Which quality is best for screen recording?</strong></p>
<p>The best quality for screen recording should be the same resolution as the screen. This means if you have a 4K monitor, the screen recording will be best at 4K resolution. In today’s scenario, 1080p or full HD is the optimal quality for screen recording.</p>
<p><strong>What do most YouTubers use to record their screen?</strong></p>
<p>Most YouTubers use Filmora or OBS Studio to record their screen. OBS Studio is mostly used by those who livestream their screen or gameplay. Filmora is mostly used by those who emphasize heavily on editing their recorded screen video for better output.</p>
<p><strong>Does screen record ruin quality?</strong></p>
<p>Your screen record quality can get ruined only when you use a screen recorder that records at a lower resolution due to its inability as well as to reduce file size. When you record your screen with a proprietary screen recorder, it can record the screen at exactly the same resolution as that of your screen. Hence, the video quality and resolution will stay intact.</p>
<p><strong>What do gamers record their screens?</strong></p>
<p>Gamers prefer Bandicam, Camtasia as well as Filmora to record their screens and showcase their gameplay to the world. Bandicam allows recording 2D and 3D games from gaming consoles at 4K resolution.</p>

Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let’s dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:</p>
<h3 id="What-Does-It-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Does-It-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Look Like"></a>What Does It Look Like</h3><p>Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file’s title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.</p>

<h3 id="Timecode-Format"><a href="#Timecode-Format" class="headerlink" title="Timecode Format"></a>Timecode Format</h3><p>The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.</p>
<h3 id="Metadata"><a href="#Metadata" class="headerlink" title="Metadata"></a>Metadata</h3><p>A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline"><a href="#Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline" class="headerlink" title="Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)"></a>Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)</h3><p>Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.</p>
<h3 id="Advanced-Styling-Fonts"><a href="#Advanced-Styling-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Styling Fonts"></a>Advanced Styling Fonts</h3><p>Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.</p>
<h3 id="Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles"><a href="#Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles"></a>Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles</h3><p>Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.</p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer. Apart from differences in styling, time, and text formats, Web VTT files are incredibly easier to read and edit. You can also add comments which will remain hidden from the display.</p>

SRT and Web VTT files are mostly the same, with just a few distinguishable differences.</p>
<p>By understanding those differences between them, you can easily convert an SRT file to Web VTT or a Web VTT file to SRT. Here is how you can convert an SRT to VTT manually:</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step guidelines to Convert SRT to VTT Manually</strong></p>
<p><strong>Open in Notepad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to convert SRT files into VTT manually, search the SRT file in file explorer and open it in Notepad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit the File and save:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you open the file, you will see that all the text is quite close together with no black lines to separate sequences. If the file is small, putting blank lines in between would not be too difficult. However, it can be quite a time taking process if the file is large.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<li>To do it manually, you can add spaces between sequences.</li>
<li>Replace all the periods with commas. Press Crtl+H on your keyboard to open the replace toolbar and select replace all to replace all periods with commas.</li>
<li>The next step is adding WebVTT to the top of the file. You can also add a comment or title for the file right next to it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, remove 1 from the start of each time code. For example, if the time code is “100:00:11.580,” write “00:00:11.580”.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

</ul>
<p>If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Go to view</li>
<li>Click on the check box for “File name extensions”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="check file name extensions"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can easily change the extension from SRT to VVT.</p>

                      alt="hit yes and the extension will be changed"
                ></p>

<h2 id="Is-Web-VTT-the-Same-as-SRT-1"><a href="#Is-Web-VTT-the-Same-as-SRT-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?"></a>Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?</h2><p>While SRT is a popular text file used for captions, Web VTT is not far behind. Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let’s dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:</p>
<h3 id="What-Does-It-Look-Like-1"><a href="#What-Does-It-Look-Like-1" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Look Like"></a>What Does It Look Like</h3><p>Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file’s title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.</p>

<h3 id="Timecode-Format-1"><a href="#Timecode-Format-1" class="headerlink" title="Timecode Format"></a>Timecode Format</h3><p>The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.</p>
<h3 id="Metadata-1"><a href="#Metadata-1" class="headerlink" title="Metadata"></a>Metadata</h3><p>A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline-1"><a href="#Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline-1" class="headerlink" title="Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)"></a>Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)</h3><p>Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.</p>
<h3 id="Advanced-Styling-Fonts-1"><a href="#Advanced-Styling-Fonts-1" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Styling Fonts"></a>Advanced Styling Fonts</h3><p>Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.</p>
<h3 id="Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles-1"><a href="#Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles-1" class="headerlink" title="Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles"></a>Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles</h3><p>Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.</p>
<h3 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer. Apart from differences in styling, time, and text formats, Web VTT files are incredibly easier to read and edit. You can also add comments which will remain hidden from the display.</p>

<p><strong>Step-by-step guidelines to Convert SRT to VTT Manually</strong></p>
<p><strong>Open in Notepad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to convert SRT files into VTT manually, search the SRT file in file explorer and open it in Notepad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit the File and save:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you open the file, you will see that all the text is quite close together with no black lines to separate sequences. If the file is small, putting blank lines in between would not be too difficult. However, it can be quite a time taking process if the file is large.</li>
</ul>

<li>To do it manually, you can add spaces between sequences.</li>
<li>Replace all the periods with commas. Press Crtl+H on your keyboard to open the replace toolbar and select replace all to replace all periods with commas.</li>
<li>The next step is adding WebVTT to the top of the file. You can also add a comment or title for the file right next to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Masking video editing is the process of hiding or obscuring certain elements in a video clip. This can be done for aesthetic purposes and is often used to remove unwanted objects or blemishes from the footage. Masking can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-Masking-1"><a href="#What-is-Masking-1" class="headerlink" title="What is Masking?"></a>What is Masking?</h2><p>Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage. The mask is the portion of the video you’ve chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.</p>
<p>Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!</p>
<h3 id="Different-types-of-masking-1"><a href="#Different-types-of-masking-1" class="headerlink" title="Different types of masking"></a>Different types of masking</h3><p>There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>
<p>Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.</p>
<p>Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.</p>
<p>Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.</p>

<p>The Shape Mask is a simple mask that may be changed to editable control points in order to create complex bespoke masks (converting it into a Draw Mask).</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Final Cut Pro project and select the clip you wish to mask.<br>Note: You can’t composite a clip over another one while using isolated clips. Final Cut Pro has this option, which you may find in the Comping window.</li>
<li>To make a clip transparent, select it in the timeline and place the play head at a point within the video clip that shows the portion you wish to make transparent.</li>
<li>Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline (or press Command-5) to display the Effects browser.</li>
<li>Select the Shape Mask effect in the Effects Browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: Type “shape” in the Effects browser search bar to quickly locate the Shape Mask effect.</p>
<p>To apply the masking effect to the clip in the timeline, choose one of the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drag the effect to the timeline clip.</li>
<li>Double-click the effect thumbnail in the Effects browser to apply it.</li>
<li>Use the on-screen controls to modify the shape mask if necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The controls for the Shape Mask appear in the viewer, overlaid on top of the video image. In addition, the Effects area of the Video inspector displays the Shape Mask options. By default, the Shape Mask is set to a partially feathered ellipse shape in the center of the frame.</p>

<p>We picked the ‘Star’ form for this project. After selecting it, you may drag the shape to your clip in the preview area.</p>
<p>Scrolling down in the Windows category will take you to more options where you can change the scale, position, width, height, and radius of your chosen shape. You may also lessen the strength of the form and rotate it to make it blend in better with the other elements you’re trying to hide in your window.</p>
<p>To add the keyframe, simply hit the “Add” button after completing it. You may then modify the mask’s form to match the added frame.</p>

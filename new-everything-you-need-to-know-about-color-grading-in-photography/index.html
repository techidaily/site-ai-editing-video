<p>Have you recognized how flat your images look when you take them with your camera? While the scenery may be beautiful and your photography skills may be amazing, there’s always something missing. That “thing” is color grading, and that may be why your favorite superstar’s pictures appear better than yours. You can color grade your videos to produce the same effect too.</p>
<p>Color grading photography refers to a post-production process that improves your images by altering their color. The result of an excellent color grading process is an image that looks more appealing and refined. It’s what gives a picture some professional touch.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about color grading photography, this article will let you in on all you need to know. From essential color grading steps to terms, tools, etc., you can begin your journey to cool and exciting images after reading.</p>

Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that’s wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.</p>
<p>Here’s how to differentiate color grading from color correction:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Differentiating Factor</th>
<th>Color Grading ;</th>
<th>Color Correction</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>Color grading is a process that enhances an image’s color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.</td>
<td>Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers’ moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.</td>
<td>Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo’s look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage in the production process</td>
<td>Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That’s because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.</td>
<td>Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures.</td>
<td>Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.</td>

<h4 id="●-Hue"><a href="#●-Hue" class="headerlink" title="● Hue"></a>● Hue</h4><p>Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color’s position in the color wheel.</p>
<h4 id="●-Saturation"><a href="#●-Saturation" class="headerlink" title="● Saturation"></a>● Saturation</h4><p>When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.</p>

<h4 id="●-Luminance"><a href="#●-Luminance" class="headerlink" title="● Luminance"></a>● Luminance</h4><p>Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.</p>

Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that’s wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.</p>
<p>Here’s how to differentiate color grading from color correction:</p>

<tbody><tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>Color grading is a process that enhances an image’s color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.</td>
<td>Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers’ moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.</td>
<td>Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo’s look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage in the production process</td>
<td>Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That’s because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.</td>
<td>Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures.</td>
<td>Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.</td>

Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that’s wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.</p>
<p>Here’s how to differentiate color grading from color correction:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Differentiating Factor</th>
<th>Color Grading ;</th>
<th>Color Correction</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>Color grading is a process that enhances an image’s color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.</td>
<td>Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers’ moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.</td>
<td>Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo’s look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage in the production process</td>
<td>Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That’s because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.</td>
<td>Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures.</td>
<td>Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.</td>

<p><strong>Step 3: Sort the Imported Files</strong></p>
<p>Once you are done with importing all the media files, you can see them appear within the ‘File Queue’ at the left window of the slideshow creator program. Use the ‘Up&#x2F;Down’ arrow keys to sort the media files in your preferred order, for example, arranging them according to their specific file names. The file sorting options are available at the right side of the ‘File Queue’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Include Text Customizations</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Text Column’ of the ‘File Queue’ and tap the ‘Add Text’ button to include text annotations within each slide of your presentation. A ‘Text Panel’ will pop up, where you can choose to add color, position and font customizations to the included text, followed by previewing the effect on every slide within the ‘Text Panel’ itself.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add a Desired Background Music</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Icecream Slideshow maker pro</strong> allows you to include a background music track within your presentation. For working towards the inclusion process, you will have to import the desired audio files to the program’s editor timeline. The software works well with the WAV, WMA, FLAC, M4A, MP3 and OGG audio file formats. Navigate to and hit the ‘Add Audio’ button in the editor workspace to ‘Drag and Drop’ the desired music files within the software’s timeline.</p>
<p>There is an option to create a playlist of the selected audio tracks, along with dragging the files to set them in a preferred sequence within the playlist. You are also granted the liberty to try hands at looping the audio playback and uplift the tracks with fade and offset effects within the playlist pane.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Tweak Some Extra Settings</strong></p>
<p>If you are keen towards making your presentation more impressive, try experimenting with including transition effects within the slides. Though the <strong>Icecream slideshow maker full version</strong> supports the application of default random transitions, you are allowed to add and customize the same as per your will, both, separately for each slide, as well as to the entre presentation as a whole.</p>
<p>You can even choose to add no transition effect at all, or set the same transition value for all the media files within the queue, by navigating to and clicking on the ‘Common Image Settings in the ’File Queue’ window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Output Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Set a preferable output resolution to generate a premium quality slideshow presentation. To do this, navigate to the bottom left corner of the ‘Preview’ window at the right side of the editor workspace and choose a desired resolution for the slideshow from a range of values, such as, 1280 x 1024, 2560 x 1440, 1920 x 1080, etc., in the ‘Resolution’ tab.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> <strong>Format Selection</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is, select a convenient output file format for your presentation. You can pick anyone from the available AVI, WebM, MP4, MOV file formats. To make your choice, navigate to the bottom of the ‘File Queue’ window at the left and click on the ‘File Format’ dropdown arrow at the right. A list of the output formats supported by the program appears next, and you are free to pick the one you like.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Create Your Icecream Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>When you have finalized all the arrangements and settings, navigate to and hit the ‘Preview’ button at the bottom right corner of the ‘Preview’ window to initiate a mock run of your slideshow in the software’s inbuilt slideshow player. If everything seems fine, proceed to start the slideshow creation process by clicking on the ‘Create’ button.</p>

<p><strong>Renderforest vs PowToon</strong></p>
<p>One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It’s challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.</p>
<p>PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn’t provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.</p>
<p>PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.</p>
<p>Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.</p>
<p>Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.</p>
<p>Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.</p>

Key Features of Kdenlive</h2><p>If you need to edit videos occasionally, a free video editor is what you will be looking for.

<p>Proxy Editing – Kdenlive uses proxy editing technique to lower the resolution of high-resolution videos while you edit them.

Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos"></a>Part 4. Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos</h2><p>Kdenlive has several drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the best video editor. Even though the features are sufficient for beginners, it is not suitable for professional editing. There is a lack of advanced options such as motion tracking or faster video production. Besides, the effects are very limited in number and so are the text and audio effects. That is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to Kdenlive Mac and Windows.</p>

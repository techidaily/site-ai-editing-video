Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.</p>
<p>Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.</p>
<p>Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>custom slide show</strong> creation process with the finest details:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Tool</strong></p>
<p>Start the <strong>custom slide show PowerPoint</strong> creation process with launching the PowerPoint tool in any of your preferred devices. It would be better to work on a desktop or a PC. Proceed to open the presentation that you wish to create a custom slideshow from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Custom Slide Show Option</strong></p>
<p>In the welcome interface of PowerPoint, navigate to the ribbon at the top and hit the ‘Slide Show’ tab, followed by clicking on the ‘Custom Slide Show’ button from the ‘Options Panel’ that appears. As you tap the aforesaid button, a dropdown menu follows next, from where you need to choose the ‘Custom Shows…’ option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Custom Shows Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>The completion of Step 2 brings up the ‘Custom Shows’ dialog box, with a blank area at the left, indicating the absence of any custom slide show as yet. To create one, navigate to and click on the ‘New’ button at the right side within the dialog box.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Define Custom Show Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>As you tap the ‘New’ button, the ‘Define Custom Shows’ dialog box pops up with a display of the following fields and buttons:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slide Show Name Box</strong></p>
<p>Use this field to assign a name to your custom slideshow. In case you don’t add a name of your choice, PowerPoint will assign the name ‘Custom Show 1’ to your custom presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slides in Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Below the ‘Slide Show Name’ box, appears a list of slides in the chosen presentation which you can use to create the custom slide show. To add slides to the same, click on the respective slide names.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add Button</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Add’ button in the middle of the ‘Define Custom Show’ dialog box is used to include selected slides from the main list explained above to the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list at the right. The ‘Add’ button however, remains disabled until you make a selection from the main slides list to include within the custom slides list. Take note that you can choose to repeat the slides within the custom list.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Remove Button</strong></p>
<p>You can use this button to select and delete specific slides from the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list. The button however, remains disabled till you make a slide selection to be removed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slides in Custom Show</strong></p>
<p>This is a list of slides that you have selected from the main slides list to include in the custom slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Re-Order Buttons</strong></p>
<p>These are ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ arrows at the right side of the ‘Define Custom Show’ dialog box, which are active only if the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list has more than one slide to its credit. In such a case, you can use these arrows to change the sequence of appearance of the slides within the custom presentation.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Back to Custom Shows Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>When you have finished making all the required entries in the aforesaid fields, click on ‘OK’ to create your custom slideshow, which is visible in the ‘Custom Shows’ dialog box. You can preview the just created custom presentation by selecting the slideshow in the ‘Custom Shows’ list, followed by clicking on the ‘Show’ button at the bottom right of the dialog box.</p>

<p>A broad number of formats may be handled by QuickTime, including music, graphics, and panoramic photography. All of your music and video files will play without a hitch, and it is a fully complete media player.</p>
<p>Many customers buy a Mac computer and instantly install QuickTime, the default video player, under the notion that it is a basic video player with few additional functions. In fact, the QuickTime player has a slew of hidden functions that are pretty useful, but only a few people are aware of it. The option to increase the Quicktime player speed is one of these hidden features’ which is most popular and helpful.

</li>
<li><p>If you come across anything you like and want to view it again, you may stop the video by pressing the space bar twice. However, pressing the spacebar will cause the playing speed to be reset.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>
<h3 id="Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version"><a href="#Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version"></a>Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version</h3><p>The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>
<h3 id="Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not"><a href="#Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not"></a>Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not</h3><p>Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

<li>Launch QuickTime.</li>
<li>Click on Edit, which is located on the toolbar on the top. A drop-down menu will appear.</li>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>

For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-1"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-1" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>

For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-2"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-2" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>

For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-3"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-3" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Overlay-Video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Overlay-Video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro"></a>How to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro</h2><p>In order to make it simple to combine the shot’s components into a sequence, video overlays are pieces of film that are often recorded in a dark studio. Using image overlays on a video production is fairly frequent. However, adding pictures to every video you export might be tiresome and time-consuming if you have several films to send. For instance, an overlay video in Premiere Pro might be preferred by you rather than a manual addition of the overlay media.</p>
<p>There is a quick and easy method to know how to overlay a video on a video in Premiere Pro and we’ve got it covered. However, depending on the kind of element, there may be some color blending that affects the components themselves. Overlays may be filmed on either a green screen or a blue screen. Snow components photographed against a green screen may have a green hue shift, necessitating further color grading before the footage might be used.</p>

We’ll demonstrate how to overlay videos in this article. To liven up your intros, make your outros stand out, and spruce up your summer social media posts, add a gradient video overlay effect. Adobe Premiere Pro and gorgeous video clips are all you need.</p>

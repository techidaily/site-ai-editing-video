<p>Step 1: Import file:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-1.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Edit the FLV file:</strong></p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Acquire the perfect tool in your palm for anything you want to do, such as clipping, cropping, rotating, and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Furthermore, all editing capabilities in the toolbar allow drag-and-drop, making it even easier to touch up your films quickly. Consider the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop a transition into the video&#x2F;photo, or right-click it and select “Apply to All.”</li>
<li>Please drag &amp; drop a title template to the position where you want it to appear, then adjust it.</li>
<li>To use the effects, select one from the 50+ available video effects, select it, and apply it to your photos&#x2F;videos instantaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Save or Export the file:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities.

<p>Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:</p>

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

Adobe Premiere Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro:</strong></h3><p>Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It’s also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.</p>
<p>We found the software’s UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.</p>
<p>Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:</p>

Blender:"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Blender:</strong></h3><p>Under the GNU General Public License, Blender is a free, open-source 3D content production program that runs on all major operating systems. Blender is one of the greatest video editors for both Windows and Mac, with advanced features such as modifier-based modeling tools, powerful character animation capabilities, a node-based material, etc.</p>
<p>Because it is developed for professionals, it is tough to use as a beginner. However, it is unrestricted in its use and distribution. In addition, color options are changeable and versatile in the UI.</p>
<p> In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you’ll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the application.</p>

<h3 id="2-Final-Cut-Pro-1"><a href="#2-Final-Cut-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Final Cut Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Final Cut Pro:</strong></h3><p>When it comes to video editing software, Apple’s Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It’s a strong software with a lot of features.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Furthermore, all editing capabilities in the toolbar allow drag-and-drop, making it even easier to touch up your films quickly. Consider the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop a transition into the video&#x2F;photo, or right-click it and select “Apply to All.”</li>
<li>Please drag &amp; drop a title template to the position where you want it to appear, then adjust it.</li>
<li>To use the effects, select one from the 50+ available video effects, select it, and apply it to your photos&#x2F;videos instantaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Save or Export the file:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>

<p>Therefore, you can use the following steps to edit FLV video on Windows and Mac:</p>
<p>Step 1: Import file:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-1.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Edit the FLV file:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-2.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Acquire the perfect tool in your palm for anything you want to do, such as clipping, cropping, rotating, and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-3.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Furthermore, all editing capabilities in the toolbar allow drag-and-drop, making it even easier to touch up your films quickly. Consider the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop a transition into the video&#x2F;photo, or right-click it and select “Apply to All.”</li>
<li>Please drag &amp; drop a title template to the position where you want it to appear, then adjust it.</li>
<li>To use the effects, select one from the 50+ available video effects, select it, and apply it to your photos&#x2F;videos instantaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Save or Export the file:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-4.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>When you’re done, export your modified MP4 files to Windows&#x2F;Mac and quickly share them on YouTube, with the option of sending a message to Facebook and Twitter. When you click Create in the program window’s middle right corner, you’ll be taken to the Output window below.</p>

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

<h3 id="2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#2-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Adobe Premiere Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro:</strong></h3><p>Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It’s also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.</p>
<p>We found the software’s UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.</p>
<p>Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Import the video and create initial sequence.</p>

Blender:"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Blender:</strong></h3><p>Under the GNU General Public License, Blender is a free, open-source 3D content production program that runs on all major operating systems. Blender is one of the greatest video editors for both Windows and Mac, with advanced features such as modifier-based modeling tools, powerful character animation capabilities, a node-based material, etc.</p>
<p>Because it is developed for professionals, it is tough to use as a beginner. However, it is unrestricted in its use and distribution. In addition, color options are changeable and versatile in the UI.</p>
<p> In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you’ll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the application.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Import the video and start editing using the editing tools.</p>

<h3 id="2-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#2-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Final Cut Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Final Cut Pro:</strong></h3><p>When it comes to video editing software, Apple’s Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It’s a strong software with a lot of features.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:</p>
<p>Step 1: Create Project.</p>
<p>To make a movie in Final Cut Pro, you must first establish a project, which keeps track of your editing selections and the media you utilize.</p>

<p>Step 2: Select and add clips to the timeline:</p>
<p>The second stage in making a movie with Final Cut Pro is to add and arrange clips in your project. In the timeline, you can move and reorder clips.</p>

<p>The finest applications don’t force you to pick between “powerful” and “easy-to-use” instead of focusing on providing you with tools to help you accomplish your vision while being intuitive and simple to use.</p>

Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.</p>
<p>To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop icon. The software’s greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-2.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a New Project</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software’s welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora’s video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import Your Files</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-4.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organize Your Clips</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-5.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.</p>
<p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don’t belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-6.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>To evaluate the video clips you’ve uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply Visual Effects</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-7.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Export Your Final Output</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-8.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Hit the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p>
<p>Choose the type that better serves the project you’re working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p>
<p>Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you’ll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.</p>

<h3 id="How-to-Edit-MP4-Video-in-Filmora-1"><a href="#How-to-Edit-MP4-Video-in-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit MP4 Video in Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit MP4 Video in Filmora</strong></h3><p>You never know what you’ll want in the video editing room, and that is why you must equip yourself thoroughly for all of the obstacles that will arise during the video editing process. Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.</p>
<p>To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop icon. The software’s greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-2.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a New Project</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software’s welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora’s video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import Your Files</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-4.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organize Your Clips</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-5.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.</p>
<p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don’t belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-6.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>To evaluate the video clips you’ve uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply Visual Effects</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-7.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Export Your Final Output</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-8.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Hit the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p>
<p>Choose the type that better serves the project you’re working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p>
<p>Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you’ll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.</p>

<p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.</p>
<p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don’t belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.</p>
<p><img

<p>To evaluate the video clips you’ve uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply Visual Effects</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p>

<p>If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Export Your Final Output</strong></li>

                ></p>
<p>Hit the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p>
<p>Choose the type that better serves the project you’re working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p>
<p>Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you’ll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.</p>

<p>That said, if you simply need to make minor edits or aren’t planning on editing films for a long time, the most exemplary free video editing programs listed above can be handy.

Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.</p>
<p>To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop icon. The software’s greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p>

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a New Project</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software’s welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora’s video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import Your Files</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.</p>

<p>Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.</p>

<p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.</p>
<p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don’t belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Post a successful installation, proceed to launch the program and wait for the latter’s welcome screen to appear. In the launch screen, navigate to and tap any one of the ‘Add Photo’ or ‘Add Folder’ buttons at the top left corner to import either a single media file, or an entire media folder to the program’s editing workspace.</p>
<p>Instead of using the ‘Add Folder’ option at the top left, you can also select multiple files by pressing and holding the ‘Ctrl’ key son your system’s keyboard and import them to the editor timeline, all at once. You can alternatively, click on the ‘Add Files to Start Your Photostory’ tab in the center of the software’s welcome screen to import the required media files.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Tweak Some Extra Settings</strong></p>
<p>If you are keen towards making your presentation more impressive, try experimenting with including transition effects within the slides. Though the <strong>Icecream slideshow maker full version</strong> supports the application of default random transitions, you are allowed to add and customize the same as per your will, both, separately for each slide, as well as to the entre presentation as a whole.</p>
<p>You can even choose to add no transition effect at all, or set the same transition value for all the media files within the queue, by navigating to and clicking on the ‘Common Image Settings in the ’File Queue’ window.</p>

                      alt="Making an Icecream Slideshow With Music- Including Additional Tweaks"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Output Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Set a preferable output resolution to generate a premium quality slideshow presentation. To do this, navigate to the bottom left corner of the ‘Preview’ window at the right side of the editor workspace and choose a desired resolution for the slideshow from a range of values, such as, 1280 x 1024, 2560 x 1440, 1920 x 1080, etc., in the ‘Resolution’ tab.</p>

                      alt="Making an Icecream Slideshow With Music- Setting the Output Resolution"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> <strong>Format Selection</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is, select a convenient output file format for your presentation. You can pick anyone from the available AVI, WebM, MP4, MOV file formats. To make your choice, navigate to the bottom of the ‘File Queue’ window at the left and click on the ‘File Format’ dropdown arrow at the right. A list of the output formats supported by the program appears next, and you are free to pick the one you like.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Making an Icecream Slideshow With Music- Selecting the Output Format"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Create Your Icecream Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>When you have finalized all the arrangements and settings, navigate to and hit the ‘Preview’ button at the bottom right corner of the ‘Preview’ window to initiate a mock run of your slideshow in the software’s inbuilt slideshow player. If everything seems fine, proceed to start the slideshow creation process by clicking on the ‘Create’ button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Making an Icecream Slideshow With Music- Slideshow Creation Interface"
                ></p>
<p>The process may require you to wait for a few moments before the final presentation output is generated. Nonetheless, you can always keep a track of the creation process through the elapsed and remaining duration in the ‘Progress Bar’ at the bottom of the program’s editing workspace. A completion prompt will pop up as soon as the slideshow is ready.</p>

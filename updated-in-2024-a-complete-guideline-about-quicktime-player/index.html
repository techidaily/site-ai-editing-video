Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-1.jpg"
                      alt="select quicktime player"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Once the player is launched, you can simply select any video across the window that opens up. Once selected, tap “Open” to play it across QuickTime.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-2.jpg"
                      alt="tap on open button"
                ></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach. If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-3.jpg"
                      alt="choose your video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: In the “Open With” section across the menu, you will find the option of QuickTime Player. Tap on the option to open the video across QuickTime.</p>

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                      alt="choose video quality"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect?"></a>How to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect?</h2><p>No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.</p>
<p>All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="What Is Green Screen Technique?"></a>What Is Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.</p>
<p>Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Green Screen Technique?"></a>Why Use Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.</p>
<p>You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?"></a>How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?</h2><p>If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.</li>
<li>A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.</li>
<li>External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p>

We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing.

<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Making videos with DIY green screen stand is no more an esoteric concept. You can set it up anywhere and start shooting video. The magic begins in the post-production stage where you can use Wondershare Filmora to replace the green screen with video effects that will blow the mind of your viewers and followers. Filmora has intuitive options and controls through which you can apply green screen effect in simple steps.</p>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Glitch-Text-Effect"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Glitch-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Glitch Text Effect?"></a>How to Create a Glitch Text Effect?</h2><p>Have you noticed the glitching effect that appears when you play a video or in games, creating a sporadic shaky effect on video edges? While this usually signifies a systematic software issue in these cases, the effect itself can work to create a dynamic visual style for different objects when done intentionally.</p>
<p>In fact, many video editors today use the glitch effect on elements in their videos, like the introductory title in movies or trailers. It creates a futuristic look to the text, which highly appeals to viewers who engage more in the video itself.</p>
<p>Suppose you are looking to add a similar effect to the title of your video project or other text-based content that you will add to your video, use a good tool for that. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, in particular, makes adding this effect very simple.

Then, paste it just after the first clip ends, reducing its duration to around 1 second.</p>
<p>Then, double-click on the copied clip to open the text editing window. Click on the section where you can add the text and change it to the second word of your title.

Create and add the snapshots</h2><p>Following the previous step, click on the My Media section. Then, tap on the first clip in the collection and tap on the Snapshot icon at the end of the editing toolbar right above the timeline. Repeat this step for all the clips you have added until a snapshot of each of the words is stored in the media library.</p>
<p>Next, you have to grab hold of the first snapshot that you click and move it to the Track 1 of the timeline. Use the cursor to hold it and reduce the size of the clip to the same amount as the first clip on Track 1. To be sure, you can place the playhead at this point to see that the ending time for both clips is aligned.</p>

Adjust the text effect for the first word</h2><p>You have to click on the first-word snapshot in Track 1 of the Filmora editing timeline and double-click on it. Next, when the text editing window opens, you must change the Scale section to display the value of 290%. Following that, click on the slider in the Opacity parameter and decrease it to the 7% mark. Then, press the OK button.</p>
<p>On the timeline, right-click on this edited clip and choose the “Copy Effects” option from the drop-down menu.</p>

Drag and then drop it onto Track 1 of the editing timeline right next to the first clip. Then, hold the edge of this clip and reduce its size to fit the same duration as the second clip adjacent to it on Track 2.</p>
<p>Following that, you must choose this clip on Track 1 and right-click on top of it. Click on the “Paste Effects” option from the next drop-down menu, and the same adjustments will apply to this clip.</p>

For that, you must tap on the Effects tab from the top toolbar of Filmora- a list of many effects collections will appear on the left panel.</p>
<p>Scroll down until you reach the Filmstock option. You must click on it and find the Flicker option from the list. Under this collection, there are many options available. You must choose the Video_seg effect and drag it to the editing timeline above Track 2.</p>

                      alt="drag it down to the editing timeline"
                ></p>
<p>At this point, ensure the effect falls right above the first and second clip parts in the track below. Tap on the edges of this clip to reduce the size of the video effect, taking careful note to keep the clip 8 frames long overall.</p>
<p>Then, copy the cut-down effect from Track 3 and paste it at every intersectional point between the separated word-based clips in Track 2.</p>

Zoom in to edit the first effect layer</h2><p>Following this, you must zoom into the timeline for a better view and editing control for the next part.</p>
<p>Go to the Effects tab at the top and choose the Filters collection next. Under it, choose the Chaos 1 effect option, drag it down to the timeline, and place it above the previous clip on Track 4. Adjust the starting edge of this clip to have the same starting point as the Video_seg effect on Track 3 with an overall 8-frame duration.</p>

<h2 id="10-Edit-the-Effect-1"><a href="#10-Edit-the-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Edit the Effect"></a>10. Edit the Effect</h2><p>Next, you have to double-click on this clip to open the editing window for this effect. In this section, go to the Frequency parameter and increase the slider to 400. Following that, click on the Position X parameter and move the slider to the 0.20 point. Next, do the same for the Position Y parameter, but to the 0.70 point.</p>
<p>Change the Position Z parameter by typing the value 40 and disable the RGB Separate setting. Then, press the OK button and go to the timeline again.</p>

Adjust the Glitch effects</h2><p>Click on the effect clip on Track 4 and copy it. Please do the same as you did for the effect in Track 3 and paste it at the same locations between the clips in this track.</p>
<p>Afterward, go to the Effects tab again and choose the Filmstock tab. Among the collections here, you have to choose the Glitch option and select Glitch Stripe 1 from the collection. For an easier searching experience, you can directly type the effect in the search bar under the Effects tab.</p>

                      alt="select glitch stripe 1"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag and drop it on Track 5 of the timeline right above the previous effect and reduce its duration to the same level as the first two effects. Copy it and then paste the clip again for each clip-to-clip intersection.</p>
<p>After this part, drag the Glitch Dispersion effect down to the timeline. Place it above the previous effect and adjust the clip’s size to the same length. Again, copy the effect and repeat the steps again. Next, repeat the same whole process with the Negative Flicker effect from the Flicker collection on Track 7.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now, you are done with creating a visually exciting and dynamic look for your introductory or ending title in the video using the glitch effect. For the best results, you should practice this process sometimes to get used to it and even make certain preferential changes to the font style. Ultimately, with the help of this software, you can expect a high-quality title look and use it for further video editing work.</p>

Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.</p>
<p>The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.</p>

<p>Using this sophisticated converter, any PPT files made with 2013 or previous versions of PowerPoint may be quickly converted to movies. RZ PowerPoint video to ppt converter also allows you to create HD video files that can be readily shared online, as well as files that can be burnt to DVDs.</p>
<p>Any current video playback device can play videos generated with this program, and the quality is so outstanding that you can play them on huge LCD displays. Though this video to ppt converter is accessible for free, its free edition lacks all of the capabilities that make this program an excellent alternative for professionals that prepare PowerPoint presentations on a consistent basis. It’s possible to get the commercial edition of this Windows-based tool and have all of the multimedia you include in the presentations converted to video without losing any quality.</p>
<h5 id="Pros-3"><a href="#Pros-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>You may use this to burn DVDs.</p>

<p><strong>Price: A free trial is offered, and a single-user license is $249.</strong></p>
<p>There is much more to Camtasia Studio than simply a video to ppt converter in it. An unencumbered trial edition of this video editing program helps you create professional-looking films from PowerPoint presentations. Camtasia Studio’s single-user license is a good alternative for those who just need to convert a few presentations for free, but if you’re searching for a full-featured video to ppt converter, you should consider purchasing Camtasia.</p>

Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.</p>
<p>Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.</p>
<p>Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>custom slide show</strong> creation process with the finest details:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Tool</strong></p>
<p>Start the <strong>custom slide show PowerPoint</strong> creation process with launching the PowerPoint tool in any of your preferred devices. It would be better to work on a desktop or a PC. Proceed to open the presentation that you wish to create a custom slideshow from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Custom Slide Show Option</strong></p>
<p>In the welcome interface of PowerPoint, navigate to the ribbon at the top and hit the ‘Slide Show’ tab, followed by clicking on the ‘Custom Slide Show’ button from the ‘Options Panel’ that appears. As you tap the aforesaid button, a dropdown menu follows next, from where you need to choose the ‘Custom Shows…’ option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Custom Shows Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>The completion of Step 2 brings up the ‘Custom Shows’ dialog box, with a blank area at the left, indicating the absence of any custom slide show as yet. To create one, navigate to and click on the ‘New’ button at the right side within the dialog box.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Define Custom Show Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>As you tap the ‘New’ button, the ‘Define Custom Shows’ dialog box pops up with a display of the following fields and buttons:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slide Show Name Box</strong></p>
<p>Use this field to assign a name to your custom slideshow. In case you don’t add a name of your choice, PowerPoint will assign the name ‘Custom Show 1’ to your custom presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slides in Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Below the ‘Slide Show Name’ box, appears a list of slides in the chosen presentation which you can use to create the custom slide show. To add slides to the same, click on the respective slide names.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add Button</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Add’ button in the middle of the ‘Define Custom Show’ dialog box is used to include selected slides from the main list explained above to the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list at the right. The ‘Add’ button however, remains disabled until you make a selection from the main slides list to include within the custom slides list. Take note that you can choose to repeat the slides within the custom list.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Remove Button</strong></p>
<p>You can use this button to select and delete specific slides from the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list. The button however, remains disabled till you make a slide selection to be removed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slides in Custom Show</strong></p>
<p>This is a list of slides that you have selected from the main slides list to include in the custom slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Re-Order Buttons</strong></p>
<p>These are ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ arrows at the right side of the ‘Define Custom Show’ dialog box, which are active only if the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list has more than one slide to its credit. In such a case, you can use these arrows to change the sequence of appearance of the slides within the custom presentation.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Back to Custom Shows Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>When you have finished making all the required entries in the aforesaid fields, click on ‘OK’ to create your custom slideshow, which is visible in the ‘Custom Shows’ dialog box. You can preview the just created custom presentation by selecting the slideshow in the ‘Custom Shows’ list, followed by clicking on the ‘Show’ button at the bottom right of the dialog box.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The ‘Edit’ button, which allows you to make changes to a specific custom slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The ‘Remove’ button, which you can use to select and delete an existing custom presentation.</p>

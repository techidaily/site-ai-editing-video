Stay with us; we’ll show you how to freeze a frame in Sony Vegas in a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Filmmakers, YouTubers, and professional videographers use Sony Vegas, a professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Here is a guide on <strong>how to freeze-frame in Sony Vegas</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Import File</strong></p>
<p>Install the app on your device after downloading it. To import your file, open the software, create a new project, then select the Import Media button towards the top left portion of the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-make-sony-vegas-freeze-frame-1.jpg"
                      alt="Download and Import File"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Paste and Copy Video Parts</strong></p>
<p>Drag&#x2F;drop the imported file on the timeline, where you can stretch or zoom it. Now you can either play the video or move and stop the timeline marker where you wish to freeze the frame. After placing the marker, press S on the keyboard to split the video into two pieces. Then, copy and paste.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-make-sony-vegas-freeze-frame-2.jpg"
                      alt="Copy and Paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reduce the Velocity to 0%.</strong></p>
<p>Right-click on the pasted video segment and choose Insert&#x2F;Remove Envelope&gt;Velocity from the context menu. It will draw a light green border around the pasted video segment. Set to 0 percent Velocity by right-clicking on that green box. It will freeze the extra part, making it look like a frozen frame.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Disconnect the audio</strong></p>
<p>You may also detach audio with Sony Vegas. Select the frozen frame and press U on the keyboard to cut the background audio of the frozen area. Remove the audio segment from the timeline by clicking on it and deleting it. You can pick Delete from the right-click drop-down menu or use the Delete key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, attach the second part.</p>

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Your Videos to Merge</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Import Media Files Here” button to choose the videos you want to merge.</p>

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-11.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-12.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-13.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-15.jpeg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Run the setup and let the system complete the installation. Depending on the version, more or less, the software will look like this as you will open it on your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Your Videos to Merge</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Import Media Files Here” button to choose the videos you want to merge.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-12.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Clips on DaVinci Resolve Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing the software on your PC or MAC operating systems, open DaVinci Resolve and import two or more clips on the timeline.</p>
<p>For example, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Slide Clips and Select</strong></p>
<p>In the next step, slide both clips together, so there’s no gap left between them. And then, using your mouse, select both clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-3.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Make sure that all clips are on the same timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Merge Clips</strong></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the clips, right-click anywhere on the selection. And choose the “New Compound” option from the list of options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Now, rename the clip and hit the “Create” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve will merge the clips within a blink of an eye, as seen in this screenshot.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can see that within a few steps, you can easily merge videos using DaVinci Resolve. However, you should know that this software requires a heavy system to work smoothly. And sometimes, the quality and result are not up to the mark.</p>
<p>That is why most video editors prefer Filmora by Wondershare when editing and merging videos. So, let’s see how you can use Filmora to do the same task in the next part.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Open Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filmora’s official website and download the latest version for your MAC or Windows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Run the setup and let the system complete the installation. Depending on the version, more or less, the software will look like this as you will open it on your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Your Videos to Merge</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Import Media Files Here” button to choose the videos you want to merge.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-10.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-11.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-12.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-13.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-14.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-15.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You can merge several clips in just four steps without wasting your time looking around for options and losing the video quality.</p>

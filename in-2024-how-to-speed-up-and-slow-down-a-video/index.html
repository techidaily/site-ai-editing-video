In the older days, this feat was accomplished only by the big-budget filming industry.</p>
<p>This article will dive into how you can access the modern-day features available in video editing software. From these features, you can alter the speed of your video easily. However, before we get into the step-by-step guide, let’s understand what fast and slow-mo videos are.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Fast-and-Slow-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Fast-and-Slow-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Are Fast and Slow Motion Videos?"></a>Part 1. What Are Fast and Slow Motion Videos?</h2><p>As the name suggests, fast-motion videos are the ones that have been sped up from their average speed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-1.gif"
                      alt="difference between normal and fast speed"
                ></p>
<p>Similarly, slow-motion videos are the ones that have been slowed down from their average speed. The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-2.gif"
                      alt="difference between normal speed and slow speed"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are. Let’s understand their applications. Or how you can use them in your videos. Scroll below to learn more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 2. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>The answer to this question would be that it’s a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.</p>
<h3 id="Fast-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Fast-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Fast Motion Videos"></a>Fast Motion Videos</h3><p>Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.</p>
<p>The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.</p>
<p>The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.</p>
<h3 id="Slow-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Slow-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Slow Motion Videos"></a>Slow Motion Videos</h3><p>You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.</p>
<p>A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first <strong>Matrix</strong> film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-3.png"
                      alt="famous bullet dodging scene in the matrix"
                ></p>
<p>You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.</p>
<p>Before we get into the editing process, let’s first understand what you will need to change the speed of your videos!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-Will-You-Need-to-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-What-Will-You-Need-to-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Will You Need to Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 3. What Will You Need to Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>You will need the following essentials to change the speed of a video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Wondershare Filmora"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>To begin, you will need a good video editor. Wondershare Filmora is the best video editing software available. It has a very engaging system UI that allows inexperienced users to learn how to use it quickly. It also has a diverse collection of stock media. And not only that! It allows you to access reliable features to change the speed of a video.</p>
<p>You can change the speed of the video on Filmora by the speed adjustment panel or by the duration panel present above the timeline. It will adjust in just seconds with a few clicks. This feature makes Filmora more prior with editing tools.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Clips"><a href="#2-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Clips"></a>2. Video Clips</h3><p>Well, it is evident that to change the speed of your videos, you will need video clips. But there are a few things you can keep in mind before adjusting the speed of a video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-Can-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-Can-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 4. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speed adjustment panel.</li>
<li>Duration panel settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.</p>
<h3 id="1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel"><a href="#1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel" class="headerlink" title="1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel</h3><p>The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.</p>
<p>You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.</p>
<p>But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Download-Filmora"><a href="#Step1-Download-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download Filmora"></a>Step1 Download Filmora</h5><p>First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Import-The-Video-Files"><a href="#Step2-Import-The-Video-Files" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Import The Video Files"></a>Step2 Import The Video Files</h5><p>The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and select the <strong>Import</strong> icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>It takes you to your computer’s library.</li>
<li>Select the videos to be edited and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-5.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory"
                ></p>
<p>You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the cursor to select the video clips you want.</li>
<li>Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png"
                      alt="import video clips by drag and drop"
                ></p>
<p>Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the <strong>Mp4</strong>,   <strong>AVI</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>GIFs,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline</h5><p>After you’ve imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>insert</strong> them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel"><a href="#Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel</h5><p>The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li>
<li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"
                ></p>
<p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p>
<p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li>
<li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step5-Detach-The-Audio"><a href="#Step5-Detach-The-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Detach The Audio"></a>Step5 Detach The Audio</h5><p>The corresponding audio also gets affected when you slow down or speed up a video. In this scenario, you can also choose to detach the audio beforehand. It allows you to maintain the original playback speed. To detach the audio, follow the steps as mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop-up column, scroll down to the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> option and click on it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="wondershare filmora detaching audio"
                ></p>

<li>A settings menu will open in the import window.</li>
<li>Adjust the <strong>Fade</strong> options for your Audio.</li>

                      alt="wondershare filmora adjusting detached audio"
                ></p>
<p>You can also remove the background noise and the pitch of the audio if you want. You can also replace the video’s original audio with a new one. Click on the audio file and press <strong>Del</strong> on the keyboard to delete it. To add new audio, do as mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on The <strong>Audio</strong> icon above the import window.</li>
<li>Browse The Audio that matches the vibe of your video.</li>
<li>Drag and drop it below your video clip.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="wondershare filmora adding custom audio"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have created alternate audio for your video. Play the video from the start and confirm your changes.</p>

<p>These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let’s move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.</p>
<h3 id="2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel"><a href="#2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel" class="headerlink" title="2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel"></a>2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel</h3><p>The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.</p>
<p>This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.</p>
<p>It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.</p>
<p>Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline"><a href="#Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and click the <strong>Import</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>Choose the videos to be edited, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, insert them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel"><a href="#Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Open The Duration Panel"></a>Step2 Open The Duration Panel</h5><p>The Duration Panel comes attached to the <strong>Unifrom Speed Panel</strong>. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop column, scroll below to <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video"><a href="#Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change The Speed of The Video"></a>Step3 Change The Speed of The Video</h5><p>In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to <strong>reduce</strong> the speed of your video, you have to <strong>increase</strong> the duration of your video. Similarly, if you’re going to <strong>increase</strong> the speed of your video, you would have to <strong>decrease</strong> the duration.</p>
<h5 id="Slow-Down-The-Video"><a href="#Slow-Down-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Slow Down The Video"></a>Slow Down The Video</h5><p>To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>Increase</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number bigger than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the average speed of the video is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> increasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:02:00:00</strong> will reduce the speed of your video by half.</p>
<p><img

<h5 id="Speed-Up-The-Video"><a href="#Speed-Up-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Speed Up The Video"></a>Speed Up The Video</h5><p>To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>decrease</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number smaller than the normal value</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the normal video speed is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> decreasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:00:30:00</strong> will increase the speed of your video by double.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.</p>

The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The speed adjustment panel.</li>
<li>Duration panel settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.</p>
<h3 id="1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1"><a href="#1-Change-Speed-With-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>1. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel</h3><p>The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.</p>
<p>You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.</p>
<p>But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Download-Filmora-1"><a href="#Step1-Download-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download Filmora"></a>Step1 Download Filmora</h5><p>First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.</p>

<p>Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the <strong>Mp4</strong>,   <strong>AVI</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>GIFs,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline</h5><p>After you’ve imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>insert</strong> them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1"><a href="#Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel</h5><p>The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li>
<li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"
                ></p>
<p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p>
<p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li>
<li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

<h3 id="08Stick-to-a-Reduced-File-Size"><a href="#08Stick-to-a-Reduced-File-Size" class="headerlink" title="08Stick to a Reduced File Size"></a>08Stick to a Reduced File Size</h3><p>Creating GIF of within a standard size range is quite difficult, owing to the fact that these are shared across a variety of media platforms, each having a different file size constraint. It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-1"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-1" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-1"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-1" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-1"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-1" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-1"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-1" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-1"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-1" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-1"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-1" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-2"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-2"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-2" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-2"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-2" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-2"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-2" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-2"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-2" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-2"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-2" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators.

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-2"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-2" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-3"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-3"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-3" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-3"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-3" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-3"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-3" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-3"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-3" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-3"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-3" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-3"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-3" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

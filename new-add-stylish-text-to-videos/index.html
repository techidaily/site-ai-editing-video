<h2 id="What-is-the-importance-of-Adding-Stylish-Text"><a href="#What-is-the-importance-of-Adding-Stylish-Text" class="headerlink" title="What is the importance of Adding Stylish Text?"></a>What is the importance of Adding Stylish Text?</h2><p>As a Youtuber, creating thumbnails is one of the essential aspects of getting the attention of your audience. A thumbnail is a small image inserted into a video that exemplifies larger content inside the video or article. Millions of videos are produced and uploaded on the Internet every single day, so it’s essential for yours to stand out. Text on videos has several different added benefits as well. In this video, we’ll give four reasons why you should start adding text to your videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Content-becomes-easy-to-remember"><a href="#1-Content-becomes-easy-to-remember" class="headerlink" title="1. Content becomes easy to remember"></a><strong>1. Content becomes easy to remember</strong></h3><p>Viewer Retention (sometimes referred to as “Audience Retention”) is the average percentage of a video that people watch. Videos with high Viewer Retention scores tend to sell more. Adding some Text&#x2F;Title in your video is one of the critical factors to remember because the viewers get multiple cue points (example: audio and text on video) to confirm their understanding and retain the essence of the messaging.</p>
<h3 id="2-Make-sense-even-without-sound"><a href="#2-Make-sense-even-without-sound" class="headerlink" title="2. Make sense even without sound"></a><strong>2. Make sense even without sound</strong></h3><p>A lot of people watch videos on mute mode. A recent study indicates that 85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound. A lot of us consume videos while in transit and sometimes at work as well :).</p>
<p>Text is very expository for most of these videos since it’d help in building the proper context for the viewer.</p>
<h3 id="3-It-Helps-Summarize-Key-Points"><a href="#3-It-Helps-Summarize-Key-Points" class="headerlink" title="3. It Helps Summarize Key Points"></a><strong>3. It Helps Summarize Key Points</strong></h3><p>Some audiences are looking for a summary of the video in an instant to save more time. As Youtuber, it is very helpful if you will add Text&#x2F;Titles as caption perse in a video. For example, one needs to remember 2-3 tips for driving. If the captions or text show up on the video when the driver talks about this and that, that’s better!</p>
<h3 id="4-Aesthetics"><a href="#4-Aesthetics" class="headerlink" title="4. Aesthetics"></a><strong>4. Aesthetics</strong></h3><p>Some people don’t care much about the graphics; they just go through the textual content. This is because texts are the major sources of information. Adding Styling Text&#x2F;Titles can make a video engaging and attractive. The audience wants to see some color and action in the videos to grasp the storyboard easily.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-the-importance-of-Adding-Stylish-Text-1"><a href="#What-is-the-importance-of-Adding-Stylish-Text-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the importance of Adding Stylish Text?"></a>What is the importance of Adding Stylish Text?</h2><p>As a Youtuber, creating thumbnails is one of the essential aspects of getting the attention of your audience. A thumbnail is a small image inserted into a video that exemplifies larger content inside the video or article. Millions of videos are produced and uploaded on the Internet every single day, so it’s essential for yours to stand out. Text on videos has several different added benefits as well. In this video, we’ll give four reasons why you should start adding text to your videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Content-becomes-easy-to-remember-1"><a href="#1-Content-becomes-easy-to-remember-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Content becomes easy to remember"></a><strong>1. Content becomes easy to remember</strong></h3><p>Viewer Retention (sometimes referred to as “Audience Retention”) is the average percentage of a video that people watch. Videos with high Viewer Retention scores tend to sell more. Adding some Text&#x2F;Title in your video is one of the critical factors to remember because the viewers get multiple cue points (example: audio and text on video) to confirm their understanding and retain the essence of the messaging.</p>
<h3 id="2-Make-sense-even-without-sound-1"><a href="#2-Make-sense-even-without-sound-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Make sense even without sound"></a><strong>2. Make sense even without sound</strong></h3><p>A lot of people watch videos on mute mode. A recent study indicates that 85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound. A lot of us consume videos while in transit and sometimes at work as well :).</p>
<p>Text is very expository for most of these videos since it’d help in building the proper context for the viewer.</p>
<h3 id="3-It-Helps-Summarize-Key-Points-1"><a href="#3-It-Helps-Summarize-Key-Points-1" class="headerlink" title="3. It Helps Summarize Key Points"></a><strong>3. It Helps Summarize Key Points</strong></h3><p>Some audiences are looking for a summary of the video in an instant to save more time. As Youtuber, it is very helpful if you will add Text&#x2F;Titles as caption perse in a video. For example, one needs to remember 2-3 tips for driving. If the captions or text show up on the video when the driver talks about this and that, that’s better!</p>
<h3 id="4-Aesthetics-1"><a href="#4-Aesthetics-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Aesthetics"></a><strong>4. Aesthetics</strong></h3><p>Some people don’t care much about the graphics; they just go through the textual content. This is because texts are the major sources of information. Adding Styling Text&#x2F;Titles can make a video engaging and attractive. The audience wants to see some color and action in the videos to grasp the storyboard easily.</p>

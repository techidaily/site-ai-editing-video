This takes away the pressure on the CPU resources, but when it renders, the original resolution gets restored back. That is why Kdenlive has been effective in low-end computers as well.</p>
<p>Flexible User Interface – Kdenlive comes with a customizable user interface. This means you can arrange the layouts of your workflow as per your requirements. Besides, there are configurable keyboard shortcuts. There are also different themes available for the user interface.</p>
<p>Keyframing – One of the advanced features of Kdenlive is that you can keyframe any effect. This means you can change the parameters of the effects with time using curves. Besides, the software supports green screen effect.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous – The software supports almost all types of audio and video file formats. There is an option for automatic backup which is highly useful in any video editing software. The software also supports online resources and add-ons.</p>

You should however, take care to stop losing your self-confidence amid the process of reaching at your desired goal.</p>

When you take images or record sound, you frequently end up with distorted results due to lens distortion. In this article, we will discuss what lens distortion is, how it may be fixed, and the factors you need to pay attention to avoid lens distortion when taking or recording videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Basic-introduction-to-lens-distortion"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-introduction-to-lens-distortion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion"></a>Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion</h2><p><strong>1. What is lens distortion</strong></p>
<p>Distortion means that the straight rectilinear projection is not straight. In the pinhole camera model, lens distortion is measured by how far from the image’s ideal projection is. From a geometric optics point of view, the scene’s straight lines don’t look straight in the image.</p>
<p>When you take a picture, the camera lens can somehow change the shape of the image. It is called camera lens distortion. In simple terms, we can tell you that this is the case because distortion in-camera is when the lens makes curved lines in an image and doesn’t show the straight lines from the scene.</p>
<p><strong>2. What cause it</strong></p>
<p>Lens distortion happens with all lenses. It is because of several things, such as how the lens is curved, how far away the subject is, and the angle at which the photo was taken. Furthermore, it changes the image in many ways, but you can see it most when straight lines at the frame’s edges are no longer parallel.</p>
<p>Most geometric lens distortions happen when the focal distance is short (barrel distortion), long (pincushion distortion), or when a fish-eye lens is used to take a picture from a low angle (keystone distortion).</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-correct-a-distorted-lens"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-correct-a-distorted-lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?"></a>Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?</h2><p>A lot of times, with lower-end wide-angle lenses, especially action cams like GoPro, you get pretty gnarly distortion when you’re filming. As we know, the Earth is round, but it shouldn’t look like this when you take a picture. Indeed, it’s very distorted, it has the horizon line bending all over the place, and basically, all of the lines in the video have some level of curvature.</p>
<p>Hence, follow all the steps below to know how to fix it:</p>
<p>Step1 Import your video to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p>Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the “Camera model” based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="click on the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To adjust the distortion, you can slide the bar to the left or the right. If you slide the bar to the right (maximum level), there will be no adjustment. However, if you slide the bar to the left, you can see it pulling those lines as high up as possible.</p>
<p>You can see a bit of curvature, but it looks much more natural, and all of the lines in the video look so much better.</p>

Avoid very wide-angle lenses</strong></p>
<p>The more distortion there is in a lens, like a 15mm prime, the wider it is. Sometimes you need a very wide-angle lens, and distortion is unavoidable. If you have room to move back, you could try using a lens with a different focal length.</p>
<p><strong>2. Avoid getting too close</strong></p>
<p>Doing so will enhance optical distortion in many lenses and the likelihood of perspective distortion in all lenses.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be mindful of your composition</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous instances where distortion is acceptable or even intended. Others must be carefully examined, such as utilizing a wide-angle lens to photograph a row of people. When you get too close to a group, the distortion makes the people at each end appear considerably wider! Therefore, consider your composition. Stand back and add space around your group; if necessary, you can trim the image afterward.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use a 50mm lens</strong></p>
<p>50mm lenses are often called “all-purpose” lenses. There is a good reason</p>
<p>for this. A 50mm lens is great for portraits, street photography, and many other kinds of photography, including architecture. If your subject is big, you just need space to stand back. You will see that a 50mm lens rarely distorts the image.</p>

<p>Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the “Camera model” based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.</p>

                      alt="click on the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To adjust the distortion, you can slide the bar to the left or the right. If you slide the bar to the right (maximum level), there will be no adjustment. However, if you slide the bar to the left, you can see it pulling those lines as high up as possible.</p>
<p>You can see a bit of curvature, but it looks much more natural, and all of the lines in the video look so much better.</p>

Avoid very wide-angle lenses</strong></p>
<p>The more distortion there is in a lens, like a 15mm prime, the wider it is. Sometimes you need a very wide-angle lens, and distortion is unavoidable. If you have room to move back, you could try using a lens with a different focal length.</p>
<p><strong>2. Avoid getting too close</strong></p>
<p>Doing so will enhance optical distortion in many lenses and the likelihood of perspective distortion in all lenses.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be mindful of your composition</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous instances where distortion is acceptable or even intended. Others must be carefully examined, such as utilizing a wide-angle lens to photograph a row of people. When you get too close to a group, the distortion makes the people at each end appear considerably wider! Therefore, consider your composition. Stand back and add space around your group; if necessary, you can trim the image afterward.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use a 50mm lens</strong></p>
<p>50mm lenses are often called “all-purpose” lenses. There is a good reason</p>
<p>for this. A 50mm lens is great for portraits, street photography, and many other kinds of photography, including architecture. If your subject is big, you just need space to stand back. You will see that a 50mm lens rarely distorts the image.</p>

<h2 id="Trailer-Guide-for-Creators-and-Developers"><a href="#Trailer-Guide-for-Creators-and-Developers" class="headerlink" title="Trailer Guide for Creators and Developers"></a>Trailer Guide for Creators and Developers</h2><p>Trailers are a popular means to showcase a product you are about to release to the market. Teasers and trailers are traditionally created for movies, but have eventually evolved to include book trailers, game trailers, and app trailers. In this article, we will explain the key details of a trailer, highlight some examples, and show you how to create an effective trailer.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Trailer"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a Trailer?"></a>Part 1. What is a Trailer?</h2><p>A trailer is a type of video commercial advertisement made to advertise and inform audiences about a specific program or item. To persuade customers to view or use the product, it includes a brief series of previews of the entire material. It also serves as a means of creating anticipation for a show or product that is about to hit the market.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/trailer-guide-1.jpg"
                      alt="trailer-guide"
                ></p>
<p>Trailers were originally made for cinema movies. Nowadays, trailers are created for different forms of media like shows, apps, programs, video games, and book videos. A typical traditional trailer lasts between 1 to 3 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences-Between-a-Teaser-and-Trailer"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Similarities-and-Differences-Between-a-Teaser-and-Trailer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Are the Similarities and Differences Between a Teaser and Trailer?"></a>Part 2. What Are the Similarities and Differences Between a Teaser and Trailer?</h2><p>Teasers and trailers can often be confused with each other. After all, they pretty much have the same objective.</p>
<p>Both are created for the purpose of advertising an upcoming show, product, or service. Teasers and trailers are similarly shown to audiences prior to the release of the thing they are advertising. They are meant to show a small portion of the full experience to create curiosity and excitement towards a targeted market. Both videos are typically short in length - taking up only a maximum of 3 minutes in duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/trailer-guide-2.jpg"
                      alt="trailer-guide"
                ></p>
<p>The differences between them lie in their content, timeline, and duration. A teaser is much shorter than a trailer - the former runs for only 20-30 seconds while the latter can go between 1-3 minutes in length. This is because teasers are typically made before or during the production process of a movie or feature, whilst trailers are commonly made at the end.</p>
<p>For films, movies, and shows, teasers generally capture only a single part of that media. It focuses on the most intense or impactful scene. Trailers are formed from a series of clips depicting striking scenes derived from the beginning, middle, and end of the show. These scenes are normally arranged in a nonlinear structure, allowing viewers to have a general understanding of the story without revealing the entirety of the plot.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Examples-of-good-trailers"><a href="#Part-3-Examples-of-good-trailers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Examples of good trailers"></a>Part 3. Examples of good trailers</h2><p>An excellent trailer is one who can effectively attract and maintain the audience’s attention. It satisfies its objective of showcasing striking and captivating pieces of the main product and entices viewers to experience its entirety. Here are some examples of trailers who have well fulfilled the criteria of a good trailer.</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Suicide-Squad"><a href="#1-The-Suicide-Squad" class="headerlink" title="1. The Suicide Squad"></a>1. The Suicide Squad</h3><p>The Suicide Squad is a fresh take featuring DC’s anti-heroes assemble in a single chaotic and unconventional team. James Gunn’s iteration on these characters is brought to life in the trailer with a majestic cast including John Cena, Idris Elba, Margot Robbie, and David Dastmalchian. Several key scenes are shown, highlighting its standout characters in the process while portraying the movie’s setting.</p>
<h3 id="2-Raya-and-the-Last-Dragon"><a href="#2-Raya-and-the-Last-Dragon" class="headerlink" title="2. Raya and the Last Dragon"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/1VIZ89FEjYI" >Raya and the Last Dragon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The trailer starts out innocently and comes with an adorable and surprising twist. The brief 2-minute trailer is packed with relevant scenes that depict the character’s quest without revealing too much. Many action-packed scenes and emotional interactions are satisfactorily squeezed into the trailer. Excitement builds further with Tamara Bubble’s “I’m That Good” playing in the background on the last minute of the video.</p>
<h3 id="3-Men-2022"><a href="#3-Men-2022" class="headerlink" title="3. Men (2022)"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/HKJ4Thgk1Js" >Men (2022) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Ingenious combination of sound effects and background music play a distinct role in this 2022 trailer. The female lead’s voice echoing from a tunnel, the haunting piano keys gradually building up the suspense, and the common but cleverly used horror audio effects create a chilling ensemble of haunting scenes in the movie. The sounds gradually rise up as more aggressive and energized scenes flash on the screen, and eventually end back into the sombre intro that leaves the audience with questions.</p>
<h3 id="4-The-Farewell"><a href="#4-The-Farewell" class="headerlink" title="4. The Farewell"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/RofpAjqwMa8" >The Farewell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Lulu Wang’s dramatic comedy The Farewell is all about a family hiding the truth of a family member’s terminal illness from the person herself. What makes the trailer special is that it steers away from the sad, melancholic direction and veers toward a feel-good movie vibe. The conflict, struggle, and the beliefs featured in the movie are depicted in the trailer. However, the clever placement of interactions and the uplifting music tug at the audience’s heartstrings and urge them to want to see more.</p>
<h3 id="5-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#5-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="5. Pokémon Go"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/2sj2iQyBTQs" >Pokémon Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Pokémon has become a culture to several generations. Becoming a Pokémon trainer is a secret dream that almost all of us have, even as adults. Niantic’s collaboration with the Pokémon franchise brings people closer to that reality by introducing its AR and location-powered app Pokémon Go. The trailer shows people of all ages living out their trainer dreams in the real world and interacting with Pokémon. The different features of the game are dramatized in a real-life setting, inciting more excitement, and pulling out the nostalgia from its market. The trailer keeps the actual app showcase to a minimum, instead focusing on once again selling that dream to audiences and bringing out the inner child in everyone.</p>

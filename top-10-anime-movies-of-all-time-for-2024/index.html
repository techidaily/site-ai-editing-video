The movie is a split-up craft of the biggest names in the anime world and features shots directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Katsuhiro Otomo and Rintaro. The film got its existing name during its re-release in 1989 by Streamline Pictures to avoid a title clash with Otomo’s allied production Akira, that had hit the screens in the same year.</p>
<p>Viewing through the specific shorts in particular, the ‘Labyrinth Labyrinthos’ directed by Rintaro is inspired by German Expressionism in cohesion with the craft of Salvador Dali. The plot follows Sachi, a notorious young girl who, via the dresser’s looking glass, gets drawn into the gloomy space of a hallucinating quirkiness, along with Cicerone, her pet kitten.</p>
<p>As of ‘The Running Man’ directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the latter is an ugly science fiction noir short that draws its inspiration from Blade Runner. The storyteller here is a sports correspondent who gets the privilege to see Jack Hugh’s last race. This legendary sports star of a dangerous running tournament was then reported to have imbibed fatal psionic tendencies.</p>
<p>Reserving the best for the last, here enters ‘Construction Cancellation Order’, the last short directed by Katsuhiro Omoto. The story progresses with the journey of Tsutomu Sugioka, who is sent to a fictitious and remote area in Aloana Republic, a city in South America by his seniors. His job is to shut down Facility 444, a remote construction project of his Japanese company.</p>
<p>Put collectively, Neo-Tokyo is a masterpiece of technical excellence that showcases the bright future of amine movies, provided that they are crafted by the most unique film creators of the anime world.</p>

<p>If you are looking forward to understanding how to create a funny vlog for your TikTok using Filmora, you need to follow a set of simple steps. These are shown as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch and Import Video</p>
<p>To start, you need to have Wondershare Filmora installed across your device. Launch the tool and click on “New Project” to start from scratch. Once the screen opens up, you need to click on the “Arrow Head” icon across the ‘Media’ Tab to import the audio you wish to amend for TikTok.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/funny-vlog-for-tiktok-7.jpg"
                      alt="import your tiktok video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Perform Basic Editing</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora provides users with multiple options for editing their files. At first, drag the file onto the timeline. Following this, you can merge different videos or enhance the video by trimming it. Along with that, you can also consider splitting the image or changing its playback speed for different results.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/funny-vlog-for-tiktok-8.jpg"
                      alt="use filmora basic editing tools"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Add Effects and Transitions</p>
<p>After you are done with some basic editing, you can add different effects from the “Effects” section. To make the video look exclusive, you can also include “Transitions” across it. Use the “Elements” tab to include stickers and emojis to enhance your TikTok video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/funny-vlog-for-tiktok-9.jpg"
                      alt="use effects transitions or elements"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Manage the Audio</p>
<p>For managing the audio of your video, you can make several changes across it. You can detach audio and change the audio with another soundtrack. Filmora also allows you to add audio from the “Audio” section, which contains royalty-free music to add. Once you are done, click on the “Export” button to set the settings of the video before exporting it back onto the device.</p>

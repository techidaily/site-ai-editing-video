<h2 id="Overview-and-Installation-of-FFmpeg"><a href="#Overview-and-Installation-of-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Overview and Installation of FFmpeg"></a>Overview and Installation of FFmpeg</h2><p>FFmpeg is free, open-source project that allows you to record, convert, and stream digital audio and video. It is a command-line tool widely used in video editing and transcoding. FFmpeg can be used to concatenate videos and other tasks, such as adding subtitles, changing video resolution, and more. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a versatile and accessible tool for anyone to use.</p>
<p>Here’s how to install FFmpeg:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Log in</strong> to your Ubuntu server via SSH and <strong>update</strong> the package index.</p>
<p><em>$ sudo apt update</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Install</strong> FFmpeg and all the required dependencies</p>
<p><em>$ sudo apt install ffmpeg</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Verify</strong> the version of FFmpeg that you’ve installed.</p>
<p><em>$ ffmpeg -version</em></p>
<h2 id="Prerequisite"><a href="#Prerequisite" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisite"></a>Prerequisite</h2><p>Before we merge videos using FFmpeg, we must understand the various methods available to us. FFmpeg offers three ways to concatenate videos: a demuxer, a filter, or a protocol. However, each method has its own set of considerations, and the best method for you will depend on the properties of the videos you’re working with.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you’re merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It’s essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-Videos-With-Same-Codecs-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#Concatenate-Videos-With-Same-Codecs-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg</h3><p>If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg “concat” demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn’t require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the “concat” demuxer and “concat” protocols in FFmpeg.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Videos With the “Concat” Demuxer</strong></p>
<p>The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Create</strong> a <strong>.txt file and list</strong> the paths of the video files you want to merge.</p>
<p><em>Join_video.txt</em></p>
<p><em>file &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Video&#x2F;input1.mp4</em></p>
<p><em>file &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Video&#x2F;input2.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can add more than two video files.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Run</strong> the FFmpeg command:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join_video.txt -c copy output_demuxer.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: <em>-safe 0</em></strong> is added to accept any file name.</p>
<p><strong><em>-c copy</em></strong> will copy all the streams.</p>
<p>As this method allows you to “stream copy” the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.</p>
<p><strong>Join Videos With the “Concat” Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use the “concat protocol:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Run</strong> the FFmpeg command:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i “concat:input1.ts|input2.ts” -c copy output_protocol.ts</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The concat protocol allows you to “stream copy” the files by adding the option <strong><em>-c copy</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Input</strong> the file name of the video using this code:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i “concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4” -c copy output_protocol.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.</p>
<p>Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it’s very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It’s a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-MP4-Video-Files-of-Different-Codecs-Resolutions-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#Concatenate-MP4-Video-Files-of-Different-Codecs-Resolutions-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs &amp; Resolutions Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs &amp; Resolutions Using FFmpeg</h3><p>If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Provide</strong> the names of the input files to FFmpeg.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.</p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “[0:v] [0:a] [1:v] [1:a] [2:v] [2:a]</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: [0:v][0:a]</strong> means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).</p>
<p>Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n&#x3D;3).</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1 [vv] [aa]“ \</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1</strong> implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.</p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Map</strong> these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:</p>
<p><em>-map “[vv]“ -map “[aa]“ mergedVideo.mp4</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-Videos-With-Multiple-Audio-Streams-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#Concatenate-Videos-With-Multiple-Audio-Streams-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg</h3><p>Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We’ll be using the filter_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Specify</strong> the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:</p>
<p><em>$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.</p>
<p><em>[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: Single video stream</strong> ([0:0], [1:0], [2:0])</p>
<p><strong>Dual audio streams</strong> ([0:1][0:2], [1:1][1:2], [2:1][2:2])</p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>concat</strong> filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n&#x3D;3) with 1 video stream (v&#x3D;1) and 2 audio streams (a&#x3D;2). Specify the output streams as [v], [a1], [a2]:</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;2 [v] [a1] [a2]</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-map</strong> option to map the output streams to the final video container:</p>
<p><em>-map ‘[v]‘ -map ‘[a1]‘ -map ‘[a2]‘ output.mkv</em></p>

<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1 [vv] [aa]“ \</em></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1</strong> implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.</p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Map</strong> these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:</p>
<p><em>-map “[vv]“ -map “[aa]“ mergedVideo.mp4</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.</p>

This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We’ll be using the filter_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Specify</strong> the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:</p>
<p><em>$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.</p>
<p><em>[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]</em></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: Single video stream</strong> ([0:0], [1:0], [2:0])</p>
<p><strong>Dual audio streams</strong> ([0:1][0:2], [1:1][1:2], [2:1][2:2])</p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>concat</strong> filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n&#x3D;3) with 1 video stream (v&#x3D;1) and 2 audio streams (a&#x3D;2). Specify the output streams as [v], [a1], [a2]:</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;2 [v] [a1] [a2]</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-map</strong> option to map the output streams to the final video container:</p>
<p><em>-map ‘[v]‘ -map ‘[a1]‘ -map ‘[a2]‘ output.mkv</em></p>

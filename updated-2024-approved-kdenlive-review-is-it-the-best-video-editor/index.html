Key Features of Kdenlive</h2><p>If you need to edit videos occasionally, a free video editor is what you will be looking for.

<p>Proxy Editing – Kdenlive uses proxy editing technique to lower the resolution of high-resolution videos while you edit them. This takes away the pressure on the CPU resources, but when it renders, the original resolution gets restored back. That is why Kdenlive has been effective in low-end computers as well.</p>
<p>Flexible User Interface – Kdenlive comes with a customizable user interface. This means you can arrange the layouts of your workflow as per your requirements. Besides, there are configurable keyboard shortcuts. There are also different themes available for the user interface.</p>
<p>Keyframing – One of the advanced features of Kdenlive is that you can keyframe any effect. This means you can change the parameters of the effects with time using curves. Besides, the software supports green screen effect.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous – The software supports almost all types of audio and video file formats. There is an option for automatic backup which is highly useful in any video editing software. The software also supports online resources and add-ons.</p>

Create a slow-motion video to emphasize certain information in the video. It involves technical and creative elements for a good-quality video. You can read this section to understand the points that contribute to a good Slow-motion video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Keep the frame rate higher for a good slow-motion video. In this regard, you can use common frame rates such as 60fps, 120fps, and 140fps. Moreover, you should pick video clips that are originally captured in a high frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Editing and Timing:</strong> Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.</li>

<h3 id="Solution-4-Disable-the-Live-Save-Feature-1"><a href="#Solution-4-Disable-the-Live-Save-Feature-1" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature"></a>Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature</h3><p>Every change you make gets saved with the Live Save option in DaVinci Resolve. If your remote drive is linked, this feature can drag the playback speed down. You can disable it for a <strong>DaVinci resolve faster playback</strong>.</p>
<p>Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.</p>

Proxy files are small copy files transcoded from a larger, original video file. Get the proxy file to increase the playback and go to your “Media Pool” in DaVinci Resolve. Right-click on the intended file and choose “Generate Proxy Media” from the list.</p>

Create a slow-motion video to emphasize certain information in the video. It involves technical and creative elements for a good-quality video. You can read this section to understand the points that contribute to a good Slow-motion video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Keep the frame rate higher for a good slow-motion video. In this regard, you can use common frame rates such as 60fps, 120fps, and 140fps. Moreover, you should pick video clips that are originally captured in a high frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Editing and Timing:</strong> Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.</li>
</ul>

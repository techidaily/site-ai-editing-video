<p><em>This guide uses Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 and Wondershare Filmora X.</em></p>
<h2 id="How-to-cut-video-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-cut-video-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?"></a>How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Once you have Adobe Premiere Pro open on your computer, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new project in Premiere Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p>During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p>You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create <strong>Bins</strong>, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.</p>
<p><em>Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above).</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.</p>
<p>Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p>**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._</p>
<p>We also recommend using the <em>Snap in Timeline</em> feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.</p>
<p>-—————————————————————————————————————————————-</p>
<p><strong>Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an <strong>In Point</strong>and an <strong>Out Point.</strong> These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons [marked in Yellow] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.</li>
<li>You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.</li>

<p>The Bottom Line</p>
<p>As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.</p>
<p>During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.</p>

<p>You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create <strong>Bins</strong>, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.</p>
<p><em>Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above).</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.</p>
<p>Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._</p>
<p>We also recommend using the <em>Snap in Timeline</em> feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.</p>

<p><strong>Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an <strong>In Point</strong>and an <strong>Out Point.</strong> These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons [marked in Yellow] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.</li>
<li>You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.</li>

<p>**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._</p>
<p>We also recommend using the <em>Snap in Timeline</em> feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.</p>

<p><strong>Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an <strong>In Point</strong>and an <strong>Out Point.</strong> These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons [marked in Yellow] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.</li>
<li>You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.</li>

Opening the application throws you straight into a project, and following this, you can import a video file and begin editing. From the process you will learn below, it is easy to assume that Wondershare Filmora is more convenient for beginners and provides software features that match paid professional software.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t have Wondershare Filmora installed, you can get the video editor by visiting its <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Once the setup program download completes, execute it and begin the installation process.</p>
<p>Once you have the editing software open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import a video file by clicking on the import window.</p>
<p>The default project setting for Filmora X is 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. Users can change this to match their video file by going into Project Settings under the File tab or by accepting the automatic prompt that appears when dragging the video file onto the Timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a PC with weak hardware, Wondershare Filmora gives you the option to create Video Proxies that will reduce the load on your computer by creating smaller clips that are lower in size, resulting in a smoother and faster experience. You can also do this in Premiere Pro, but Filmora does it for you automatically once given permission.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the video file onto the Timeline to begin previewing it in the Playback Window and commence editing operations.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Locate where you want to cut in the video file and click on the orange scissors option to split the video file.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B) to cut without using a mouse click, in case you make use of a trackpad while editing.</p>
<p>The Bottom Line</p>
<p>As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate.

The increase in technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antennas, Wi-Fi RTT, and ultra-wideband (UWB) make indoor navigation much more practical than before.

                ></p>
<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Now, apply the same method as in <strong>Step 14</strong> to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.</p>

<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, <strong>Enable</strong> the <strong>Outline</strong> option and <strong>Disable</strong> the <strong>Fill</strong> option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 17</p>
<p>Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.</p>

<p>Step 19</p>
<p>Set the Playhead to 1 second and 40 frames. Now, double-click on the last Default Title we just created and go to its <strong>Animation settings. NOTE:</strong> Don’t open its Advanced settings this time. Next, add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead near the end of this clip in the Timeline. Now, drag the X position to the left until you see the last letter of your text appear on the screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>Step 20</p>
<p>Now, add another Default Title to the Timeline. Open its Advanced settings and type in your main text. Then, go to its <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the “Random 2” animation. Change its starting and end times according to your preference. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="project settings filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Open the <strong>Titles</strong> tab and drag the <strong>Default Title</strong> to the Timeline. Then, double-click on the Default Title and click on <strong>ADVANCED.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/default-title.png"
                      alt="default title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>From the Advanced settings panel, delete the existing text and add a <strong>Rectangle shape.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="advanced title settings filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Disable the <strong>Text Fill</strong> and the <strong>Shape Border</strong> options from the panel on the left side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/disable.png"
                      alt="disable options"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Click the drop-down arrow on the <strong>Shape Fill</strong> option and change the <strong>Type</strong> to <strong>Gradient Fill.</strong> Then, adjust the two color pallets from lighter to darker to create a gradient effect. Finally, adjust the rectangle to fit the entire screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shape-fill.png"
                      alt="shape fill settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Transitions</strong> tab <strong>→</strong> search for “<strong>Push</strong>” <strong>→</strong> drag the Push transition to the Default Title in the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag another Default Title to that point from the <strong>Titles</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/push.png"
                      alt="push transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the new Default Title <strong>→</strong> go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Delete the default text and add a <strong>Circle</strong> shape this time instead of a Rectangle. Disable the <strong>Text Fill and Shape Fill</strong> options this time.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Scroll down to <strong>Shape Border</strong> and increase the <strong>Thickness</strong> bar all the way up. Then, change the circle’s color to match your background as closely as possible. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/borders.png"
                      alt="shape border filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Copy the Title you just edited and paste it into the above layer. Then, double-click on the copied Title and go to its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy.png"
                      alt="copy title"
                ></p>
<p>Step 11</p>
<p>In the Advanced panel, copy the circle and paste it somewhere else on the screen. Change its size if you want, and change the shade of its color to match the background once more. You can add as many new copies of the Default Titles and copy as many circles as you want. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy-circle.png"
                      alt="add more circles"
                ></p>
<p>Step 12</p>
<p>After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animation tab filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add<strong>” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “</strong>+Add<strong>” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “</strong>+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/keyframe.png"
                      alt="add keyframe filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the <strong>Scale</strong> and the <strong>Position values</strong> as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.</p>
<p>For the <strong>second keyframe</strong>, just increase the <strong>Scale</strong> and adjust the <strong>Position</strong> value based on how it looks on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="circle position"
                ></p>
<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Now, apply the same method as in <strong>Step 14</strong> to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="keyframe positions"
                ></p>
<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, <strong>Enable</strong> the <strong>Outline</strong> option and <strong>Disable</strong> the <strong>Fill</strong> option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="outline settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 17</p>
<p>Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.</p>

<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Transitions</strong> tab <strong>→</strong> search for “<strong>Push</strong>” <strong>→</strong> drag the Push transition to the Default Title in the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag another Default Title to that point from the <strong>Titles</strong> tab.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the new Default Title <strong>→</strong> go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Delete the default text and add a <strong>Circle</strong> shape this time instead of a Rectangle. Disable the <strong>Text Fill and Shape Fill</strong> options this time.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Scroll down to <strong>Shape Border</strong> and increase the <strong>Thickness</strong> bar all the way up. Then, change the circle’s color to match your background as closely as possible. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Copy the Title you just edited and paste it into the above layer. Then, double-click on the copied Title and go to its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy.png"
                      alt="copy title"
                ></p>
<p>Step 11</p>
<p>In the Advanced panel, copy the circle and paste it somewhere else on the screen. Change its size if you want, and change the shade of its color to match the background once more. You can add as many new copies of the Default Titles and copy as many circles as you want. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add more circles"
                ></p>
<p>Step 12</p>
<p>After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animation tab filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add<strong>” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “</strong>+Add<strong>” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “</strong>+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframe filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the <strong>Scale</strong> and the <strong>Position values</strong> as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.</p>
<p>For the <strong>second keyframe</strong>, just increase the <strong>Scale</strong> and adjust the <strong>Position</strong> value based on how it looks on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="circle position"
                ></p>
<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Now, apply the same method as in <strong>Step 14</strong> to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="keyframe positions"
                ></p>
<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, <strong>Enable</strong> the <strong>Outline</strong> option and <strong>Disable</strong> the <strong>Fill</strong> option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 17</p>
<p>Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 18</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the <strong>“Type Writer”</strong> animation. Then, drag the yellow lines below just like you see in the image here. The arrows show you the length to which you need to drag these lines. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="type writer animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 19</p>
<p>Set the Playhead to 1 second and 40 frames. Now, double-click on the last Default Title we just created and go to its <strong>Animation settings. NOTE:</strong> Don’t open its Advanced settings this time. Next, add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead near the end of this clip in the Timeline. Now, drag the X position to the left until you see the last letter of your text appear on the screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 20</p>
<p>Now, add another Default Title to the Timeline. Open its Advanced settings and type in your main text. Then, go to its <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the “Random 2” animation. Change its starting and end times according to your preference. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Transitions</strong> tab <strong>→</strong> search for “<strong>Push</strong>” <strong>→</strong> drag the Push transition to the Default Title in the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag another Default Title to that point from the <strong>Titles</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="push transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the new Default Title <strong>→</strong> go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Delete the default text and add a <strong>Circle</strong> shape this time instead of a Rectangle. Disable the <strong>Text Fill and Shape Fill</strong> options this time.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Scroll down to <strong>Shape Border</strong> and increase the <strong>Thickness</strong> bar all the way up. Then, change the circle’s color to match your background as closely as possible. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="shape border filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Copy the Title you just edited and paste it into the above layer. Then, double-click on the copied Title and go to its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy.png"
                      alt="copy title"
                ></p>
<p>Step 11</p>
<p>In the Advanced panel, copy the circle and paste it somewhere else on the screen. Change its size if you want, and change the shade of its color to match the background once more. You can add as many new copies of the Default Titles and copy as many circles as you want. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add more circles"
                ></p>
<p>Step 12</p>
<p>After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="animation tab filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add<strong>” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “</strong>+Add<strong>” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “</strong>+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.</p>

                      alt="add keyframe filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the <strong>Scale</strong> and the <strong>Position values</strong> as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.</p>
<p>For the <strong>second keyframe</strong>, just increase the <strong>Scale</strong> and adjust the <strong>Position</strong> value based on how it looks on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="circle position"
                ></p>
<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Now, apply the same method as in <strong>Step 14</strong> to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, <strong>Enable</strong> the <strong>Outline</strong> option and <strong>Disable</strong> the <strong>Fill</strong> option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.</p>

<p>Step 18</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the <strong>“Type Writer”</strong> animation. Then, drag the yellow lines below just like you see in the image here. The arrows show you the length to which you need to drag these lines. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/type-writer.png"
                      alt="type writer animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 19</p>
<p>Set the Playhead to 1 second and 40 frames. Now, double-click on the last Default Title we just created and go to its <strong>Animation settings. NOTE:</strong> Don’t open its Advanced settings this time. Next, add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead near the end of this clip in the Timeline. Now, drag the X position to the left until you see the last letter of your text appear on the screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/x-position.png"
                      alt="text animation settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 20</p>
<p>Now, add another Default Title to the Timeline. Open its Advanced settings and type in your main text. Then, go to its <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the “Random 2” animation. Change its starting and end times according to your preference. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/random.png"

                ></p>

            <h2 id="Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video"></a>Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg"
                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg"
                      alt="obs customize the recording source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording.

What Is A Freeze Frame?</h2><p>A freeze frame is a specific single frame of the video clip shown repeatedly in the video. It gives the illusion of a static picture. It is used to draw the viewers’ attention to the minute details of a specific moment, to set up a powerful narrative, or to introduce your main characters.</p>

<h5 id="Step4-Find-your-first-action-frame-1"><a href="#Step4-Find-your-first-action-frame-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Find your first action frame"></a>Step4 Find your first action frame</h5><p>Next, scrub through the clip to find your first action frame. <strong>For example,</strong> in this video, this is our first action frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the first action frame"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step5-Take-a-screenshot-of-the-action-frame-1"><a href="#Step5-Take-a-screenshot-of-the-action-frame-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Take a screenshot of the action frame"></a>Step5 Take a screenshot of the action frame</h5><p>Let’s head to the camera icon under the preview screen and click the icon. It will take a screenshot of the current frame that the playhead is on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-9.gif"
                      alt="take a screenshot of the action frame"
                ></p>
<p>Make sure to keep the playhead the same after you’ve taken the snapshot. You can find your screenshot in the media tab.</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-the-screenshot-to-timeline-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-the-screenshot-to-timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline"></a>Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline</h5><p>Let’s drag your screenshot onto video layer 2 and align it on the right side of the playhead. Then extend the screenshot so it lasts as long as your central clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step7-Apply-masks-to-the-screenshot-1"><a href="#Step7-Apply-masks-to-the-screenshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Apply masks to the screenshot"></a>Step7 Apply masks to the screenshot</h5><p>Now, double-click on the screenshot. It will open the “Video” menu, then go into the “Mask” menu. Choose a mask shape and edit it so that it only covers where your subject is in the screenshot. <strong>For example,</strong> we choose the **”**Circle” mask shape in this video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose your mask shape"
                ></p>
<p>If you need help seeing what you’re masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hide the main video layer"
                ></p>
<p>Move the playhead forward and clean up your “mask.” Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<ul>
<li>Double-click to mask this frame.</li>

                      alt="crossing over should be avoided"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Why is it necessary to avoid crossing the same spot?</strong></p>

<li>It helps to create an illusion of holding specific moments.</li>

One of the most professional effects is the reverse video effect. This unique effect is always challenging for the makers to shoot and portray on the screen flawlessly.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is intriguing and always draws the audience’s attention. In this article, you will learn to shoot and edit the video for reverse effects using Filmora. But first, we will learn what does video reverse effect mean. So let us get into this!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Video-Reverse-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Video-Reverse-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Video Reverse Effect?"></a>Part 1. What Is Video Reverse Effect?</h2><p>It is a special video effect in which a motion of things starts in the backward direction. This unique effect is used to intrigue the audience.</p>
<p>For example, if a bullet is fired from a gun. With the reverse effect, you can rewind the footage, and the shot goes back into the gun. So today, you can easily rewind fast action scenes and get a wow reaction from the audience.</p>
<h3 id="Famous-Examples-of-Reverse-Effect-in-Films"><a href="#Famous-Examples-of-Reverse-Effect-in-Films" class="headerlink" title="Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films"></a>Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films</h3><p><strong>1- Demolition of a Wall (1896)</strong></p>
<p>Filmmakers first used this striking effect in 1896 in a 90 seconds film, “Demolition of a wall.” Louis Lumiere was the one who made that video. Below is shown an image from the film.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>2- Tenet (2020)</strong></p>
<p>It is a viral film by Christopher Nolan, which was a great success. He explained the concept of reverse entropy, in which you start moving back chronologically in time instead of forward. This concept is all shown through this special video reverse effect. Unfortunately, the audience had difficulty digesting this unique concept, which generated an awful response.</p>

How To Shoot Video Reverse Effect?</h2><p>The reverse effect is unique, so special attention should be paid while filming a video. This section will cover some of the crucial prerequisites to film a video.</p>
<h3 id="Steady-Camera"><a href="#Steady-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Steady Camera"></a>Steady Camera</h3><p>It would be best to have your camera placed on a steady surface or mounted on a tripod stand to lock the focus. We will split the area and perform different tasks to make it look smooth. The audience will not get the idea that you completed the tasks separately. And it helps in the editing process as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h3 id="A-Spacious-Area"><a href="#A-Spacious-Area" class="headerlink" title="A Spacious Area"></a>A Spacious Area</h3><p>You will need a spacious area in which you will perform different tasks. Make sure your camera stands still while shooting all the frames of video. In an ample space, it becomes easier to do movements freely. It also helps prevent glitches in the final product.</p>
<h3 id="Splitting-of-Area-into-Portions"><a href="#Splitting-of-Area-into-Portions" class="headerlink" title="Splitting of Area into Portions"></a>Splitting of Area into Portions</h3><p>Now you have to split your area into portions. Each task is in its part of the frame, and actions in one frame should not pass over into another. You will do one activity per portion. It makes the editing process a lot easier. Finally, we get all three videos to merge and make it look like a single video.</p>

<h2 id="How-To-Create-A-Green-Screen-Video-In-After-Effects"><a href="#How-To-Create-A-Green-Screen-Video-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects"></a>How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects</h2><p>You’ll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We’ll demonstrate how to do easily for you.</p>
<p>Let’s start off!</p>
<h2 id="1-Importing-your-footage"><a href="#1-Importing-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Importing your footage"></a>1. Importing your footage</h2><p>After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the “Image Utilities” heading.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import green screen video footage ae"
                ></p>
<h2 id="2-Remove-the-green-color"><a href="#2-Remove-the-green-color" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove the green color"></a>2. Remove the green color</h2><p>After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the “Animation Presets” window, searching for the “Keylight” preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the “Effects Controls” window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen’s background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="remove green color from video in ae"
                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Clean-up-the-shot"><a href="#3-Clean-up-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="3. Clean up the shot"></a>3. Clean up the shot</h2><p>You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.</p>
<p>Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg"
                      alt="clean up green screen shot ae"
                ></p>
<p>You can go to the “Screen Matte” area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you’ve applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs<img

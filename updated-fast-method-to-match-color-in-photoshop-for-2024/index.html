Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg"
                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg"
                      alt="match color source"
                ></p>
<p>Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the “Layer” option of Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 Select the correct options in the “Image Statistics” area</strong></p>
<p>In the “Image Statistics” portion, you will find some options, such as “Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours” and “Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment”. You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match color"
                ></p>
<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose levels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9 Adjust the Pointers</strong></p>
<p>You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.</p>
<p>Then click on “OK” and exit the box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-8.jpg"
                      alt="level adjustment layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10 Select “Luminosity”</strong></p>
<p>You will find the “Blend Mode” in the “Layers palette”. Select the “Blend Mode” from there. You will find it reflecting “Normal”, which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from “Normal” to “Luminosity”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-9.jpg"
                      alt="luminosity blend mode"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11 Deselect</strong></p>
<p>Now, use the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl+D” if you are using windows and “Command+D” working on a Mac device. And this completes the entire process of colour matching in photoshop.</p>

Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match color source"
                ></p>
<p>Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the “Layer” option of Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 Select the correct options in the “Image Statistics” area</strong></p>
<p>In the “Image Statistics” portion, you will find some options, such as “Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours” and “Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment”. You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.</p>

                      alt="match color"
                ></p>
<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="choose levels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9 Adjust the Pointers</strong></p>
<p>You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.</p>
<p>Then click on “OK” and exit the box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="level adjustment layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10 Select “Luminosity”</strong></p>
<p>You will find the “Blend Mode” in the “Layers palette”. Select the “Blend Mode” from there. You will find it reflecting “Normal”, which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from “Normal” to “Luminosity”.</p>

Next, place the camera on a tripod, and tilt down to show the table from the top.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size.

<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Brake:</strong> It is another popular video converter that can convert a .flv file into almost any file format.</p>
<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

<p>It has 3 different plans depending on your needs. The first one is the “Free Plan” which is almost useless for most users as it creates a watermark. The second one is the “Basic Plan” at 18$&#x2F;month. While third is the “Pro Plan” at 30$&#x2F;month which has some more features than the basic plan. You can purchase an annual plan to save up to 33%.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I choose Free or Paid FLV Editor</strong> <strong>:</strong></p>
<p> Are you confused to choose the FLV editor for you? Then look for the one that suits your other needs.

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

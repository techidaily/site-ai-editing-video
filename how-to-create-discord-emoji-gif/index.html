<p>● You can talk about gaming</p>
<p>● The other can be useful to talk about sports activities, etc.</p>

There is also a position of an administrator, in which they can assign roles to each person, which comes with special privileges and name tags. These roles may benefit various large groups and provide a moderation sense in the server.</p>
<p>Not only does Discord offer group chats, but it also offers a non-public chatting feature which is also available. This allows users to talk one-on-one with other users and turn out to be friends with one another.</p>

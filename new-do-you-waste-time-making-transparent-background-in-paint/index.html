Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there.

<p>Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.</p>
<p>After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background"><a href="#Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Make the lower third background"></a>Step1 Make the lower third background</h5><p>Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.</p>

<h5 id="Step3-Add-some-text"><a href="#Step3-Add-some-text" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add some text"></a>Step3 Add some text</h5><p>Once the background card is in place, go to Titles &gt; Plain Text &gt; ‘Basic 6’ and drop it onto the third video track.</p>

<p>Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>

<h2 id="Wrapping-up"><a href="#Wrapping-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping up"></a>Wrapping up</h2><p>These are two ways you can create your own Lower Thirds in FIlmora.

<p>These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.</p>

Also, make sure it’s close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.</p>

<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background-1"><a href="#Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Make the lower third background"></a>Step1 Make the lower third background</h5><p>Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.</p>

<h5 id="Step3-Add-some-text-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-some-text-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add some text"></a>Step3 Add some text</h5><p>Once the background card is in place, go to Titles &gt; Plain Text &gt; ‘Basic 6’ and drop it onto the third video track.</p>

<p>Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.</p>

<p>Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>

<h3 id="Custom-Picture-in-Picture-Paths"><a href="#Custom-Picture-in-Picture-Paths" class="headerlink" title="Custom Picture-in-Picture Paths"></a>Custom Picture-in-Picture Paths</h3><p>We use the picture-in-picture effect in many editing formats, from tutorial videos to gaming streams and vlogs. Keyframing allows editors to execute the movement of the PIP as they wish. For instance, this video call was shot from a video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>The picture will move across the screen between the 30-second and 1-minute marks if you indicate that it will be in the upper left corner of the screen at the 30-second timestamp of your video and the bottom right corner at the 1-minute timestamp.</p>

<p>The high-resolution requirement is a prerequisite for the complete experience of all parameters of the keyframe feature. For example, the zooming and varying opacity effects you add might look bland and dull if the clip or image appears pixelated upon zooming and scaling.</p>
<h3 id="2-Motion-Elements"><a href="#2-Motion-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Motion Elements"></a>2.

<h2 id="How-to-Loop-a-Video-on-Vimeo"><a href="#How-to-Loop-a-Video-on-Vimeo" class="headerlink" title="How to Loop a Video on Vimeo?"></a>How to Loop a Video on Vimeo?</h2><p>Vimeo is a popular video streaming platform where you can watch videos all day. Vimeo is a close competitor of YouTube. If you are a regular viewer on Vimeo, you may want to watch a video in a loop. Instead of manually playing the video again and again, you can automatically loop the video on Vimeo.</p>
<p>If you are embedding a Vimeo video on your website, you will want to play it on a loop. This will ensure maximum watch time from the audience. Besides, if you are a video creator, you may want to loop Vimeo videos for your video project. We will illustrate how to loop video on Vimeo for all scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="Way-1-Loop-A-Video-on-Vimeo-Directly"><a href="#Way-1-Loop-A-Video-on-Vimeo-Directly" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Loop A Video on Vimeo Directly"></a>Way 1. Loop A Video on Vimeo Directly</h2><p>Most online users watch videos on Vimeo directly through the web browser. This is specifically applicable to computer users. If you want Vimeo loop video for any desired video, the steps are simple. You have to make some adjustments and additions to the video URL on the address bar. You should change the URL accurately for looping a video. Here are the steps on how to loop a video on Vimeo directly.</p>
<p>Step 1: On your device, launch the web browser. Open the official website of Vimeo Watch. Play any video of your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-vimeo-watch.jpg"
                      alt="play video vimeo watch"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Now, you need to change the URL of the video you are playing. Here are the changes to make in the address bar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove everything at the beginning of “vimeo.com”. Add “.player” at the beginning of the URL.</li>
<li>Add “&#x2F;video&#x2F;“ after “vimeo.com”.</li>
<li>Add “?amp;loop&#x3D;1:” at the end of the URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the initial URL of the video was “<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/754255543" >https://vimeo.com/754255543 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“. You have to change it to “player.vimeo.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;754255543?amp;loop&#x3D;1”.</p>
<p>Step 3: After making the changes, press Enter key. The same video will play in a loop until you pause the video or close the web browser’s tab.</p>

Loop a Vimeo Video When Embedded on Your Site"></a>Way 2. Loop a Vimeo Video When Embedded on Your Site</h2><p>You can embed a Vimeo video on your website so that the audience can watch it. The video will play only once when someone lands on your website. After the video ends playing, the embedding will show suggested videos. If you want the same video to play again and again, you have to put it in a loop. Here are the steps on how to loop Vimeo video when embedded on your website.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the Vimeo video on your web browser. Click on Share icon present inside the player in the top-right corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="get embed code vimeo"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: On the next screen, you will get the embed code in a pop-up box. Click on Show options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="show options share vimeo video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: From the expanded section, go to Special Stuff section. Turn on “Loop this video” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.</p>
<p>Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.</p>
<p>You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Whip-Your-Camera"><a href="#Whip-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Whip Your Camera"></a>Whip Your Camera</h2><p>You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a stepwise guide for you to try</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.</li>
<li>Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.</li>
<li>For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.</li>
<li>Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.</li>
<li>Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.</p>
<p>The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="whip your camera"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Fill-The-Frame"><a href="#Fill-The-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill The Frame"></a>Fill The Frame</h2><p>In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.</p>
<p>Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan the two shots you are going to take.</li>
<li>Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.</li>
<li>In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.</li>
<li>The second shot will take place at another time or place.</li>
<li>To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.</li>
<li>Import both shots into <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.</li>

<p>One important thing is to match the color and brightness of the object or subject. It will provide you with much better results. The video attached below explains all the steps of filling the frame.</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="Match-Cut"><a href="#Match-Cut" class="headerlink" title="Match Cut"></a>Match Cut</h2><p>In a video, a match cut transitions from one shot to another. During this, the composition of the two shots is matched by action, subject, and subject matter. The goal is to make a visual match between two situations that don’t have a direct link. Here are the steps to creating a match-cut transition in your videos.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan the shot you are going to take.</li>
<li>Record the action in the first shot, for example, clapping your hands.</li>
<li>Go to another place or scene to record the second shot.</li>
<li>Repeat the same action in the second shot.</li>
<li>Import both camera shots to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Cut one shot to another when the action is at its peak.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, you can smoothly transition from one place or scene to another. There is a video attached below for a better understanding of the steps.</p>

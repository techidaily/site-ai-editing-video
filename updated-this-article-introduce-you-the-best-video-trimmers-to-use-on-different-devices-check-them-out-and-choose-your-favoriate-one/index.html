<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>

Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration.

Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

You have two options when it comes to making a video. You can either record a video with recording software or you can shoot a video with your camera. Let us discuss both options in detail now.</p>
<p><strong>-Record a video</strong></p>
<p>You can record a video with recording software when you are capturing video from your webcam or from your computer screen. There are two options you have when it comes to choose a recording software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium Recorder - A premium recorder is a professional video recording software that you have to purchase to avail all the features and functionalities. Choose the best video recorder.</li>
<li>Free Recorder - If you are not willing to spend any money on a recording software, there are plenty of free recording applications available. We recommend <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the best free video recorder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-Shoot a video</strong></p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>

Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

Here, we can make the structure of Subscribe channel graphics using different colors, icons, texts, and channel photos. We’ll start by adding color layers.</p>
<p><strong>1. Add color layers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the “Media” on the top left corner of the interface and Click on “Sample Color.” Here find the Green color and add it in the panel below as the first video layer by the drag-n-drop function.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding a bright green color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will key this layer at the end, so make sure not to use any other green graphics for your animation.</li>
<li>Let’s lock this layer because we will no longer use it. For this, click on the “Lock” icon on the layer’s left side.</li>
<li>Add white and red colors and stack them on top of the green color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-4.png"
                      alt="white and red color layers added"
                ></p>
<p>After adding all three color layers, it’s time to crop these layers to make the structure of our graphic.</p>
<h5 id="Crop-the-Color-Layers"><a href="#Crop-the-Color-Layers" class="headerlink" title="Crop the Color Layers"></a><strong>Crop the Color Layers</strong></h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Effects” tab from the top bar and search for the “Crop” effect. Then drag the effect and add it to the white and red layers on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding the crop effect on color layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the “Eye” icon beside the red color layer to hide it. Then double-click the white layer to see its properties. When the properties appear, select “Effects” from there.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="cropping the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also enable the safe zones from the display settings on the right side of the panel. After that, crop the white layer first, then show the red layer and crop it too. It will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>That’s it, folks. Our color backgrounds are here. Now we have to add our channel photo to this. So let’s move on to see how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Add a channel photo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To add the channel photo, you can upload the image. Here we are going to use some images from the stock media. No matter the image, drop it down on the panel above the red color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding an image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click on the image layer, and from the properties, go to the “Mask” option and select the circle. You can also select any other shape you like.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select a shape for our image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After that, scroll down and make the circle even by matching all numbers. Then scale it down and place it on the left corner of the white layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-10.png"
                      alt="adjusting the channel image"
                ></p>
<p>It’s done. Let’s add our channel text now.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Add texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For adding text, go to the “Titles” from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-12.png"
                      alt="editing the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, let’s add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="subscribe button text added"
                ></p>
<p>We can’t finish our structure without icons, can we? So let’s move on to them.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Add icons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the “Element” from the top bar and search for the “Bell” icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="adding a bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the “Subscribe” text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<p>Finally, our structure is finished. Now let’s start animating.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Animate-the-graphics"><a href="#Step3-Animate-the-graphics" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Animate the graphics"></a>Step3 Animate the graphics</h5><p>First, we’ll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the “Animation” option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking “Add.” Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="adding a new keyframe on the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="successfully animated the graphics"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let’s correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the” Type Writer’ form and hit the “Advanced option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="selecting type writer style for text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Here, you can adjust the text with the color layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjusting the speed of the text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="the speed of the text adjusted"
                ></p>
<p>If you’ve managed so far, then that’s great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let’s see it in detail.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor"><a href="#Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Animate the mouse cursor"></a>Step4 Animate the mouse cursor</h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Mouse Cursor” icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the “Thumbs Up” so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the subscribe button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png"
                      alt="adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the “Bell” icon.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mouse curson on the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The last keyframe we have to add will place this “Mouse Cursor” icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving “Mouse Cursor’ icon according to your taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final product up till now will be like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let’s dive right into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the graphics out"></a>Step5 Animate the graphics out</h5><p>The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here’s how it’s done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.</li>
<li>Now, from the “Animation” option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.</li>
<li>After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="removed the white color layer from the frame"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.</li>
<li>After it’s done, the whole graphics will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animated the color, image, and icons layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the “Advanced” settings, just like before.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on the advanced option"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it’s done, we will do the same for the “Subscribe” button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the text with your graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our graphic is completed. “Export” it from the software to your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="completed subscribe channel graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the “Green Screen” option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that’s all.</p>

Here, we can make the structure of Subscribe channel graphics using different colors, icons, texts, and channel photos. We’ll start by adding color layers.</p>
<p><strong>1. Add color layers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the “Media” on the top left corner of the interface and Click on “Sample Color.” Here find the Green color and add it in the panel below as the first video layer by the drag-n-drop function.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding a bright green color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will key this layer at the end, so make sure not to use any other green graphics for your animation.</li>
<li>Let’s lock this layer because we will no longer use it. For this, click on the “Lock” icon on the layer’s left side.</li>
<li>Add white and red colors and stack them on top of the green color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-4.png"
                      alt="white and red color layers added"
                ></p>
<p>After adding all three color layers, it’s time to crop these layers to make the structure of our graphic.</p>
<h5 id="Crop-the-Color-Layers-1"><a href="#Crop-the-Color-Layers-1" class="headerlink" title="Crop the Color Layers"></a><strong>Crop the Color Layers</strong></h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Effects” tab from the top bar and search for the “Crop” effect. Then drag the effect and add it to the white and red layers on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding the crop effect on color layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the “Eye” icon beside the red color layer to hide it. Then double-click the white layer to see its properties. When the properties appear, select “Effects” from there.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cropping the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also enable the safe zones from the display settings on the right side of the panel. After that, crop the white layer first, then show the red layer and crop it too. It will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-7.png"
                      alt="enabling the safe zones"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it, folks. Our color backgrounds are here. Now we have to add our channel photo to this. So let’s move on to see how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Add a channel photo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To add the channel photo, you can upload the image. Here we are going to use some images from the stock media. No matter the image, drop it down on the panel above the red color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding an image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click on the image layer, and from the properties, go to the “Mask” option and select the circle. You can also select any other shape you like.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select a shape for our image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After that, scroll down and make the circle even by matching all numbers. Then scale it down and place it on the left corner of the white layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-10.png"
                      alt="adjusting the channel image"
                ></p>
<p>It’s done. Let’s add our channel text now.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Add texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For adding text, go to the “Titles” from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-12.png"
                      alt="editing the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, let’s add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="subscribe button text added"
                ></p>
<p>We can’t finish our structure without icons, can we? So let’s move on to them.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Add icons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the “Element” from the top bar and search for the “Bell” icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding a bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding a freezeframe of the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the “Subscribe” text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adjust the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, add “Thumbs Up” and “Mouse Cursor” icons on the panel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, our structure is finished. Now let’s start animating.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Animate-the-graphics-1"><a href="#Step3-Animate-the-graphics-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Animate the graphics"></a>Step3 Animate the graphics</h5><p>First, we’ll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the “Animation” option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking “Add.” Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="successfully animated the graphics"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let’s correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the” Type Writer’ form and hit the “Advanced option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>If you’ve managed so far, then that’s great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let’s see it in detail.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor-1"><a href="#Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Animate the mouse cursor"></a>Step4 Animate the mouse cursor</h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Mouse Cursor” icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the “Thumbs Up” so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the subscribe button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the “Bell” icon.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="mouse curson on the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The last keyframe we have to add will place this “Mouse Cursor” icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving “Mouse Cursor’ icon according to your taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final product up till now will be like this.</p>

                ></p>
<p>We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let’s dive right into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out-1"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the graphics out"></a>Step5 Animate the graphics out</h5><p>The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here’s how it’s done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.</li>
<li>Now, from the “Animation” option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.</li>
<li>After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="removed the white color layer from the frame"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.</li>
<li>After it’s done, the whole graphics will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="animated the color, image, and icons layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the “Advanced” settings, just like before.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="click on the advanced option"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it’s done, we will do the same for the “Subscribe” button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="adjust the text with your graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our graphic is completed. “Export” it from the software to your computer.</p>

<p>Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the “Green Screen” option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that’s all.</p>

Starting from social media videos to short films and movies, Final Cut Pro is a popular choice. Even though video editing using FCP is mostly done on Mac, there are many who prefer video editing on their powerful phones. It is quite shocking that Final Cut Pro for Android and iOS users is not yet available.</p>
<p>Since it is an Apple-exclusive application, you would have expected FCP mobile app for iPhone and iPad. But Apple is yet to develop a mobile app for Final Cut Pro. Naturally, we have to look for Final Cut Pro alternative mobile apps for smartphone users. The alternatives need to be as feature-rich and powerful as FCP. Here is the list of the best Final Cut Pro alternative apps for Android and iOS users.</p>

<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>These steps will help you to know how to edit video with Filmora software;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start a new project.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png"
                      alt="filmora start new project"
                ></p>
<p>After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import your media</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"
                      alt="filmora import media"
                ></p>
<p>The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the <em>‘File &gt; Import Media Folder’</em> menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.</p>
<p>After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.</p>
<p>These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add clips to the timeline, trim, adjust appropriately and sequence them.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"
                      alt="filmora split video"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.</p>
<p>Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.</p>
<p>After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.</p>
<p>If you want to split a clip in the timeline, pick the scissors by clicking on the ‘_Scissors_’ icon.</p>
<p>When working on your video footage, click the spacebar of your computer keyboard to preview. By doing this, you will be able to see how your clips are joined together.</p>
<p>Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filmora add transitions"
                ></p>
<p>Click on the Effect icon at the top of the app and a deep visual library of effects will be visible. If you want to add a certain effect to your active clip, just double-click it.</p>
<p>Add transitions in your video timeline to cut the scene-to-scene. They are quite necessary as they help establish your audience’s attention.</p>
<p>The next thing after adding the transmissions will be adding the overlays and exporting your video by clicking on the ‘<em>Export</em>‘ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Export your finished video.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/export-to-local-win-1.png"
                      alt="filmora export video"
                ></p>
<p>You can click the ‘Export’ button and switch to the platform you want your video to be exported.</p>

<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

It contains cool features to help you capture and edit your videos and audios appropriately.</p>

                      alt="camtasia"
                ></p>
<p>Here are some pros and cons of Camtasia.</p>

</ul>
<p>Here are key steps to follow when editing a video with Camtasia.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Break up steps of a process with lower thirds.</p>
<p>Break any long multi-step video to help lower the viewer’s cognitive load.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Reinforce texts with video.</p>
<p>Remove any mistakes and extra content such as unnecessary footage from the ends of your recording. If you trim too much drag the clip back to restore. This process is known as trimming.</p>
<p>You can zoom in on the most important section to focus your viewer’s attention there.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add narrative to video</p>
<h2 id="Alternative-Way-to-Edit-Videos-3"><a href="#Alternative-Way-to-Edit-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Alternative Way to Edit Videos"></a>Alternative Way to Edit Videos</h2><p>Getting an appropriate video editing software is quite challenging as the makers of these software sometimes get confused about if the programs needed are for home videos or professional-quality work such as Hollywood movies.

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>These steps will help you to know how to edit video with Filmora software;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start a new project.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png"
                      alt="filmora start new project"
                ></p>
<p>After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import your media</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"
                      alt="filmora import media"
                ></p>
<p>The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the <em>‘File &gt; Import Media Folder’</em> menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.</p>
<p>After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.</p>
<p>These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add clips to the timeline, trim, adjust appropriately and sequence them.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"
                      alt="filmora split video"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.</p>
<p>Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.</p>
<p>After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.</p>
<p>If you want to split a clip in the timeline, pick the scissors by clicking on the ‘_Scissors_’ icon.</p>
<p>When working on your video footage, click the spacebar of your computer keyboard to preview. By doing this, you will be able to see how your clips are joined together.</p>
<p>Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/modify-transitions-win-4.jpg"
                      alt="filmora add transitions"
                ></p>
<p>Click on the Effect icon at the top of the app and a deep visual library of effects will be visible. If you want to add a certain effect to your active clip, just double-click it.</p>
<p>Add transitions in your video timeline to cut the scene-to-scene. They are quite necessary as they help establish your audience’s attention.</p>
<p>The next thing after adding the transmissions will be adding the overlays and exporting your video by clicking on the ‘<em>Export</em>‘ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Export your finished video.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/export-to-local-win-1.png"
                      alt="filmora export video"
                ></p>
<p>You can click the ‘Export’ button and switch to the platform you want your video to be exported.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Choosing an appropriate video editing tool is equally as important as the video itself. And with the availability of so many of these video editing tools, choosing among them is quite hard. You can easily get confused especially if you are a beginner in the video editing industry. To avoid the complications you need to know what editing software is the best for your project.</p>

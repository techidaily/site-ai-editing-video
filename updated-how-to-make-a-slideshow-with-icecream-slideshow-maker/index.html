<p><strong>Step 5: Add a Desired Background Music</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Icecream Slideshow maker pro</strong> allows you to include a background music track within your presentation. For working towards the inclusion process, you will have to import the desired audio files to the program’s editor timeline. The software works well with the WAV, WMA, FLAC, M4A, MP3 and OGG audio file formats. Navigate to and hit the ‘Add Audio’ button in the editor workspace to ‘Drag and Drop’ the desired music files within the software’s timeline.</p>
<p>There is an option to create a playlist of the selected audio tracks, along with dragging the files to set them in a preferred sequence within the playlist. You are also granted the liberty to try hands at looping the audio playback and uplift the tracks with fade and offset effects within the playlist pane.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Tweak Some Extra Settings</strong></p>
<p>If you are keen towards making your presentation more impressive, try experimenting with including transition effects within the slides. Though the <strong>Icecream slideshow maker full version</strong> supports the application of default random transitions, you are allowed to add and customize the same as per your will, both, separately for each slide, as well as to the entre presentation as a whole.</p>
<p>You can even choose to add no transition effect at all, or set the same transition value for all the media files within the queue, by navigating to and clicking on the ‘Common Image Settings in the ’File Queue’ window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Output Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Set a preferable output resolution to generate a premium quality slideshow presentation. To do this, navigate to the bottom left corner of the ‘Preview’ window at the right side of the editor workspace and choose a desired resolution for the slideshow from a range of values, such as, 1280 x 1024, 2560 x 1440, 1920 x 1080, etc., in the ‘Resolution’ tab.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> <strong>Format Selection</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is, select a convenient output file format for your presentation. You can pick anyone from the available AVI, WebM, MP4, MOV file formats. To make your choice, navigate to the bottom of the ‘File Queue’ window at the left and click on the ‘File Format’ dropdown arrow at the right. A list of the output formats supported by the program appears next, and you are free to pick the one you like.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Create Your Icecream Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>When you have finalized all the arrangements and settings, navigate to and hit the ‘Preview’ button at the bottom right corner of the ‘Preview’ window to initiate a mock run of your slideshow in the software’s inbuilt slideshow player. If everything seems fine, proceed to start the slideshow creation process by clicking on the ‘Create’ button.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The process may require you to wait for a few moments before the final presentation output is generated. Nonetheless, you can always keep a track of the creation process through the elapsed and remaining duration in the ‘Progress Bar’ at the bottom of the program’s editing workspace. A completion prompt will pop up as soon as the slideshow is ready.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds"><a href="#2-Clouds" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky"><a href="#3-Starry-sky" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers"><a href="#4-Flowers" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing"><a href="#5-Season-changing" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects"><a href="#8-DIY-projects" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>
<h4 id="6-Import-and-stitch-together"><a href="#6-Import-and-stitch-together" class="headerlink" title="6. Import and stitch together"></a>6. Import and stitch together</h4><p>Once you’ve captured the images, import them into a video editing software, stitch them together, and perform necessary editing.</p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="drag the media file to the timeline"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Speed</strong> icon and select the <strong>Fast</strong> option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-1"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-1"><a href="#2-Clouds-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-1"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-1"><a href="#4-Flowers-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-1"><a href="#5-Season-changing-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-1"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-1"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-1"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-1" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-1"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-1"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-1" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-1"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-1"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-1"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-1"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-1"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-2"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-2"><a href="#2-Clouds-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-2"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-2"><a href="#4-Flowers-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-2"><a href="#5-Season-changing-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-2"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-2"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-2"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-2" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-2"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-2"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-2" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-2"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-2"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-2"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-2"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-2"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-3"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-3"><a href="#2-Clouds-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-3"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-3"><a href="#4-Flowers-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-3"><a href="#5-Season-changing-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-3"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-3"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-3"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-3" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-3"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-3"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-3" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-3"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-3"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-3"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-3"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-3"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>
<h4 id="6-Import-and-stitch-together-3"><a href="#6-Import-and-stitch-together-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Import and stitch together"></a>6.

<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Click the <strong>Speed</strong> icon and select the <strong>Fast</strong> option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

Too high of a frame rate makes the video seem unnatural. On the other hand, too low can make some videos choppy. You can fix that by changing the frame rate using a video editor. And we are here to help you learn how to do that. Here’s <strong>how to change the frame rate in Premiere Pro.</strong></p>
<p>The frame rate sometimes makes or breaks the video. So it is important to get this setting right. Suppose you made a mistake and recorded your video in the wrong setting. You can follow this guide to solve your problem.</p>

Maybe you don’t need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.</p>
<p>So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?</p>
<ol>
<li>Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Check the “Media” window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for “frames per second,” which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="check video frame rate in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Changing Frame Rate"></a>Reasons for Changing Frame Rate</h2><p>Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.</p>
<p>Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.</p>
<p>However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the “soap opera effect.” It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem “unnatural” or less cinematic.</p>
<p>High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That’s great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it’s also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.</p>
<p>With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video’s frame rate.</p>

Here’s a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.</p>

Only some parts need adjusting. You can change the frame rate of the sequences that need changing instead. Here are the steps to follow to achieve this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your project in Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.</li>
<li>Choose “Sequence Settings” from the menu that appears.</li>

If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You’d want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it’s a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That’s obviously not the number that we want. Don’t worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it’s super easy.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, “Drop media here to create sequence.”</li>

                ></p>
<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="GIFROCKET"><a href="#GIFROCKET" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Gifox</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>

<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<p>When you import your video, the app breaks it down into frames you can then work with, remove, or edit. You can also use images with the app and import them with the same type of editing options.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-9.jpg"

                ></p>
<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-1"><a href="#GIFROCKET-1" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>BEST PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC</strong></p>
<h3 id="PICGIF-1"><a href="#PICGIF-1" class="headerlink" title="PICGIF"></a><strong>PICGIF</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>
<h3 id="Features-1"><a href="#Features-1" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a><strong>Features:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Support a vast number of file formats</li>
<li>Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.</li>
<li>Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.</li>
<li>Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PicGIF software is safe to use</li>
<li>The support of PicGIF is good</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires OS X 10.7 Lion or later</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures-1"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen-1"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-20.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-21.jpg"

                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<h3 id="2-Flexible-Setting-1"><a href="#2-Flexible-Setting-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

<h3 id="3-Compress-1"><a href="#3-Compress-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Compress"></a>3. <strong>Compress</strong></h3><p>If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF. You can change the color count, the palette, the dither, and the bayer scale. This eliminates the need to install a second program just for compressing your file.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>
</li>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-2"><a href="#GIFROCKET-2" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures-2"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>What tip can I have in editing GIFs?</strong></li>

</ol>
<p>Absolutely, yes. Even without internet access, you can modify and quickly convert your GIF in no time.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>

<li>Intuitive interface</li>

<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>

When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures-3"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<h3 id="2-Flexible-Setting-3"><a href="#2-Flexible-Setting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Flexible Setting"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Flexible Setting</strong></h3><p>Gifox is not only easy to use but also a very flexible application. Here are just some of the options that you can customize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mouse cursor appearance</li>
<li>Window shadow</li>
<li>Desktop background recording fps</li>
<li>Playback fps</li>
<li>Repeat count and pause</li>
<li>Max colors</li>
<li>Bayer scale</li>

<h3 id="3-Compress-3"><a href="#3-Compress-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Compress"></a>3. <strong>Compress</strong></h3><p>If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF. You can change the color count, the palette, the dither, and the bayer scale. This eliminates the need to install a second program just for compressing your file.</p>
<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC?</strong></p>
<p>If the main reason you want this powerful and advanced GIF software is to create GIFs from videos, you should invest in the advanced version. Since there is not much you can do with videos and the free version.</p>
<p>However, if you want to make GIFs from photos, this free or open-source version will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT MAKING GIFS FROM VIDEO</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What tip can I have in editing GIFs?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t need to make your GIF colorful. You need to use fewer colors. The fewer colors your GIF has, the more fun it is. Because if your GIF has a lot of colors, you will have a problem exporting it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is it possible to export GIFs without watermarks?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, some GIF editors have a feature to remove the watermarks using a free account. However, there are also GIF editors where you need to pay a flat amount first before exporting GIF without watermarks.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can I use Video Converter Ultimate offline to edit a GIF?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Absolutely, yes. Even without internet access, you can modify and quickly convert your GIF in no time.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-9"><a href="#Conclusion-9" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2><p>If the proper GIF editor is used, animated GIFs can be edited with little effort. There are GIF software programs that are highly recommended by users due to their ease of use and simple interface. It’s time to give them a shot!</p>

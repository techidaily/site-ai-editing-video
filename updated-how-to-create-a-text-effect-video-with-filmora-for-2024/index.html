<h2 id="Part-1-Popular-text-effects-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-Popular-text-effects-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Popular text effects in Filmora"></a>Part 1. Popular text effects in Filmora</h2><p>There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="1-Text-Swipe-Effect"><a href="#1-Text-Swipe-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Text Swipe Effect"></a>1. Text Swipe Effect</h3><p>Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.</p>
<p>If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Type-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Type-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Type Text Effect"></a>2. Type Text Effect</h3><p>The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.</p>
<p>The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.</p>
<h3 id="3-WordArt-Effect"><a href="#3-WordArt-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. WordArt Effect"></a>3. WordArt Effect</h3><p>WordArt is synonymous with MS Word where large words have 3D effects and highlighted background. Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.</p>
<p>The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.</p>
<h3 id="4-Keyframe"><a href="#4-Keyframe" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyframe"></a>4. Keyframe</h3><p>If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.</p>
<p>If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="5-Color-Text-Effect"><a href="#5-Color-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Text Effect"></a>5. Color Text Effect</h3><p>The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits. Flashing different colors through your texts and titles against a darker background can act as a feast for the human eyes. There are different types of color text effects available that can make your text stand out.</p>
<p>When you are using color text effect, you need to maintain a large font size for your text so that it is widely visible. Even if your background is not dark, you can use a darker box in the background of the text or a darker frame around the text to amplify the effect.</p>
<h3 id="6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect"><a href="#6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect" class="headerlink" title="6. Bounce to Zoom Effect"></a>6. Bounce to Zoom Effect</h3><p>The bounce to zoom effect is widely used during a transition from one scene to another.

You can use the common and the popular video text effects as well as use unique text effects to make your video stand out easily. There is no better video editor to add text effects to your video other than <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for its unlimited text effect and animation templates.</p>
<p>Part 1. Popular text effects in Filmora</p>
<p>There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="1-Text-Swipe-Effect-1"><a href="#1-Text-Swipe-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Text Swipe Effect"></a>1. Text Swipe Effect</h3><p>Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.</p>
<p>If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Type-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#2-Type-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Type Text Effect"></a>2. Type Text Effect</h3><p>The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.</p>
<p>The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.</p>
<h3 id="3-WordArt-Effect-1"><a href="#3-WordArt-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="3. WordArt Effect"></a>3. WordArt Effect</h3><p>WordArt is synonymous with MS Word where large words have 3D effects and highlighted background. Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.</p>
<p>The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.</p>
<h3 id="4-Keyframe-1"><a href="#4-Keyframe-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyframe"></a>4. Keyframe</h3><p>If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.</p>
<p>If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="5-Color-Text-Effect-1"><a href="#5-Color-Text-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Text Effect"></a>5. Color Text Effect</h3><p>The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits. Flashing different colors through your texts and titles against a darker background can act as a feast for the human eyes. There are different types of color text effects available that can make your text stand out.</p>
<p>When you are using color text effect, you need to maintain a large font size for your text so that it is widely visible. Even if your background is not dark, you can use a darker box in the background of the text or a darker frame around the text to amplify the effect.</p>
<h3 id="6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect-1"><a href="#6-Bounce-to-Zoom-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Bounce to Zoom Effect"></a>6. Bounce to Zoom Effect</h3><p>The bounce to zoom effect is widely used during a transition from one scene to another. It is regarded as a funny text effect where the text can swipe in and bounce and enlarge in size. Alternatively, the characters can bounce individually and zoom in and out with the motion as if they are dancing.</p>
<p>Apart from transitions, you can use the bounce to zoom effect to showcase a few important texts at the bottom of the video so that the viewers notice your text. Generally, the effect lasts for a few seconds before the text disappears. When you are using it for a larger text, you can use it for promotions and advertisements as well.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don’t have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>

<h2 id="Best-Audio-Waveform-Generator"><a href="#Best-Audio-Waveform-Generator" class="headerlink" title="Best Audio Waveform Generator"></a>Best Audio Waveform Generator</h2><p>For more than a century, sound waves and broadcasts have played an important role in shaping media as we know it. Here’s how to implement them into your social media strategy. They have become popular in short video animations used to promote audio on social media, commonly referred to as audiograms.</p>
<p>Before learning everything there is to know about audiograms and how to make them, let’s gain a better understanding of the significance of these patterns.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-an-audio-waveform"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-an-audio-waveform" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is an audio waveform?"></a>Part 1. What is an audio waveform?</h2><p>A sound wave is the vibration of air molecules, which is how sound travels. The waveform describes the wave using a graph of how the air molecule is displaced over time.</p>
<p>Amplitude is the strength of a wave’s action; the higher the amplitude, the more the air molecules are displaced. This also translates into loudness for the human ear; increasing the amplitude of the wave will increase how loud it appears to us. Sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waveforms are the most typical periodic waveforms.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-audio-wave-animation"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-audio-wave-animation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is audio wave animation?"></a>Part 2. What is audio wave animation?</h2><p>A waveform animation video is a short video clip that can be uploaded to social media that combines an audio file with a static background image and a straightforward waveform animation. Audio animations, an example of audio visualization, make for fantastic video content, which is increasingly valuable on ever-noisy social media platforms.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Why-do-we-use-audio-visualization"><a href="#Part-3-Why-do-we-use-audio-visualization" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Why do we use audio visualization?"></a>Part 3. Why do we use audio visualization?</h2><p>We all know that there is a special way of feeling called synesthesia, which is both a psychological and a linguistic phenomenon. Similar to how you automatically link this rain scene with the sound of heavy rain when you see it. People’s newly awakened senses are more about the synthesis of sensory experience with actual life experience than they are entirely about actual information. Therefore, for clean audio, enhancing it with complementary visual animation effects will improve the user’s visual experience and, to some extent, offer additional information and impact to your audio.</p>

Best Audio Waveform Generator</h2><p>Audio visualization can be presented in a variety of ways. The simplest kind of processing involves taking low-dimensional information like frequency, loudness, and rhythm and converting them into images in the form of colors, forms, strokes, etc. However, modern artificial intelligence technology can now extract high-dimensional visual attributes including style, tone, and emotion. But, for most non-technical players, such processes are obviously out of their league, therefore your best choice is to use a basic audio waveform generator. Following, we’ll suggest 10 desktop or online generators so you may quickly finish the audio visualization project and create your audio-related videos.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>It has consistently been upgraded and improved since its inception when it was pretty great already.</li>
<li>The product is great based on how it was marketed, and it is a great tool. This is easily accomplished by use among three brands.</li>
<li>An excellent experience with a great community of entrepreneurs and marketers supporting the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t have a direct publication on Instagram but offers 2 ways: via app notification (which can be annoying at times) or integration with Zapier, through a wizard.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.renderforest.com/music-visualizer.html"><strong>Renderforest Music Visualizer</strong></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Renderforest is a platform that enables users to design whole websites or upload visual assets for online use. However, to start visualizing your music with Renderforest, you must first register and create your account. Then just choose between visualization templates with text or photo holders, add the artist’s name and track title, then add a background photo or video. You can proceed to choose a visualization style that perfectly matches the music, chooses its color, and finally uploads the song you want to use in your video. Once done, you should simply click on the Preview icon and Renderforest will send you an email containing a video of the music visualization. Keep in mind that all videos created using the free version of the platform will be watermarked and cannot exceed the one-minute limit.</p>

                      alt="renderforest music visualizer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version accessible; $9.99 is the starting price for subscriptions.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>It has got loads of beautiful templates to choose from, which could even fit perfectly into the kind of logo animation project you may have in mind.</li>
<li>The effortless, natural, effective, rational, and impressive way to share your amazing ideas with the world. Just let your imagination go wild and keep going.</li>
<li>A wide variety of templates and animations, with lots of customization available. And it offers amazing customer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>The only thing that is a downside is that there is a watermark by default, which can only be removed by paying.</li>
<li>It is fairly expensive for the lack of many features.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://videobolt.net/music-visualizer"><strong>Videobolt Music Visualizer</strong></a></li>
</ol>
<p>The collection of music visualization templates that this website offers is really impressive as you can choose from a wide variety of templates during the video creation process. However, you must purchase one of the available subscription plans to customize the template you’ve selected and export it without a watermark. After selecting a music visualization template, just click the Edit button below it and start working on your project. You can either upload a song from your computer or use SoundCloud to import the song you want to visualize into your project. You can improve the quality of your video by adding a cover or using a variation of the template you originally selected. The only downside is that you won’t be able to edit the videos produced by Videobolt Music Visualizer during the free trial period.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start from $7.99 per month</p>

<ul>
<li>The quality and ease to create awesome-looking intros have been an invaluable tool in my work. Simple to use with excellent assistance available.</li>
<li>This tool has helped me make an awesome-looking music video and an intro as well.</li>
<li>Particularly the quality of the final product and the ability to change the templates to compliment the client’s brand guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>The overall experience is poor, and their support is terrible.</li>
<li>As someone with not that much money to spend, it is a bit costly.</li>
<li>Sometimes it’s hard to find exactly what you need.</li>

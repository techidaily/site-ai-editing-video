<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?"></a>Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?</h2><p>Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.</p>
<p>Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.</p>
<p>Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it’s a challenge, it’s not impossible to accomplish.</p>
<p>And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:</p>
<h3 id="1-SOT-MOT"><a href="#1-SOT-MOT" class="headerlink" title="1. SOT &amp; MOT"></a>1. SOT &amp; MOT</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Single Object Tracking (SOT):</strong> SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and&#x2F;or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):</strong> MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection"><a href="#2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection" class="headerlink" title="2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection"></a>2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection</h3><p>After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.</p>
<p>The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking</h2><h3 id="Image-Tracking"><a href="#Image-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Image Tracking"></a>Image Tracking</h3><p>Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.</p>
<p>Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.</p>
<h3 id="Video-Tracking"><a href="#Video-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Video Tracking"></a>Video Tracking</h3><p>Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?"></a>Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?</h2><p>As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Background Clutter:</strong> The background can impact extracting an object’s features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Occlusion:</strong> This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Varying spatial scales:</strong> Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Tracking Speed:</strong> If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h2><p>After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.</p>
<h3 id="1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h3><p>Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:</p>
<p><strong>Target Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance Modeling</strong></p>
<p>Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Estimation</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object’s future position with precision.</p>
<p><strong>Target Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object’s location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target’s location more accurately.</p>
<h3 id="2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods Of Object Tracking"></a>2. Methods Of Object Tracking</h3><p>Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:</p>
<p><strong>OpenCV-Based Object Tracking</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking</strong> method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.</p>
<p><strong>MDNet</strong></p>
<p>Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.</p>
<p>The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSort</strong></p>
<p>DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.</p>
<p>DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ROLO</strong></p>
<p>ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#How-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit Recorded Video"></a>How to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg"
                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                      alt="obs customize the recording source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

For instance, do you wish to share meeting minutes or information with people missing in this meeting? Essentially the call recording is for other co-workers to view afterwards. Instead, you may use the recommended screen recorders to capture every moment and then use a specialist video editor like Filmora to make the required edits before sharing it with others.</p>

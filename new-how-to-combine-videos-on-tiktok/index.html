<ul>
<li>First, visit TikTok and click the ‘+’ icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-1.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you do this, you can advance to recording the clips you want.</li>
<li>Click the timer button at the top of the screen to choose how long you would like to shoot your video; you can select 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.</li>
<li>Before starting the countdown, drag the red bar by the audio track to where you want the clip to end.</li>
<li>You can repeat the recording many times to have many clips recorded.</li>
<li>Once you’re done recording, click the ‘adjust clip’ icon to adjust your video clips.</li>
<li>After adjusting, hit the ‘done’ button and have your combined video.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go ahead and share with your followers and the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Combining Function</strong></p>
<p>The second practical way you can combine TikTok videos into a single video is by using the app’s built-in combining function. To find out how you can use this technique for your videos, follow the steps outlined below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have the TikTok app on your device, open it and go to the menu bar. Select the ‘+’ button; it should be at the end of the screen.</li>
<li>Instead of recording through the TikTok camera, choose the ‘upload’ button, and it will take you to your device storage, where you can select the videos you would like to upload on TikTok.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-2.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, choose the ‘select multiple’ option at the left corner of your screen. Once you select this option, you can select different videos you would like to join together. Once you are satisfied with your choice, hit the ‘next’ button.</li>
<li>TikTok will allow you to combine the videos for up to 60 seconds. You can customize the video arrangement according to your preference.</li>
<li>If you’re satisfied with the final video result, click the next option, and you can share it on your TikTok account.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-3.jpg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>How to Combine Draft Videos on TikTok</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know how to combine videos on TikTok, you’re probably wondering about the best way to combine the drafts you saved on your TikTok account. Maybe when you made the videos, you were unmotivated to upload them. However, now you want to combine the videos into a single video and don’t know how to proceed. So, follow the steps outlined in this article to get it done.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Go to Your Drafts</strong></p>
<p>To begin, you have to launch the TikTok app and click on the ‘me’ option at the end of the screen. Then, it will redirect you to your profile, choose the ‘drafts’ category, and take you to the videos you saved on the app and never published.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Update Privacy Settings</strong></p>
<p>Now you want to change the privacy setting in the ‘who can watch this video’ category to ‘just me.’ After updating, tap on ‘post.’ After posting your video, you can change the setting by clicking on ‘change cut.’ You can reduce the video length and add new videos to combine TikTok drafts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Filters and More Effects</strong></p>
<p>You can also add music to your newly combined video and texts, stickers, filters, and many more effects to enhance your video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Draft</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-4.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>

<ul>
<li>To do this, go to TikTok and find the video you would like to duet</li>
<li>At the end of the screen, click on the ‘share’ option and choose ‘duet’ from the option available</li>
<li>Tap the red icon at the middle of the screen to start recording your video; your video usually appears on the left while the other video shows up in the right corner.</li>

<li>Replay the duet to ensure you like the result; you can add effects, stickers, and other editing features you want to the video before you post.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Set a Timer for Recording Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the ways you can record multiple scenes for a video is by using the recording tool; the steps below show you how to do that.</p>

<li>To do this, go to TikTok and find the video you would like to duet</li>
<li>At the end of the screen, click on the ‘share’ option and choose ‘duet’ from the option available</li>
<li>Tap the red icon at the middle of the screen to start recording your video; your video usually appears on the left while the other video shows up in the right corner.</li>
<li>Once you’re done recording, click the checkmark icon at the top of the screen to save your recording.</li>
<li>Replay the duet to ensure you like the result; you can add effects, stickers, and other editing features you want to the video before you post.</li>

<h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Glitch-Text-Effect"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Glitch-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Glitch Text Effect?"></a>How to Create a Glitch Text Effect?</h2><p>Have you noticed the glitching effect that appears when you play a video or in games, creating a sporadic shaky effect on video edges? While this usually signifies a systematic software issue in these cases, the effect itself can work to create a dynamic visual style for different objects when done intentionally.</p>
<p>In fact, many video editors today use the glitch effect on elements in their videos, like the introductory title in movies or trailers. It creates a futuristic look to the text, which highly appeals to viewers who engage more in the video itself.</p>
<p>Suppose you are looking to add a similar effect to the title of your video project or other text-based content that you will add to your video, use a good tool for that. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, in particular, makes adding this effect very simple.

<p>Next, you have to grab hold of the first snapshot that you click and move it to the Track 1 of the timeline. Use the cursor to hold it and reduce the size of the clip to the same amount as the first clip on Track 1.

<p>At this point, ensure the effect falls right above the first and second clip parts in the track below. Tap on the edges of this clip to reduce the size of the video effect, taking careful note to keep the clip 8 frames long overall.</p>
<p>Then, copy the cut-down effect from Track 3 and paste it at every intersectional point between the separated word-based clips in Track 2.</p>

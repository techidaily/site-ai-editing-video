                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Next, at the left corner of the interface set the Shape option as Tool Mode for drawing the vector shapes.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Next, choose the color of the rectangle shape, and to fill this select black at the Fill color swatch in the Options bar. A dialog box will appear to choose the type of fill and here you need to select the Solid Color option.</p>

<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> A shadow to the border can also be added by clicking on the icon of Layer Styles and then choosing the Drop Shadow option from the list.</p>

<p>Make sure to keep the playhead the same after you’ve taken the snapshot. You can find your screenshot in the media tab.</p>

<p>If you need help seeing what you’re masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.</p>

<p>Move the playhead forward and clean up your “mask.” Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.</p>

<p>Make sure to keep the playhead the same after you’ve taken the snapshot. You can find your screenshot in the media tab.</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-the-screenshot-to-timeline-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-the-screenshot-to-timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline"></a>Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline</h5><p>Let’s drag your screenshot onto video layer 2 and align it on the right side of the playhead. Then extend the screenshot so it lasts as long as your central clip.</p>

It will open the “Video” menu, then go into the “Mask” menu. Choose a mask shape and edit it so that it only covers where your subject is in the screenshot. <strong>For example,</strong> we choose the **”**Circle” mask shape in this video.</p>

                      alt="choose your mask shape"

<p>If you need help seeing what you’re masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.</p>

                      alt="hide the main video layer"
                ></p>
<p>Move the playhead forward and clean up your “mask.” Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.</p>

<h3 id="Tip-1-Making-a-steady-shot-is-important-1"><a href="#Tip-1-Making-a-steady-shot-is-important-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Making a steady shot is important"></a>Tip 1: Making a steady shot is important</h3><p>First, ensure <strong>a steady shot with no camera shake</strong> while filming. You can use a tripod or a stable surface to keep your camera still.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="keep your camera still"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Why is it necessary to make a steady shot?</strong></p>

<li>It is much more professional.</li>
<li>It will take your editing skills to a new level.</li>
<li>It grabs the attention of the viewers.</li>
<li>It makes your editing easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Tip-2-No-crossing-over-1"><a href="#Tip-2-No-crossing-over-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: No crossing over"></a>Tip 2: No crossing over</h3><p>Make sure <strong>your subject only crosses the same spot once</strong>. Otherwise, you would need help editing the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-19.gif"
                      alt="crossing over should be avoided"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Why is it necessary to avoid crossing the same spot?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It prevents misalignment of the shots, and your print won’t get damaged, primarily when you use pieces of the same image.</li>
<li>It helps to create an illusion of holding specific moments.</li>
</ul>

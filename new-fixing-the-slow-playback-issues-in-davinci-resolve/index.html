<h3 id="Solution-1-Lower-Playback-Resolution"><a href="#Solution-1-Lower-Playback-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution"></a>Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution</h3><p>In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the “Playback” menu from the top. Then, select “Timeline Proxy Resolution” and pick one either “Half” or “Quarter” options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.</p>

<h3 id="Solution-2-Change-Timeline-Resolution"><a href="#Solution-2-Change-Timeline-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution"></a>Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution</h3><p>DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the “Settings” icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”</p>
<p>Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on “OK.”</p>

<h3 id="Solution-3-Enable-Render-Cache"><a href="#Solution-3-Enable-Render-Cache" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Enable Render Cache"></a>Solution 3: Enable Render Cache</h3><p>It’s another solution to fix the <strong>DaVinci resolve slow playback</strong>. Render cache is a file that stores the rendered frames and makes the rendering faster. Start by hitting the “Playback” option and choose “Render Cache.” Then, you’ll see 3 options: None, Smart, and User. You should select “Smart” and let DaVinci Resolve pick one clip to be cached.</p>

<h3 id="Solution-4-Disable-the-Live-Save-Feature"><a href="#Solution-4-Disable-the-Live-Save-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature"></a>Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature</h3><p>Every change you make gets saved with the Live Save option in DaVinci Resolve. If your remote drive is linked, this feature can drag the playback speed down. You can disable it for a <strong>DaVinci resolve faster playback</strong>.</p>
<p>Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.</p>

<h3 id="Solution-5-Use-Proxy-Media-Files"><a href="#Solution-5-Use-Proxy-Media-Files" class="headerlink" title="Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files"></a>Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files</h3><p>Another solution is to use proxy media during the project editing. Proxy files are small copy files transcoded from a larger, original video file. Get the proxy file to increase the playback and go to your “Media Pool” in DaVinci Resolve. Right-click on the intended file and choose “Generate Proxy Media” from the list.</p>

You can read this section to understand the points that contribute to a good Slow-motion video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Keep the frame rate higher for a good slow-motion video. In this regard, you can use common frame rates such as 60fps, 120fps, and 140fps. Moreover, you should pick video clips that are originally captured in a high frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.</li>
<li><strong>Editing and Timing:</strong> Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.</li>

<h2 id="Part-4-Best-Kdenlive-Alternative-to-Edit-Videos"><a href="#Part-4-Best-Kdenlive-Alternative-to-Edit-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos"></a>Part 4. Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos</h2><p>Kdenlive has several drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the best video editor. Even though the features are sufficient for beginners, it is not suitable for professional editing. There is a lack of advanced options such as motion tracking or faster video production. Besides, the effects are very limited in number and so are the text and audio effects. That is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to Kdenlive Mac and Windows.</p>
<p>Filmora is a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >premium video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with video capturing feature. You can record your screen and webcam video. There is no dearth of effects, filters, elements and royalty-free media files. The user interface is cleaner and hence, it is suitable for both beginners and professionals. Here are the key features of Filmora.</p>

<h2 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-4"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-4" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>**<strong>Is Kdenlive a good editor?</strong></p>
<p>Kdenlive is a good editor if you are getting started in video editing or you are editing your video for personal usage. However, for professional and even social media videos, a premium video editor will be better. We recommend Filmora over Kdenlive because Kdenlive lacks advanced video editing options.</p>
<p>**<strong>Does Kdenlive cost money?</strong></p>
<p>Kdenlive Windows, Mac, and Linux are available free of cost as it belongs to the open-source software category. There is also no premium version available, and hence, all the features are unlocked in the free version.</p>
<p>**<strong>What can you do with Kdenlive?</strong></p>
<p>You can trim your video, add music, add effects, adjust speed, correct colors, and add green screen effect. Besides, you can add multiple video clips and audio files to the timeline. There are options for keyframable effects as well.</p>

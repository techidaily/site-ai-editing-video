FLV stands for “Flash Video”. It is a container file format like .mp4 and .mov. But it isn’t used quite frequently nowadays. They are mainly used for streaming videos. Because it provides compressed video while maintaining the quality and takes less space. It supports  codec which is compatible with most of the devices but you may need a flash player to play these files. If you have recently started working with .flv files or need more info about it then read till the end. We have gathered all the necessary information for you in this article.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Brake:</strong> It is another popular video converter that can convert a .flv file into almost any file format.</p>
<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>

Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>

Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size.

This Guide Will Introduce the Features and Show You How to Apply Effects to Videos with This Tool"></a>Movavi Slideshow Maker Is a Powerful Video Editing Tool that Can Be Used to Add Rich Effects to Videos Easily. This Guide Will Introduce the Features and Show You How to Apply Effects to Videos with This Tool</h2><p>Many video editors won’t be late in their artwork. They tend to use different effects to light up their crafts. For them, editing videos with effects applications gives more life to the story. In this composition, you will learn more about Effects, and if you are just about to do your video editing right now, these details are definitely for you.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-Video-Effects"><a href="#What-are-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Effects?"></a>What are Video Effects?</h2><p>According to the dictionary, an effect is brought about by a cause or an agency.</p>
<p>In video editing, there are a few video effects you must know to apply them to your video project. Video effects can alter the speed and produce distortions, reflections, aesthetic filters, stylistic color grading, animation transitions, and more. They can also contain 3D features like CGI. When used well, these effects improve the narrative, the atmosphere, and the images’ overall impact.</p>
<p>Let’s dissect a few of the major effects, which will be most helpful to you.</p>
<p><strong>Pans and Tilts</strong></p>
<p>Your first thought upon hearing these two words may be tripod motions. Pans and tilts are a quick way to add additional movement and sensation to your video, making it more dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Change the Speed&#x2F;Duration</strong></p>
<p>One feature that virtually every NLE or Non-Linear Editing software gives us is the option to modify the playback speed of your video while reducing or increasing the actual duration and tempo of your segments. Slowing down your footage to match the frame rate at which the video was initially captured is one of the critical explanations for doing this.</p>
<p>To incorporate some frantic or chaotic moments into your production, you can use this to generate slow-motion shots and fast-forward effects. This effect can also quickly pan through footage for humorous effect. Find the “Speed&#x2F;Duration” option under Effects controls to accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>Light Leaks and Flares</strong></p>
<p>Nothing gives your video a more ethereal vibe than gentle, warm light emerging from the scene. A direct source visible in the photo may be the source of this light, or it may enter the frame from the edge. You’ve probably seen these flares and leaks countless times in movies, whether they were added in post-production or resulted from the cinematographer’s lens choice. You can select where the light comes from if it doesn’t distract from the task. Remember that these spills and flares must contribute to the narrative while remaining barely perceptible to the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Retro&#x2F;VHS Effects</strong></p>
<p>While light leaks and lens flares give your movie or film a timeless feel, nothing gives it a dated or, one would say, “scrappy” vibe. The grunge appearance of the ‘90s is in right now, and one of the most popular effects is the VHS look.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get this effect. Applying a preset, essentially a LUT (look-up table or filter), to your color grade will make the image appear fuzzier, desaturated, and blurrier (using the different alpha and gamma channels). This will cause “chroma errors,” which result from poor recordings and a lack of a flying erase head (a function that enables you to record over previously filmed video; imagine formatting your SD card while the video is still present on the card and you are simply recording over it), giving your images an outline of distorted blues and reds.</p>
<p><strong>Color Grading and Color Correction</strong></p>
<p>Besides actual editing, color grading and correction are arguably the most significant post-production steps. With the help of these tools, you may alter skin tones, highlight, and shadow levels, add vignettes, experiment with contrast, and much more. We’ll briefly go through one aspect of color grading—the ability to adjust particular colors in your image—even though this subject needs its ebook.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Overlays</strong></p>
<p>Although we’ve talked about adding overlays, such as VHS effects or light leaks, you may use many other editing overlays to add particular components to your shot, including weather particles!</p>
<p><strong>Using Titles and Motion Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Motion graphics and clean titles are essential for any video that wishes to appear professional. These could be subtitles, and the animation logo reveals post-credits, lower thirds, or even major titles. There are various free typefaces available that you may use to make your project stand out, regardless of the program you’re working in.</p>
<p>Once you’ve selected the appropriate font, color, and weight, it’s time to move on to motion graphics. These are crucial because they may transform a clear, ageless title or text into a lively, entertaining illustration of the product or concept your movie is attempting to market.</p>
<p>The abundance of tutorials nowadays makes learning the fundamentals of motion graphics a piece of cake. As I previously stated, you can access all the various effects and movements you might need, regardless of the editing program, you use.</p>
<p>These various methods and approaches need the practice to perfect, just like any other component of filmmaking. As you add these video editing effects to your editing toolkit, there will undoubtedly be a lot of trial and error. Still, eventually, they will become second nature to your workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Applying Effects to your Video</strong></p>
<p>Almost from the first motion film, cinematic storytelling and video effects have gone hand in hand. They can improve a scene, create something that doesn’t exist, hide an error, and do much more. In essence, they assist a filmmaker in telling a tale in the manner they desire.</p>

                      alt="add files movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag the imported video that you want to edit onto the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Applying-Filter-effects"><a href="#Applying-Filter-effects" class="headerlink" title="Applying Filter effects"></a>Applying Filter effects</h2><p>A video filter is software that modifies a multimedia stream somehow. A filter graph is a series of filters that each accept input from an upstream filter, process the information, and then output the edited video to their downstream counterparts.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Filter</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click filter movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Filter effects depending on your preferred category.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="apply filter movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 You can see the preview of a Filter effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 If you finally chose a Filter effect, drag it onto the imported video.</p>
<p>Step5 And now you will see the changes. The “star” symbol on the imported video means you have already applied a Filter effect on it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="Adding-Transition-Effect"><a href="#Adding-Transition-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Adding Transition Effect"></a>Adding Transition Effect</h2><p>Transitions guide your audience.</p>
<p>From the opening to the very end, they structure the movie. There are numerous typical forms, including the wipe, dissolve, split-cut, and many others. Film editors use transitions to transfer a scene from one video clip to another practice. Transitions don’t need to be visible.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Transition</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click transition movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Transition effect depending on your preferred category.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-transition-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg"
                      alt="select transition movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 You can see the preview of a Transition effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/preview-filter-effect-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg"
                      alt="preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 If you finally chose a Transition effect, drag it between each imported video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-to-add-transition-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="choose to add transition movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Now you will see this kind of symbol, which means you have already put a Transition effect between the imported videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Transition effects can also be applied even if you have only one video. You can put transitions effects either at the start of the video, which could make your video introduction more appealing. Also, you can set the Transition effect at the end of the video, which could give you a pleasant closing.</p>
<p><em>Transition Effect at the start</em></p>
<p><em>Transition Effect at the end</em></p>
<p><em>Also, you can make your Transition effect longer or shorter simply by clicking this symbol then it will turn yellow. Point your cursor either on the left side of the symbol; the cursor will become a horizontal double-arrow to change the span of your Transition effect on the left video or on the right end side of the symbol to change the span of the Transition effect on the right video.</em></p>
<h2 id="Applying-Titling-Motion-Effect"><a href="#Applying-Titling-Motion-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Applying Titling Motion Effect"></a>Applying Titling Motion Effect</h2><p>Most video editing applications come with built-in titling choices, and many of them vary from basic letters to a collection of motion graphics that have already been pre-programmed. Enter your text into a template to insert them.</p>
<p>The majority of video projects have crucial titles. You can use them to build a mood, label key elements of the film, and convey information.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Title</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-title-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg"
                      alt="select title movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Titling motion effect depending on your preferred category. You can also see the preview of a title effect by clicking it before applying it to your selected video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-title-motion-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="select title motion movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To apply the Title Motion effect, drag the effect onto the title track, just above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-title-motion-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="drag title motion track movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 You can place your Title Motion effect on your desired time where you want it to appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-title-position-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="customize title position movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 To edit your Title texts, you can double-click the applied title on the title track or right-click on it and click the “edit” option. You can also edit the text by double-clicking the title portion on the current video editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-title-text-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="edit title text movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 In this step, you can edit the Title text in the “clip editing” section, as seen in the red color box. You can change the color, text style, and font size on the yellow color box. And in the green color box, you can change the alignment of the text; you can Bold it, Italizing, and make it an Underlined text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-color-text-title-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="add color text title movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 You can also adjust the time duration of the Titling Motion effect in two ways. First, by clicking the Title effect from the title track and placing your cursor on either side (the cursor will become a double-headed arrow), you have to shorten or lengthen the Title effect. The second step is to click the “Clip” section and adjust the duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-title-duration-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="change title duration movavi slideshow"
                ></p>

Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography</h3><p>Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).</p>
<p>Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.</p>
<p>The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 &#x3D; RT</p>

<p>PhotoPad is an old-school photo collage editor for PC that’s been around for a while. It’s a particularly good choice for those who choose to stick to the older versions of Windows (like XP or Vista), as you don’t see a lot of the newer software supporting those anymore.</p>
<p>Much like many of the other software that we included in this list, this one is more of a general photo editor than one strictly made for collages. However, it does come with functionalities for that, so you shouldn’t miss out on anything</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to Buy:</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Supports older Windows OS Systems</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Advanced photo editing functions</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Collage Feature for creating quick and easy collages</p>

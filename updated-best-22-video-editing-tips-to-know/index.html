By placing panels in the layout that best matches your working style, you can personalize your workspace. The additional panels adjust automatically to fit the window as you rearrange them. For various jobs, such as one for editing and one for preview, you can build and store multiple workspaces.</p>
<h3 id="Understand-the-timeline"><a href="#Understand-the-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Understand the timeline"></a>Understand the timeline</h3><p>The timeline of your video is the backbone of your digital video editing process. It’s called a timeline because the various pieces of video will be lined up horizontally. In a video editing software, the timeline is where you arrange your video clips and plan out all the modifications you want to do. As you work, you will see every single one of your video and audio clips, effects, and transitions sorted chronologically from beginning to end. All the fundamentals of video editing, including reordering, trimming, and enhancing your footage, are available. To preview how your adjustments will turn out, you can also play your project at any point in the timeline.</p>

Before adding clips to your timeline, it is suggested that you label each clip. Although it does seem like a lot of work, it will be easier to locate all of the clips later on if you’re working on a large project. after the footages are gathered and named, add important clips in the beginning of the timeline to begin establishing the video’s overall structure and order.</p>
<h3 id="Editing-tools"><a href="#Editing-tools" class="headerlink" title="Editing tools"></a>Editing tools</h3><p>Besides basic cutting, trimming and cropping, video editing software offer multiple professional editing tools which enhance the outlook your videos and make them 10x better. For example, instead of cutting up a clip into a bunch of small clips and unwanted gaps, use the Ripple Edit tool keep your timeline clean. This means when a clip is trimmed, it causes a ripple effect throughout the rest of your timeline, shifting all other clips into a new timeline position.</p>
<p>Similarly, when working with lengthy timelines, the Razor tool is also really helpful because you can select the clip you wish to cut by dragging your razor over it. So, the Razor cut is the tool to use if you need to make a lot of cuts in your videos quickly.</p>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming"><a href="#Trimming" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting"><a href="#Cutting" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming-1"><a href="#Trimming-1" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting-1"><a href="#Cutting-1" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

<p>Step 1: Open Filmora and remove all the pieces of the footage. Then arrange the rest of the footage as you see fit. Click on “Effects” on the upper left corner of your screen and then on “Filters”. Click on the Old Video effect and then drop it. After you add the filter on the segment of your video, you can drag the end of it to cover the whole duration of the movies. Click twice on the filter if you want to adjust the filter settings. Enter the desired values on the “Fade” parameter, “Frequency”, and “Alpha” options. Press “OK”, and this step is concluded.</p>

<p>Step 2: You can apply the black and white filters to any project in Filmora. It is very simple. Add one of the filters above the video you want to add the effect and drag one of the corners to adjust the duration. You can change the intensity through the alpha slider.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: In Filmora, you can add sepia tone rise or sun-kissed filters to your video. You are able to add desaturated filters while keeping colors like blue and green and with that create the old film style. If you want more brown and red tones, you can use the Sun-Kisser filter that highlights those colors. Adjust the filters with the alpha slider to change intensity.</p>

<p>Step 1: Open Filmora and remove all the pieces of the footage. Then arrange the rest of the footage as you see fit. Click on “Effects” on the upper left corner of your screen and then on “Filters”. Click on the Old Video effect and then drop it. After you add the filter on the segment of your video, you can drag the end of it to cover the whole duration of the movies. Click twice on the filter if you want to adjust the filter settings. Enter the desired values on the “Fade” parameter, “Frequency”, and “Alpha” options. Press “OK”, and this step is concluded.</p>

                      alt="old film overlay 1"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You can apply the black and white filters to any project in Filmora. It is very simple. Add one of the filters above the video you want to add the effect and drag one of the corners to adjust the duration. You can change the intensity through the alpha slider.</p>

                      alt="old film overlay 2"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: In Filmora, you can add sepia tone rise or sun-kissed filters to your video. You are able to add desaturated filters while keeping colors like blue and green and with that create the old film style. If you want more brown and red tones, you can use the Sun-Kisser filter that highlights those colors. Adjust the filters with the alpha slider to change intensity.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Under the black and white subcategory, you can find Ash and Willow filters. What these do is desaturate the contrast or exposure values as well as preset brightness and bring an older tone to your videos.</p>
<p>Step 5: You can correct any kind of filter. With the Advanced Color Correction Tab, you can navigate through features like Preset and Adjustment and desaturate your video. By clicking on the “Preset tab,” you can open a larger variety of presets, including the Old Film and Black &amp; White presets.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use several vintage apps like Retro VHS, 8mm Camcorder, and others.</li>
<li>Keep low highlights and low contrasts.</li>
<li>Keep low saturation and control the hue, saturation, and luminance of your video.</li>
<li>Film Overlays. With this, you can bring the mood just right. If you add a soft light overall to start with, it will instantly look slightly more vintage.</li>
<li>By decreasing contrast, you are darkening your videos and giving them a grainier old look.</li>
<li>If you bring up the black levels, you will leave more space for other tones to shine and turn the mood around your videos.</li>
<li>In contrast, if you bring down the whites in your videos, making even the brightest colors turn grey.</li>

<h2 id="Chroma-Key-Settings-in-OBS"><a href="#Chroma-Key-Settings-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Key Settings in OBS"></a>Chroma Key Settings in OBS</h2><p>Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.</p>
<p>Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.</li>
<li>Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install the software.

<li>Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.</li>
<li>If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.</li>
</ol>

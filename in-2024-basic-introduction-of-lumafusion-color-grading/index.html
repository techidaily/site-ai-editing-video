<p>Therefore, you can use the following steps to edit FLV video on Windows and Mac:</p>
<p>Step 1: Import file:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-1.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Edit the FLV file:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-2.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Acquire the perfect tool in your palm for anything you want to do, such as clipping, cropping, rotating, and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Furthermore, all editing capabilities in the toolbar allow drag-and-drop, making it even easier to touch up your films quickly. Consider the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop a transition into the video&#x2F;photo, or right-click it and select “Apply to All.”</li>
<li>Please drag &amp; drop a title template to the position where you want it to appear, then adjust it.</li>
<li>To use the effects, select one from the 50+ available video effects, select it, and apply it to your photos&#x2F;videos instantaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Save or Export the file:</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>When you’re done, export your modified MP4 files to Windows&#x2F;Mac and quickly share them on YouTube, with the option of sending a message to Facebook and Twitter. When you click Create in the program window’s middle right corner, you’ll be taken to the Output window below.</p>

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It’s a strong software with a lot of features.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:</p>
<p>Step 1: Create Project.</p>
<p>To make a movie in Final Cut Pro, you must first establish a project, which keeps track of your editing selections and the media you utilize.</p>

<p>Step 2: Select and add clips to the timeline:</p>
<p>The second stage in making a movie with Final Cut Pro is to add and arrange clips in your project. In the timeline, you can move and reorder clips.</p>

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

Final Cut Pro:"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Final Cut Pro:</strong></h3><p>When it comes to video editing software, Apple’s Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It’s a strong software with a lot of features.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:</p>
<p>Step 1: Create Project.</p>
<p>To make a movie in Final Cut Pro, you must first establish a project, which keeps track of your editing selections and the media you utilize.</p>

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities.

VSDC"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>VSDC</strong></h3><p>VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.</p>
<p>Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.</p>
<p>Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.</p>
<p>The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It’s very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select “Trim start” or “Trim finish” from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the “Cutting and Splitting” option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.</p>

                      alt="edit flv"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.</p>
<p>To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect’s duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.</p>
<p>Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Save changes and export video.</p>
<p>Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC’s resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you’re finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.</p>

<p> In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you’ll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the application.</p>

As a result, it’s widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.</p>
<p>The software’s Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities.

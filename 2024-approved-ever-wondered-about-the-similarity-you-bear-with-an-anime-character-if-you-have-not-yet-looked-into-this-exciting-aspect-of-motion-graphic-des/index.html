<p><strong>Specific Personality Traits: The Pragmatic Ones</strong></p>
<p>The pragmatic personality trait belongs to those who prefer a logical approach over an emotional one while making important decisions. If you have a pragmatic nature, you might stick to the straightforward attitude of looking at things, ahead of inclining towards the empathetic side. Entering into the anime world, you may find a series of characters resembling this specific aspect of your personality. One such character example is Kiritsugu Emiya from the anime series called Fate&#x2F;Zero.</p>
<p>Talking about the character in some detail, this character has a habit of sacrificing the smaller assets while hoping for bigger and greater opportunities. The habit eventually forces him to take certain painful and unwanted decisions. Mentioning a personal aspect, this one is a relatable character trait to my own personality. Considering the fact that I myself follow the line of logic to find out solutions to challenges and situations, I bear a complete resemblance with the character.</p>
<p>A downside of the pragmatic traits is their double faceted appearance to the viewers in case the latter fail to interpret the character in a correct form. It is a common assumption about these characters is that they wear a pretentious form to hide the actual aspects of personality from the onlookers.</p>

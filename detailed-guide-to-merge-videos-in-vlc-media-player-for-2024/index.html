            <h2 id="Detailed-Guide-to-Merge-Videos-in-VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#Detailed-Guide-to-Merge-Videos-in-VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="Detailed Guide to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player"></a>Detailed Guide to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player</h2><p>Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.</p>
<p>One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It’s not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good “player” as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.</p>
<p>Before we move on to video streaming, let’s look at two features that we can use in VLC player:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw" >Rotate a video in VLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don’t know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects &amp; Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M" >Cut&#x2F;trim video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don’t want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and&#x2F;or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem “without any problem” - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer’s My Video folder.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Merge-Multiple-Videos-in-VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Multiple-Videos-in-VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player"></a>How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player</h2><p>Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s" >step by step <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Technique one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open VLC media player.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-2.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Probably, you have already decided exactly which files you want to merge, so choose Open Multiple Files…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-3.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the opened window, click on Add in the File tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-4.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Select the desired clips from the newly opened window (selecting order matters, because it dictates which clips will come first and which ones will be next in the finished version), then click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-5.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Step two:</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected videos are shown in the File Selection list. At the bottom of the window, click the Arrow button next to the Play button, where you need to select Convert.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-6.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p> In the Profile, it is desirable to specify the following format: Video -  + MP3 (MP4), and below you can choose the Destination file - the location where you want to save the merged video. Also, to find the edited video easily, check the following: Append ‘-converted’ to file name. Click on Start. Wait until it is done - then you can play the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Technique two:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a New Folder and move the videos that you would like to merge Rename the videos (e.g. to 1, 2 etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new text file. Copy and paste this line below:</li>
</ul>

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Right-click on the app and choose Properties. A new window will be opened, where you need to go to Target. Select and copy the line.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Go to the text document file. Remove vlc_location and paste the copied text instead. Change the names of the video to match the names in the folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>That’s it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It’s not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good “player” as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.</p>
<p>Before we move on to video streaming, let’s look at two features that we can use in VLC player:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw" >Rotate a video in VLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don’t know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects &amp; Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M" >Cut&#x2F;trim video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don’t want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and&#x2F;or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem “without any problem” - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer’s My Video folder.</p>

This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s" >step by step <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Technique one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open VLC media player.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Probably, you have already decided exactly which files you want to merge, so choose Open Multiple Files…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the opened window, click on Add in the File tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-4.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Select the desired clips from the newly opened window (selecting order matters, because it dictates which clips will come first and which ones will be next in the finished version), then click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-5.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Step two:</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected videos are shown in the File Selection list. At the bottom of the window, click the Arrow button next to the Play button, where you need to select Convert.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-6.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p> In the Profile, it is desirable to specify the following format: Video -  + MP3 (MP4), and below you can choose the Destination file - the location where you want to save the merged video. Also, to find the edited video easily, check the following: Append ‘-converted’ to file name. Click on Start. Wait until it is done - then you can play the video.</p>

<p>That’s it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It’s not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good “player” as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.</p>
<p>Before we move on to video streaming, let’s look at two features that we can use in VLC player:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw" >Rotate a video in VLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don’t know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects &amp; Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M" >Cut&#x2F;trim video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don’t want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and&#x2F;or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem “without any problem” - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer’s My Video folder.</p>

This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s" >step by step <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Technique one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open VLC media player.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Probably, you have already decided exactly which files you want to merge, so choose Open Multiple Files…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the opened window, click on Add in the File tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-4.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Select the desired clips from the newly opened window (selecting order matters, because it dictates which clips will come first and which ones will be next in the finished version), then click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Step two:</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected videos are shown in the File Selection list. At the bottom of the window, click the Arrow button next to the Play button, where you need to select Convert.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p> In the Profile, it is desirable to specify the following format: Video -  + MP3 (MP4), and below you can choose the Destination file - the location where you want to save the merged video. Also, to find the edited video easily, check the following: Append ‘-converted’ to file name. Click on Start. Wait until it is done - then you can play the video.</p>

<p>That’s it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It’s not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good “player” as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.</p>
<p>Before we move on to video streaming, let’s look at two features that we can use in VLC player:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw" >Rotate a video in VLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don’t know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects &amp; Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M" >Cut&#x2F;trim video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don’t want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and&#x2F;or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem “without any problem” - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer’s My Video folder.</p>

This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s" >step by step <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Technique one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open VLC media player.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Probably, you have already decided exactly which files you want to merge, so choose Open Multiple Files…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the opened window, click on Add in the File tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-4.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Select the desired clips from the newly opened window (selecting order matters, because it dictates which clips will come first and which ones will be next in the finished version), then click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Step two:</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected videos are shown in the File Selection list. At the bottom of the window, click the Arrow button next to the Play button, where you need to select Convert.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p> In the Profile, it is desirable to specify the following format: Video -  + MP3 (MP4), and below you can choose the Destination file - the location where you want to save the merged video. Also, to find the edited video easily, check the following: Append ‘-converted’ to file name. Click on Start. Wait until it is done - then you can play the video.</p>

There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.</p>
<p>We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Gaming Montage"></a>How to Make a Gaming Montage</h2><p>You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you’ll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.</p>
<p>Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It’s much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.</p>
<h3 id="1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type"><a href="#1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type" class="headerlink" title="1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type"></a>1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type</h3><p>Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.</p>
<p>Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage"><a href="#2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2) Record Your Gameplay Footage"></a>2) Record Your Gameplay Footage</h3><p>The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.</p>
<p>That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you’ll capture the moment after interesting things occur.</p>
<p>Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Once you’ve all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer. This program allows you to edit your video clips and add cool effects that will make viewers keep watching.</p>
<h3 id="3-Import-You-Videos-to-Media-Library"><a href="#3-Import-You-Videos-to-Media-Library" class="headerlink" title="3) Import You Videos to Media Library"></a>3) Import You Videos to Media Library</h3><p>You only have to import the videos to Filmora’s media library and then drag and drop them into the timeline, where you can start making the edits.</p>
<p>By right-clicking on the clip in your timeline, you’ll see the options to zoom, speed, change, split, or trim your videos. You can also add sound effects by going to the Audio Tab.</p>

Make sure you use a license-free track if you plan to post it on social media.</p>
<p>Using copyrighted music tracks and uploading the video on social media platforms can lead to video strikes. Luckily, Filmora has loads of non-copyrighted music tracks.</p>
<p>Navigate to Stock Media, where you’ll find non-copyrighted music on Pixabay, and choose the one you prefer.</p>

<p>Additionally, the tool can identify any bad parts in your video and delete them so that the video matches the music.</p>
<p>The Effects tab allows you to add multiple overlays and filters to your gaming montage video. Filmora has different categories of overlays that let you add emotions or personality to your montage. You can also use it to set the tone in your video.</p>

<h3 id="1-Apply-Velocity-Effects"><a href="#1-Apply-Velocity-Effects" class="headerlink" title="1. Apply Velocity Effects"></a>1. Apply Velocity Effects</h3><p>Adding velocity effects to your montage will help get the attention of viewers. You can couple the transition between scenes with a speed ramping effect.</p>
<p>Include slow motion where there is a gunshot or other big gaming moment. You can then speed up things to quickly move into another scene. You can create these velocity effects in Filmora and make it smooth.</p>
<h3 id="2-Avoid-Game-Loading-Scenes"><a href="#2-Avoid-Game-Loading-Scenes" class="headerlink" title="2. Avoid Game Loading Scenes"></a>2.

<p>The popularity of gaming montage is growing every day in today’s pop culture. There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.</p>
<p>We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Gaming Montage"></a>How to Make a Gaming Montage</h2><p>You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you’ll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.</p>
<p>Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It’s much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.</p>
<h3 id="1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type-1"><a href="#1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type-1" class="headerlink" title="1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type"></a>1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type</h3><p>Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.</p>
<p>Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage-1"><a href="#2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage-1" class="headerlink" title="2) Record Your Gameplay Footage"></a>2) Record Your Gameplay Footage</h3><p>The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.</p>
<p>That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you’ll capture the moment after interesting things occur.</p>
<p>Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Once you’ve all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer.

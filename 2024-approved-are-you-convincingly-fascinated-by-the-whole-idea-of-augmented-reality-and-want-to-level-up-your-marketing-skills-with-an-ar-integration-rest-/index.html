<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Examples-of-Augmented-Reality-AR-In-Marketing"><a href="#Part-3-Examples-of-Augmented-Reality-AR-In-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing"></a>Part 3 <strong>Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing</strong></h2><p>Having discussed enough about the fundamental aspects of augmented reality, let us proceed towards understanding the credibility of <strong>augmented video</strong> in the light of modern day information centered applications. While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

Based in London, the Machine-A virtual store was conceptualized to allow the access of relevant audience to the works of new talent in the fashion field, when the Covid-19 pandemic caused a shutdown of the London Fashion Week.</p>
<p>The store was launched as a virtual boutique that could be visited by interested audience through a QR code, which could be scanned from billboards and posters around the London city, and allowed them to view the latest works of the associated fashion designers through an <strong>augmented reality concept video</strong>. The major success of the utility lies in the enhancement of the consumer-brand relationship, while focusing primarily on product awareness and customer engagement.</p>

<p>AI software can develop and build an intelligent application from the beginning with the help of deep learning capabilities and Machine learning. In addition, <strong>video recognition AI is the machine’s capacity to analyze, obtain, and process information that it receives from a visual source, specifically video. The video recognition systems help computers comprehend the information received in the large volumes of video feeds, frame by frame.</strong></p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AI-Video-Recognition-and-How-Does-Video-Recognition-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AI-Video-Recognition-and-How-Does-Video-Recognition-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?</strong></h2><p><strong>AI Video Recognition</strong> is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

<h3 id="Cool-Elements-3"><a href="#Cool-Elements-3" class="headerlink" title="Cool Elements"></a>Cool Elements</h3><p>For video editing, effects and transitions are not everything. Although they play a vital role in setting and making a good video but do, you know what else matters? Let’s guide you. To make creative and eye-catching content, you need to add elements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/mkv-file-format-9.jpg"
                      alt="insert attractive elements"
                ></p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Which-One-Is-Better-MKV-or-MOV-3"><a href="#Part-5-Which-One-Is-Better-MKV-or-MOV-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Which One Is Better? MKV or MOV?"></a>Part 5. Which One Is Better? MKV or MOV?</h2><p>MKV file format is not as commonly used as MOV because of its poor compatibility when it comes to mobile devices. If we talk about the file size, MKV tends to have a larger file size as compared to other used formats. MOV is a container file format that can store multiple media files of different tracks. Whereas MKV is an envelope format, even supporting to store complete movies with subtitles.</p>
<p>MKV format was developed by Matroska, whereas Apple developed the MOV file format. MKV format is good for storing HD videos, and MOV format is great for saving movies.</p>
<h3 id="Last-Words-3"><a href="#Last-Words-3" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>MKV format is a container format that can store different files with different encodings. The article above has discussed the file format in detail. We talked about how you can use the format, play MKV video format, and also how to edit MKV videos. We will conclude the article by suggesting a great video editor, Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>Features like Keyframing, Motion Tracking are offered by the software. Along with this, some advanced-level features are also provided, like Advanced Color Tuning, Green Screen, Video Snapshot, and many others. So, for creating a nice video with great editing elements, Wondershare Filmora is a must.</p>

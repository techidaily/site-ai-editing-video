And what’s the process that it takes us? How can we attract audiences and guarantee the viewers’ transition to loyalty? – these are the questions that people in the professions connected to the technology should ask. There is no recipe, but at least, we know what NOT to do – DO NOT create bad content! You will never have a desired amount of listeners for your podcasts if the voice of the actor or noise of the whole track is annoying, you will struggle to have success on Youtube if your shots are unpleasant to watch, and the list goes on – there are just too many things you should not do!</p>
<p>But sometimes bad quality just happens. It happens when you know you have a problem and it happens when you think everything is going well in producing. You might come back from the production and find out that every shot you took had bad lightning, or there was an almost naked guy running on the background, or there is a noise on the background that just makes the whole experience of watching and listening not worthwhile! This might be something that sinks your heart…</p>
<p>But the mistakes we make don’t ensure that there has been a verdict cast for our failure. Nowadays, the will is everything – if you are really willing to make something work, you will just have to find the right tools, and learn a little about them, and, Voila! – Maybe you can turn bad into something good? Unacceptable into something acceptable? Annoying into interesting, and unpleasant into enjoyable?</p>
<p>This is called EDITING. And Editing covers different, almost endless days – too many computer programs, too many tools, too many opportunities to modify almost anything you want to make look and sound better - All of this feels like magic!</p>
<p>Among many instruments and techniques, there is one thing called denoising, with two different meaning. You might find noise in two areas – video and audio. Audio denoising means to remove or reduce the background noise, such as air conditioner hum, someone screaming from far away, birds chirping, the waves, etc. the noise in photo and video terms means that the scene we are looking at is grainy and makes watching the scene a little more difficult, with a less clear picture. And whenever these kind of things appear, mostly out of the blue, – because no one wants to take a bad video or record a bad voice-over, - our magical tools and abilities come to play…</p>
<p>One of those is called Adobe Premiere Pro, using for video editing, viewed as the most sophisticated video editor software. So, in this article, we will learn how to handle bot noise-s – in video as well as audio terms, and how to create a better viewer&#x2F;listener experience in this very program. Lastly, we’ll touch upon an alternative for background noise removal, so, there’s nothing left but tuning in!</p>
<p><strong>Video denoising in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved through using effect which is called Median. Before discovering it, without any doubt, we need to add our footage into the Timeline in Premiere Pro. Then, we can proceed to finding the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found – just drag and drop the effect to your clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-1.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>In order to make sure that the Median touches the grainiest parts of the whole clip, we need to use something called masks. In the Effects Control panel, we can select the mask shape for our clip –either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. Pen tool is something with which we move the Mask around the screen and resize it to include the desired area and cover it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-2.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Changing Feather setting to 100 will make sure that the effect loses a visible edge and there is some smoothness added to those edges.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-3.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>There might be the need to repeat this process and create several masks, if that means to have covered all of the grainy area of the scene.</p>
<p>Lastly, tom reduce the noise, adjusting the effect settings is needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Technically, what the Median effect does is just blurring the graininess, not exactly “taking it away”. And if we play with the Radius settings there, we can find our desired look!</p>
<p><strong>How to remove background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Removing background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a pretty simple process and lead to much better results. First of all, of course, import the desired material into your software so you can see the video and audio in the sequence visually. After having the project set up, you will need to find the Efffects Panel, which might be hidden a little, but it must be on the left and bottom of the program layout; or, you can find it on the top, in the navbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-5.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>After having located the Effects panel, go for the search bar and type: denoise, and you’ll see that DeNoise effect is under Audio Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-6.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>You hold onto the effect, drag and drop it on the audio track in the timeline itself! Then, you just click on the audio in the sequence and on the top right Effect Controls will appear, which we need to concentrate on. You will scroll down a little there and below Audio notice: fx DeNoise, where you hit on the Edit button. This will open the Clip Fx Editor for the Audio denoising.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Basically, it only has one, Amount scale, and if you drag the slider of it to the right at 100%, it will remove the whole noise, but setting it on 0% will not remove any noise at all. So, you need to choose your preferred percentage! Just listen what is acceptable for you, but the general suggestion here would be that you can choose as high percent as you want, but if the effect starts taking out the voice and actually wanted parts, then you will have to stop and keep it that way. So, that’s actually it!</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip: how to remove audio noise in video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>What we have promised in the beginning in the video, we like to offer now – the alternative to reduce or remove audio noise in the video is called Wondershare Filmora, which functions in a very simple way. So, we can start using these guides:</p>
<p>Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-clicking on the video and hitting Detach Audio will enable us to separate audio and video from one another, getting us a chance to work on them individually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-8.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the audio track shows the editing panel, where we see Remove background noise – choosing this option removes the noise!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-9.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Though, there is another way to do this too. If you don’t want to detach the audio, then first, double-click on the video clip in the timeline and when the editing panel opens, switch to Audio. If you check the box next to Remove background noise, you will see that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, which determine the strength of how toe noise is going to be reduced. Choosing one of them is up to you!</p>
<p>In case you find that the voice sounds a little robotics, you’ll need to make it sound more natural, of course. For it, you will need to click Customize, which will take you into the Customize Equalizer department.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>The low tunes are on the left, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often the low ones, so we better lower them even more, but we would raise the middle ones to achieve a natural sound.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>And, that’s it – you are done with audio background noise removal!</p>
<p>So, in this article, we learned how to remove the video noise and grain and audio background noise using the software Adobe Premire Pro, while we also discussed how to do the latter using Wondershare Filmora – hope you can start using your new knowledge and tools very soon and create the content you never thought you could have created!</p>

<p>Though, there is another way to do this too. If you don’t want to detach the audio, then first, double-click on the video clip in the timeline and when the editing panel opens, switch to Audio. If you check the box next to Remove background noise, you will see that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, which determine the strength of how toe noise is going to be reduced. Choosing one of them is up to you!</p>
<p>In case you find that the voice sounds a little robotics, you’ll need to make it sound more natural, of course. For it, you will need to click Customize, which will take you into the Customize Equalizer department.</p>

<p>The low tunes are on the left, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often the low ones, so we better lower them even more, but we would raise the middle ones to achieve a natural sound.</p>

                ></p>
<p>And, that’s it – you are done with audio background noise removal!</p>
<p>So, in this article, we learned how to remove the video noise and grain and audio background noise using the software Adobe Premire Pro, while we also discussed how to do the latter using Wondershare Filmora – hope you can start using your new knowledge and tools very soon and create the content you never thought you could have created!</p>
<p>In order to make sure that the Median touches the grainiest parts of the whole clip, we need to use something called masks. In the Effects Control panel, we can select the mask shape for our clip –either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. Pen tool is something with which we move the Mask around the screen and resize it to include the desired area and cover it.</p>

<p>Changing Feather setting to 100 will make sure that the effect loses a visible edge and there is some smoothness added to those edges.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There might be the need to repeat this process and create several masks, if that means to have covered all of the grainy area of the scene.</p>
<p>Lastly, tom reduce the noise, adjusting the effect settings is needed.</p>
<p><img

<p>Technically, what the Median effect does is just blurring the graininess, not exactly “taking it away”. And if we play with the Radius settings there, we can find our desired look!</p>
<p><strong>How to remove background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Removing background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a pretty simple process and lead to much better results. First of all, of course, import the desired material into your software so you can see the video and audio in the sequence visually. After having the project set up, you will need to find the Efffects Panel, which might be hidden a little, but it must be on the left and bottom of the program layout; or, you can find it on the top, in the navbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>After having located the Effects panel, go for the search bar and type: denoise, and you’ll see that DeNoise effect is under Audio Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>You hold onto the effect, drag and drop it on the audio track in the timeline itself! Then, you just click on the audio in the sequence and on the top right Effect Controls will appear, which we need to concentrate on. You will scroll down a little there and below Audio notice: fx DeNoise, where you hit on the Edit button. This will open the Clip Fx Editor for the Audio denoising.</p>

<p>Basically, it only has one, Amount scale, and if you drag the slider of it to the right at 100%, it will remove the whole noise, but setting it on 0% will not remove any noise at all. So, you need to choose your preferred percentage! Just listen what is acceptable for you, but the general suggestion here would be that you can choose as high percent as you want, but if the effect starts taking out the voice and actually wanted parts, then you will have to stop and keep it that way. So, that’s actually it!</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip: how to remove audio noise in video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>What we have promised in the beginning in the video, we like to offer now – the alternative to reduce or remove audio noise in the video is called Wondershare Filmora, which functions in a very simple way. So, we can start using these guides:</p>
<p>Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-clicking on the video and hitting Detach Audio will enable us to separate audio and video from one another, getting us a chance to work on them individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-The-Fundamentals-to-Get-You-Started-on-Storyboard"><a href="#Part-1-The-Fundamentals-to-Get-You-Started-on-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 The Fundamentals to Get You Started on Storyboard"></a>Part 1 The Fundamentals to Get You Started on Storyboard</h2><p>Speaking in the light of blooming your creative skills and abilities, the realm of graphic and video editing has managed to unleash a never ending and dimensionless canvas to experiment with your skills. Talking of the most recent add-ons to the already long list of utilities, storyboards have emerged as a revolution in the field of motion graphic customization and design.</p>
<p>Diving a bit deeper into understanding the credibility of storyboards, let us move ahead with having an insight of different aspects and elements of the same in the upcoming sections of this article:</p>
<p><strong>What is a Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Attempting to define a <strong>storyboard</strong>, you can regard the utility as a sequential setup of sketches, images, elements and illustrations that create a road map to address a video editing task. Dividing the entire process into a series of individual processes, the aforesaid facility caters to ease out the video creation task.</p>
<p>Moving ahead to draft a technical explanation of storyboards, they are a collection of chronologically arranged drawings, supplemented with video customization elements, such as dialogues, camera direction and other allied detailing. The fundamental merit of these visual arrangements lies in the sequential and scene unfolding of a video footage.</p>
<p>This in turn, works to simplify the film creation process, while ensuring the latter’s cohesiveness and facilitating the elimination of errors and inconsistencies. It is a common mistake to regard storyboards as a midway and optional utility, these trial and error representations are quite essential to ensure a flawless video output in the final stage of design. The facility works additionally to minimize unnecessary production delays, while significantly cutting down on the overall creation cost.</p>
<p>Having a visibility more or less similar to a comic strip, storyboards have a varying scale of design, ranging from being modestly simple to explicitly complex, in cohesion with the specific creation requirements. These visual scripts are mostly hand crafted, through there are a host of storyboard creation software packages and programs available in the IT design market, as well as across the web.</p>
<p>Extending our discussion a bit further, let us have a walk-through of the essential storyboard categories and types in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Traditional Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>These are a logically placed sequence of hand crafted drawings in ink or pencil for representing the video filming chronology, prior to the start of the actual creation process. You can conveniently observe the sequential arrangement of your video elements through these storyboards by placing them at a suitable space, like your studio wall.</p>
<p>You are granted the liberty to add as much detailing to these drawings as you wish, while using them for filming either a single or a series of film shots. These easily editable storyboards are often supplemented with written text notes for describing the events of a specific scene.</p>

                      alt="Types of Storyboards- Traditional Storyboard"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Thumbnail Storyboards</strong></p>

While the utility works to define a sequential arrangement of shots and elements in a specific video scene, the real effort lies in converting a text centered movie or scene script into a storyboard. Talking of the ways to address this concern, let us discuss about these storyboard essentials in some detail in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>What Comes First – Script or Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to comment on the sequence of the aforesaid elements within a film production process, let us first proceed to have an understanding of the terms in a fundamental sense. A script is essentially a text based document that presents a cumulative picture of the video story by unveiling the latter’s storyline and theme. Storyboards on the other hand, are pictorial representations of sequentially arranged shots of the movie with a much more comprehensive detailing.</p>
<p>Going through the above definitions, the obvious and logical sequence of filming out a video is quite clear with scripts preceding the storyboards. Talking a bit on the credibility aspect of these video production stages, the film’s script caters to provide an elementary insight into some of the most essential visual commands. Crafting a storyboard on the other hand, is dedicated towards depicting a detailed follow through of each shot in line with the events described in the script.</p>
<p>Working towards a classic and professional video production task, hence demands a drafting of the latter’s script, which is then succeeded by crafting a storyboard. This facilitates a seamless and easy video creation process with lesser ambiguities. Having talked enough about scripts and storyboards, let us now move ahead with creating storyboards from a film script in the following section:</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Stop Aiming to Become a Perfectionist</strong></p>
<p>Considering the fact that you are crafting the storyboard just for the purpose of depicting a sequence of video shots, do not aim at defining every element in comprehensive detail. Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>

Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>

                ></p>

</ol>
<p>If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4.

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘<strong>resizing video</strong>’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the <strong><em>File</em></strong> and then to the <strong><em>Project Settings</em></strong><em>.</em> Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by cropping</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adjust the file size of the video through export settings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the <strong><em>Export</em></strong> button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4.

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘<strong>resizing video</strong>’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the <strong><em>File</em></strong> and then to the <strong><em>Project Settings</em></strong><em>.</em> Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by cropping</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adjust the file size of the video through export settings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the <strong><em>Export</em></strong> button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4.

Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘<strong>resizing video</strong>’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the <strong><em>File</em></strong> and then to the <strong><em>Project Settings</em></strong><em>.</em> Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Resize the video by cropping</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.</p>

                      alt="resize flv"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adjust the file size of the video through export settings</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the <strong><em>Export</em></strong> button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.</p>

<h2 id="FAQs-about-Resizing-FLV-Video-3"><a href="#FAQs-about-Resizing-FLV-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Resizing FLV Video"></a><strong>FAQs about Resizing FLV Video</strong></h2><p>Here are some of the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to resizing FLV videos that you might be interested in:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How do I make FLV files smaller?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can make FLV files smaller with the help of any video editor that supports Flv video format by cutting and cropping out unnecessary parts, decreasing the resolution, and bitrate, and converting flv into another lighter file format.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Which video editors support FLV file format?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are few video editors like Filmora, Movavi, VSDC, etc. that support the FLV file format. But when it comes to editing FLV videos, Filmora Video Editor is the best choice.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How do I view an FLV file?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>FLV is one of the oldest video formats due to which most new and modern video players don’t recognize it or can’t play it. However, there are few programs like VLC media players which can help you view an FLV file. Or you can also convert the FLV file into other supported video formats with the help of a video converter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can I convert a horizontal FLV video into a vertical one?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, and that’s a piece of cake when you use Filmora Video Editor or other similar video editors. You just need to change the aspect ratio of the video or the project from horizontal (generally 16:9) to vertical (generally 9:16).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can I resize FLV video files on my mobile?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Though video editors on mobile are not as powerful as those on PC, there are some that are still capable enough to let you easily resize FLV video files on mobile devices. Some examples are Splice, Powerdirector, etc.</p>

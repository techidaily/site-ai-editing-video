<h3 id="Benefits-of-Using-Motion-Blur-Effect"><a href="#Benefits-of-Using-Motion-Blur-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect"></a>Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect</h3><p>There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:</p>
<p><strong>· Perfect For Idolizing Speed</strong></p>
<p>The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.</p>
<p><strong>· Resolves Flickering</strong></p>
<p>Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.</p>
<p><strong>· Attenuates Real-Effect</strong></p>
<p>One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-You-Motion-Blur-An-Object-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-You-Motion-Blur-An-Object-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?"></a>Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?</h2><p>As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on <strong>how to add motion blur in Blender</strong>:</p>
<p>Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the “Render Properties.” Look to enable “Motion Blur” from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg"
                      alt="enable the motion blur option"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Start by setting its “Position” in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use “Center on Frame.” If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the “Shutter” value or vice versa.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the shutter value"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Following this, define the “Background Separation” according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the “Max Blur” pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg"
                      alt="set background separation and max blur"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.</p>

<p>Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.</p>
<p>The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.</p>
<p>Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.</p>
<p>Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we’ll show you in this article.</p>

<p>Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.</p>
<p>The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.</p>
<p>Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.</p>
<p>Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we’ll show you in this article.</p>

<p>Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.</p>
<p>The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.</p>
<p>Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#How-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit Recorded Video"></a>How to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg"
                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                      alt="obs customize the recording source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

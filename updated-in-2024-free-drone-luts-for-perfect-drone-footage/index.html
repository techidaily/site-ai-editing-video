<h2 id="OBS-Green-Screen-Guide"><a href="#OBS-Green-Screen-Guide" class="headerlink" title="OBS Green Screen Guide"></a>OBS Green Screen Guide</h2><p>OBS Studio is a free and open-source app for screen-casting and live streaming. Written in C&#x2F;C++ and built with Qt, OBS Studio provides real-time capture, scene composition, recording, encoding, and broadcasting via the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).It can stream Videos to any RTMP supporting destination including YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>You only need one green screen software – OBS. The reason why OBS is the most recommended for streaming is because once you have set it up properly, you can do literally anything you can think of with the software (either with or without added plug-ins).</p>
<h2 id="Chroma-Key-Settings-in-OBS"><a href="#Chroma-Key-Settings-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Key Settings in OBS"></a>Chroma Key Settings in OBS</h2><p>Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.</p>
<p>Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.</li>
<li>Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install the software. Open OBS and let the Auto-Configuration Wizard optimize the software’s settings based on your hardware.</li>
<li>Now you can add a video source.</li>
<li>Right-click on the video source you’ve created and select Filter.</li>
<li>Click the + button under the Effects Filters section and select Chroma Key.</li>
<li>Type in a name for this effect layer.</li>
<li>After you add a chroma key, OBS will automatically create and adjust the baseline settings for the filter. You can experiment with the sliders and settle when you are satisfied with the result.</li>
<li>Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.</li>
<li>If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pro tip:</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.</p>

In This Article, We’ll List You some Tips to Help Capture a High-Quality Video on Your Phone</h2><p>Never before has video recording been so simple or effortless. Everybody has a smartphone, which is a capable video camera, in their pocket. In fact, the use of smartphones for mobile creation has increased to the point that some people consider it to be the main function and equally crucial to communication.</p>
<p>Pocket-lint has compiled ten ideas in an effort to assist you in getting whatever it is you want in the best possible way. Even if some of the advice may seem apparent, using it all should always produce fantastic videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/shoot-a-video-on-phone.jpg"
                      alt="shoot a video on phone"
                ></p>
<h2 id="1-Get-ready-for-filming"><a href="#1-Get-ready-for-filming" class="headerlink" title="1. Get ready for filming"></a>1. Get ready for filming</h2><p>Make sure that you have everything you need to start recording your videos, including the necessary</p>
<p>equipment, props, scripts, actors, and locations, before you start the recording process. In addition, ensure that your mobile device is of high quality and that it has a sufficient amount of storage space (available memory) to save the film. High definition (HD) video files can be quite large and storing them can quickly deplete a battery’s capacity.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-ready-for-filming.jpg"
                      alt="get ready for filming"
                ></p>
<p>They add a great point; you need to think about stabilization, and they’ve included a few great options for</p>
<p>obtaining steady video. This video by Filmic Pro titled “5 Things to Do Before You Shoot iPhone Video” covers a lot of what we’ve discussed as well, including memory storage, battery life, audio, and resolution.</p>
<h2 id="2-Use-good-lighting"><a href="#2-Use-good-lighting" class="headerlink" title="2. Use good lighting"></a>2. Use good lighting</h2><p>Because smartphone cameras have smaller image sensors and lenses, proper illumination has a significant impact on their performance. As much as you can, try to film your video in well-lit environments. By doing this, you can reduce the amount of unwanted shadow and grain in your video. On the other hand, you also need to be cautious to avoid pointing the camera straight towards bright light sources because this will result in useless overexposed footage and lens flare. The lighting should be consistent and steady because most smartphone image sensors take a while to respond to abrupt changes in brightness.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/use-good-lighting.jpg"
                      alt="use good lighting"
                ></p>
<p>If shooting your video in low light is still difficult, experiment with your phone’s or app’s backlighting and white balance settings. In case your camera is focusing on the incorrect part of your composition, most phones now provide “touch focusing.” The automatic exposure control will have an easier time making minor adjustments if the lighting condition changes once the focus has been placed on the most crucial part of the video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Film-horizontally-not-vertically"><a href="#3-Film-horizontally-not-vertically" class="headerlink" title="3. Film horizontally, not vertically"></a>3. Film horizontally, not vertically</h2><p>Your natural inclination may be to hold the smartphone in a vertical position when you are using it to record video, just as you do when you are using it for the vast majority of other purposes. However, if you want to edit your video and post it online and on social media, this may place certain restrictions on your ability to do so.</p>

<h2 id="4-Make-sure-to-have-good-audio"><a href="#4-Make-sure-to-have-good-audio" class="headerlink" title="4. Make sure to have good audio"></a>4. Make sure to have good audio</h2><p>We’re going to go ahead and say that sound is one of the most essential components of any video. The difficulty is in the fact that the audio quality on your smartphone is not always of the highest caliber. When it comes to audio, there is a general rule that the smartphone should be as close to the speaker as is physically possible in order to obtain the clearest sound possible from it. Even if you are only a few meters away from the person whose voice you want to record on your smartphone, you won’t be able to get a good recording of them.</p>
<p>This is not the fault of your smartphone; rather, smartphones are intended to be used by speaking into them at close range; hence, you should think about employing the use of an external microphone in order to improve the sound quality. However, if you are unable to do so, there is no need for concern because you can use an additional smartphone in its place.</p>
<p>You can record audio on your mobile device by opening the voice memo app and selecting the record button. Your audio will immediately be improved if you position the phone’s microphone such that it is facing your topic and is somewhat close to them. Clap once at the beginning of the recording to serve as a reference point for both the video and the audio, which will help you save time while editing. After that, it will be simple for you to locate the point at which the clap occurred and synchronize the high-quality audio that is on the memo with the audio that is in your film.</p>
<h2 id="5-Edit-your-video"><a href="#5-Edit-your-video" class="headerlink" title="5. Edit your video"></a>5. Edit your video</h2><p>Now that you’ve gathered all of your film, it’s time to cut it up, add some color, and get creative with effects! Fortunately, there are numerous video editing apps available that make it easier and faster than ever to use. You can edit videos on your phone just as you would on a computer using apps like Adobe Rush and iMovie, and it’s easier than you think.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You’ve probably heard of iMovie, Apple’s free video editing software that works on both your iPhone and Mac. You can add titles, music, and additional effects to your video clips, much like in Adobe Rush. iMovie is really easy to use, especially if you’re new to editing. The main distinction between Adobe Rush and iMovie is that Adobe Rush includes more professional and technical changes, whilst iMovie has a considerably larger selection of video effects and transitions.</p>
<p>Adobe Rush is the most user-friendly app for editing and creating high-quality films on your smartphone. One of Adobe Rush’s best features is the ability to incorporate motion graphics, video effects, text, and mix audio. If you prefer a larger screen to edit on, Adobe Rush seamlessly transfers the files to your computer, allowing you to resume editing where you left off on your smartphone. This program is simple to use, and there are numerous guidelines and tutorials available online to help you get started.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You probably weren’t aware of this, but your smartphone is actually a very capable piece of equipment that can be used to record videos of a high quality. You will be able to enhance the quality of your material to a greater extent by putting into practice the strategies that are discussed in this piece. Grab your smartphone and get ready to start producing content that the people in your fanbase will always come back for.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<h2 id="Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-2"><a href="#Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-2" class="headerlink" title="Capture the moment and Cut"></a>Capture the moment and Cut</h2><p>CapCut is a free all-in-one video editing app that helps you create amazing videos. It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

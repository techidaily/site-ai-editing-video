<p>LumaFusion is affordable, especially non-linear editors (NLEs) with similar details. When it comes to robust features, LumaFusion retakes the spotlight. This video editor will become your favorite tool in no time.</p>
<p>Here are some exciting things you can do using LumaFusion:</p>
<h4 id="●-Enjoy-a-Simplified-SSD-and-Cloud-Storage-Importing-Process"><a href="#●-Enjoy-a-Simplified-SSD-and-Cloud-Storage-Importing-Process" class="headerlink" title="● Enjoy a Simplified SSD and Cloud Storage Importing Process"></a>● Enjoy a Simplified SSD and Cloud Storage Importing Process</h4><p>One of the best things about LumaFusion is your ability to import from SSD and cloud storage seamlessly. If you’re using an external SSD for playback media, this feature will excite you. LumaFusion automatically imports media from your SSD whenever you add video clips to the timeline. There’s no need to waste time importing media by yourself.</p>
<h4 id="●-Switch-Between-Six-Workspace-Layouts"><a href="#●-Switch-Between-Six-Workspace-Layouts" class="headerlink" title="● Switch Between Six Workspace Layouts"></a>● Switch Between Six Workspace Layouts</h4><p>LumaFusion features six workspace layouts. So you can choose whatever one works best for the project you are working on. With the layout button, you can scramble the source viewer, browser, and timeline to your preference. LumaFusion also gives you the option of viewing the content in portrait or landscape modes. It’s a truly customizable and advanced multitrack video editing app for everyone who loves ease.</p>

Then there’s exciting news for you. Lumafusion allows you to export specific project files so that you can work on the NLE. Even though this feature is only available for a fee, it offers excellent value for its $20 price. You can hardly have it cheaper with other NLEs.</p>
<h4 id="●-Leverage-Its-Intuitive-UI-UX"><a href="#●-Leverage-Its-Intuitive-UI-UX" class="headerlink" title="● Leverage Its Intuitive UI&#x2F;UX"></a>● Leverage Its Intuitive UI&#x2F;UX</h4><p>This is no hoax—LumaFusion’s intuitive design will blow your mind.

<h4 id="●-Enjoy-the-Automated-Audio-Ducking-Feature"><a href="#●-Enjoy-the-Automated-Audio-Ducking-Feature" class="headerlink" title="● Enjoy the Automated Audio Ducking Feature"></a>● Enjoy the Automated Audio Ducking Feature</h4><p>Audio ducking involves temporarily lowering a specified audio signal’s volume when another one comes up. Having to do this manually can be tiring. Fortunately, with LumaFusion’s automatic audio ducking feature, you don’t have to worry about that anymore. All you need to do is assign speakers and music tracks as master and auto track. The audio ducking feature takes it up from there.</p>

This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.</p>
<p>With color grading, you can adjust your video’s color balance, saturation, contrast, luminance, black level, etc. It helps to evoke the particular emotions or moods that you want your videos to exude.</p>
<p>These are the essential things to note about color grading in LumaFusion:</p>
<h4 id="1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading"><a href="#1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?"></a>1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>
<p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p>
<p>Fortunately, LumaFusion allows you to import and apply LUT (look-up tables). With LumaFusion LUTs, you can color grade your footage to your satisfaction.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-To-Color-Grade-in-LumaFusion"><a href="#2-How-To-Color-Grade-in-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="2. How To Color Grade in LumaFusion"></a>2. How To Color Grade in LumaFusion</h4><p>This is how to color grade your videos:</p>
<p>○ First, Color Correct</p>
<p>When attempting to color grade your footage, it’s essential that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >color correct <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it first. Color correction ensures that your video doesn’t remain flat or unexciting.</p>
<p>○ Create Your LUTs</p>
<p>LUT allows you to save specific color grades to use anytime you need them. This helps to save time by ensuring that you don’t develop color spaces all over again when working on various footage. You can also download as many free LUTs as you like.</p>
<p>○ Bring In a LUT</p>
<p>After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It’s that simple!</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion"><a href="#3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?"></a>3. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?</h4><p>The short answer is a big YES. You can apply multiple LUTs in LumaFusion.</p>
<p>Here’s how t go o about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply your first LUT</li>
<li>Export the LUT</li>
<li>Access rendered movies</li>
<li>Apply the second LUT</li>
</ol>
<p>There is numerous manipulation you can do with LUT. For example, you can merge two or more LUTs into one.</p>
<h2 id="Does-LumaFusion-Have-a-Desktop-Version"><a href="#Does-LumaFusion-Have-a-Desktop-Version" class="headerlink" title="Does LumaFusion Have a Desktop Version?"></a>Does LumaFusion Have a Desktop Version?</h2><p>Do you own a PC or desktop[, and you’re wondering how to access LumaFusion’s unique features on it?

Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>
<p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p>

Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their <strong>brand storytelling</strong>. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray <strong>your brand story</strong> than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.</p>
<p>Modern-day consumers are much more educated and sophisticated than before. You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their <strong>branding and storytelling</strong> strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own <strong>brand storytelling video</strong> and are wondering how to make it a successful one.</p>

Spotify - All Ears On You</h3><p>Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.</p>
<p>One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get the Most Out of Big Data:</strong> The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage User-Generated Content:</strong> Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize The Trending Hashtags &amp;</strong> <strong>Topics</strong>: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.</li>

<p><strong>Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>

<h3 id="3-Apple-Chase"><a href="#3-Apple-Chase" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple - Chase"></a>3. Apple - Chase</h3><p>Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.</p>

While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.</p>
<p>Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.</p>
<h3 id="4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos"><a href="#4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos"></a>4.

They don’t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - ‘Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:</p>

<p>They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.</p>
<p>Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:</p>
<p><strong>Sentimentality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.</li>
<li>The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.</li>
<li>Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.</li>

<h3 id="1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You-1"><a href="#1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Spotify - All Ears On You"></a>1. Spotify - All Ears On You</h3><p>Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.</p>
<p>One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get the Most Out of Big Data:</strong> The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage User-Generated Content:</strong> Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize The Trending Hashtags &amp;</strong> <strong>Topics</strong>: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms</li>
<li>Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions</li>

<p>Their official tagline also turned out to be ‘Belong Anywhere,’ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure it’s instantly recognizable.</p>
<p><strong>Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization</strong>: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.</li>
<li><strong>It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story</strong>: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.</li>
<li><strong>Content Is The King:</strong> Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Apple-Chase-1"><a href="#3-Apple-Chase-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple - Chase"></a>3.

While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.</p>
<p>Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.</p>
<h3 id="4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos-1"><a href="#4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos"></a>4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos</h3><p>If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dIAMe1sQno" >LeBron James <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They don’t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.</p>
<p>This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audience’s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - ‘Just do it with Nike products.

<li>They promote the advantages of their product’s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called <strong>benefit-based marketing practice</strong>.</li>
<li>They <strong>sell brand stories more than their products</strong>, which has always been their primary marketing strategy.</li>
<li>Nike is very strong in the <strong>social media game</strong>. They leverage user-generated content to create their video ads.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborating with influencers</strong> like LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo has always been at the core of their marketing strategy.</li>

Bells - Reader</h3><p>The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the ‘Bells-Reader’ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.</p>
<p>They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.</p>
<p>Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:</p>
<p><strong>Sentimentality:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.</li>
<li>The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.</li>
<li>Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.</li>
<li>To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f" >https://www.youtube.com/watch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>

<h2 id="How-to-Add-Custom-Subtitles-to-Netflix"><a href="#How-to-Add-Custom-Subtitles-to-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix"></a>How to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix</h2><p>Netflix is the most popular streaming service in the world. It offers loads of movies and series that you can watch on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Over the years, Netflix has become a one-stop destination for watching movies and TV shows in different languages.</p>
<p>While the user base of Netflix is quite diverse, the platform offers subtitles in limited languages for most movies and series. Suppose you want to view a Korean Drama on Netflix with French subtitles. However, you found that French subtitles are unavailable for that Korean Drama. In such a case, you might wonder if adding custom subtitles to Netflix is possible.</p>
<p>Well, you can add subtitles to Netflix, and there are two different methods to do the same. This guide will help you learn both methods available for adding custom subtitles to Netflix. So, let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Method-1-Upload-Your-Custom-Subtitle-to-Netflix"><a href="#Method-1-Upload-Your-Custom-Subtitle-to-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Upload Your Custom Subtitle to Netflix"></a>Method 1. Upload Your Custom Subtitle to Netflix</h2><p>Before proceeding with this method, you must remember that it only works if you are a Netflix Premium user. Now, let’s discuss how to add subtitles to Netflix with this method.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Steps-to-Follow"><a href="#Key-Steps-to-Follow" class="headerlink" title="Key Steps to Follow"></a>Key Steps to Follow</h3><p>Below are the steps for adding custom subtitles to Netflix.</p>
<p>Step 1 First of all, you need to install and add <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/bekopgepchoeepdmokgkpkfhegkeohbl?hl=en-US" >Language Learning with Netflix &amp; YouTube™ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> extension to your web browser (Chrome or Edge).</p>
<p>Step 2 Make sure the extension is activated.</p>
<p>Step 3 Download the .srt file that contains the subtitles in your preferred language for a particular movie or TV show.</p>
<p>Step 4 Open Netflix on a Chrome or Edge browser and sign into your account.</p>
<p>Step 5 Play the movie or TV show for which you have downloaded the subtitles.</p>
<p>Step 6 Within the Netflix player, you will see a settings icon left to the <strong>Subtitles</strong> icon. Click on it.</p>
<p>Step 7 Among the various setting options, you need to choose the screen and find the one with the label “Lower Subtitles (Mother Language)”. You need to click on its field and select the “Upload Subtitle” option.</p>
<p>Step 8 You will see a pop-up window at the top of the screen where you need to click the “Choose File” button.</p>
<p>Step 9 You then need to navigate to the directory on your computer where you have downloaded the subtitles file, select it, and click the “Open” button.</p>
<p>Step 10 Click the “Okay” button to upload the subtitles to Netflix.</p>
<p>Step 11 Close the settings window and play the video. You can view the uploaded subtitles at the bottom of the player.</p>
<h2 id="Method-2-Add-Custom-Subtitles-to-Netflix-with-Extensions"><a href="#Method-2-Add-Custom-Subtitles-to-Netflix-with-Extensions" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Extensions"></a>Method 2. Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Extensions</h2><p>If you’re not a Netflix Premium user, you can still add subtitles to Netflix with the help of certain browser extensions. We’ll list them down and discuss the steps for using one of them; the basic steps for using all such extensions are pretty much the same.</p>
<h3 id="1-Substital"><a href="#1-Substital" class="headerlink" title="1. Substital"></a>1. Substital</h3><p><strong>Supported web browsers:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en" >C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en" >hrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> | <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/substital/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> | <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/substital-add-subtitles-/dkkffblkjnedaekodhiblomkicklmjnp?source=sfwOPERA" >Edge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Substital is among the most popular extensions that allow you to add subtitles to several online on-demand video streaming platforms, including Netflix. It has more than 100K users on the Chome Web Store.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers a built-in subtitles search feature.</li>
<li>Supports .srt files and .zip files containing subtitles in the .srt format.</li>
<li>You can manually sync the subtitles with the video.</li>
<li>It allows you to customize the appearance of subtitles.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Substital</strong></p>
<p>Following are the key steps to add custom subtitles to Netflix using the Substital extension:</p>
<p>Step 1 The first thing you need to do is to download and install the Substital extension on your browser.</p>
<p>Step 2 Open Netflix on the same browser and log in to your account.</p>
<p>Step 3 Play the movie or episode from a TV series for which you want to add custom subtitles.</p>
<p>Step 4 Download the subtitles file for the same movie or episode in your preferred language from the web.</p>
<p>Step 5 Now open the extensions menu in your browser and click on the Substital icon.</p>
<p>Step 6 You will see the name of the movie or TV show that you are watching on Netflix. Click on it.</p>
<p>Step 7 In this step, you need to drag and drop the subtitle file from your system (that you downloaded earlier) to the browser window.</p>
<p>Step 8 Finally, you can notice that the subtitles are loaded in the Netflix player.</p>
<h3 id="2-Super-Netflix"><a href="#2-Super-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="2. Super Netflix"></a>2. Super Netflix</h3><p><strong>Web browsers:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-netflix/iakpdiefpdniabbekcbofaanjcpjkloe" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Super Netflix is yet another reliable extension to add subtitles to Netflix. Apart from adding custom subtitles, this extension allows you to change the video playback speed. Like Substital, the Super Netflix extension on Chrome Web Store also has 100K+ users.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can help you avoid spoilers by blurring images and episode descriptions.</li>
<li>You can use the extension to skip intros automatically.</li>
<li>Offers 5 different video modes.</li>
<li>You get the option to change the Netflix streaming server.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Netflix-SubStyler-customize-subtitles"><a href="#3-Netflix-SubStyler-customize-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="3. Netflix SubStyler: customize subtitles"></a>3. Netflix SubStyler: customize subtitles</h3><p><strong>Web browsers:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-substyler-customi/ggfifegigcpgkkpnpfbglofhnjcjmidd#:~:text=Netflix%20SubStyler%20%3A%20customize%20subtitles&text=Extension%20to%20customize%20captions%20and,by%20customizing%20Netflix%20subtitle%20style." >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Unlike the other two extensions mentioned above, Netflix SubStyler only allows you to change the styling of subtitles on Netflix. However, the thing that makes this extension worthy of your attention is that it comes loaded with several customization options.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose a custom text color for the subtitles either with the help of an in-built color picker or by entering the RGB value of the color.</li>
<li>The extension lets you add text outlines and change the size of the text.</li>
<li>You can even add a text background and change its color and opacity.</li>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-3D-Gifs-in-Videos-More-Textured-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-3D-Gifs-in-Videos-More-Textured-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured"></a>Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured</h2><p>You can use GIF makers to create loops in videos you upload but the trick to making your 3D GIF stand out is about to be explained in the following.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color grading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

<h4 id="3-Use-Highlights-and-Shadows-adjustment"><a href="#3-Use-Highlights-and-Shadows-adjustment" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment"></a>3. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment"></a>4. Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment</h4><p>Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.</p>
<p>Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.</p>

Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity"></a>5. Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity</h4><p>Even though you can change your footage to black and white using the hue and saturation functionality, the black and white tool gives you more control.</p>
<p>This functionality feature can make your footage blend with the soft light part. Besides, it is best to first lower the contrast of your image or video to black and white to be able to highlight the unclear parts.</p>

Use levels to unveil the whites, blacks, and mids of an image"></a>6. Use levels to unveil the whites, blacks, and mids of an image</h4><p>Levels is a functionality feature that displays the blacks, whites, and mids of footage. With this functionality, you can make the highlight parts lighter and the shadows appear darker, which is essential in making cinematic videos.</p>
<p>In the levels histogram, the left slider defines the darkest part, the right defines the brightest part, and the top defines distributions.</p>
<p>In software such as Adobe After Effects, you can set this functionality to automatic or customize it based on your preference.</p>

Use Vibrance to control other levels of saturation"></a>7. Use Vibrance to control other levels of saturation</h4><p>The saturation of video footage or a clip can be regulated using vibrance functionality. With vibrance, you can alter the saturation levels of your clip while simultaneously minimizing clippings for the colors to approach complete saturation.</p>
<p>When you want to use this functionality in After Effects, you drag and drop it right on top of your footage – The exact part you want to apply it.</p>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color grading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-6"><a href="#In-this-article-6" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-2"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-2" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-2"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-2"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-2"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-2"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-2"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-3"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-2"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-3"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-3"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-3"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-3"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-4"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-4" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-3"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment</h4><p>Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.</p>
<p>Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Remove-the-Background-of-a-Photo-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Remove-the-Background-of-a-Photo-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint"></a>Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint</h2><p>If there is anything that a designer hates in his precious photo, then it’s the background. It hides and distracts from the main subject at hand. You can use various photo editing tools to remove the background from PNG images or JPG. However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the image in a new tab</p>
<p>Launch PowerPoint on your desktop or Mac and change the layout of the slide to “Blank”. Next, insert your image, which has a solid or high-contrast background. Such pictures are easier to transform and edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import picture powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Select the “Remove Background” option</p>
<p>Click on your image to get the “Picture Format” in the menu toolbar. On the left top side, choose the “Remove Background” option. Now, PowerPoint will try to remove the background automatically. If the final picture that you are getting is not satisfactory, move to the next step.</p>

                      alt="click remove background powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Area</p>
<p>From the given options in the toolbar, mark the areas that you want to keep or remove in the final result. As you can view, how some parts of the pictures have been cut. So, spread the box to cover the entire area of the image, which you want to keep. Remember, purple-highlighted areas are removed automatically.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>If you want to ensure a better result, use the cursor. Start hovering over the background and the main subject to get the plus and minus sign. These signs are useful for getting a precise image at the end. The Minus sign allows you to mark the areas to be removed. The plus sign can be used to keep the marked areas in the final picture.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finishing Touches</p>
<p>Check your image carefully and see whether any area is left to be removed or not. You can zoom in to find the tiniest spot. When you are satisfied with every detail, click anywhere outside of the image to stop further edits. Congratulations! Your transparent PNG is ready to save. Go to “File”&gt;”Save As” and find the option to save your picture in PNG transparent format.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-JPG-to-Transparent-PNG"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-JPG-to-Transparent-PNG" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG"></a>Part 2 How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG</h2><p>Ever wondered how logos in a graphic match with the background image color? It’s possible with transparent PNG images only. The transparent PNG images format contains superior quality and no background. Hence, it is pretty helpful for the designers to add them to graphics and videos.</p>
<p>In case you have some JPG images but you want it in PNG images format, don’t worry. You can use Kapwing as it’s a trusted content creation and video editing platform. It can bring your idea to life. It can convert JPG to PNG transparent easily. With the AI-powered facility, you can enjoy a seamless editing and conversion experience. Kapwing makes it really simple and fast, but the best part is that you can get it done for free.</p>
<p>Step 1: Add Your JPG</p>
<p>Launch Kapwing in any browser of your choice. Log in using your account or sign up with a new one. Now, you will be redirected to the Kapwing studio, where you can do all the editing and conversion. Upload your image to the “Kapwing Studio” and use the “Remove Image from Background” tool.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="kapwing interface"
                ></p>
<p>If the image is already saved on your device, simply hit “Click to Upload” or, if you wish, drag and drop the JPG image to initiate the conversion. On the other hand, in case the image is not available, you can copy and paste from a URL in the “Paste an image or video URL” box.</p>
<p>Step 2: Pick a Tool</p>
<p>After the image upload finishes, the next thing is to start removing its background. Go to the right side of the “Image” tab and click on the “Erase” button. Otherwise, you can use the “Remove Background from Image” tool to start.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="pick the tool kapwing"
                ></p>
<p>You have two options to choose from – Erase and Magic Wand. The first tool gives you full control over what you want to remove or keep. Adjust the “eraser size” by sliding right on the dial. This way, you can remove the background precisely.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Magic Wand tool is amazing for removing a particular area at once. You can remove the picture background in less time and effort. If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the “Erase” tool.</p>
<p>For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose “Move” to select the pixels you want to remove.</p>
<p>Step 3: Make the PNG and Download</p>
<p>After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click “Done” and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features. You can add watermarks, text, and a lot more. Finally, hit the “Publish” button placed at the top right and “Download” to save the PNG file to your desktop.</p>

It hides and distracts from the main subject at hand. You can use various photo editing tools to remove the background from PNG images or JPG. However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the image in a new tab</p>

These signs are useful for getting a precise image at the end. The Minus sign allows you to mark the areas to be removed. The plus sign can be used to keep the marked areas in the final picture.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finishing Touches</p>

When you are satisfied with every detail, click anywhere outside of the image to stop further edits. Congratulations! Your transparent PNG is ready to save.

To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the “Erase” tool.</p>
<p>For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose “Move” to select the pixels you want to remove.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not an easy job to convert JPG to transparent PNG using PowerPoint, especially when an image contains multiple images and colors. For such pictures, you can use Kapwing. It has plenty of additional features that you can use for creative work.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> If you have any questions or have different ways of accomplishing this, feel free to comment below. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline. Now, trim the music to 30 seconds and listen to the end part. Select the last note to match the beat in the beginning part of the music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-1.jpg"
                      alt="match note with the music"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use “M” from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg"
                      alt="add markers and adjust video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-3.jpg"
                      alt="create widescreen cinemascope bar opener"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-4.jpg"
                      alt="match length of whole video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: After the animation is completed, head to the “Titles” tab and look for cinematic packs. Choose one and drag it onto the timeline. Secondly, alter the duration and animation of the title. The user is expected to insert a dissolve transition at the end of the title.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-5.jpg"
                      alt="adjust title of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the “Effects” tab to blur the video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg"
                      alt="add dissolve transition and effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the “Animation” and then “Customize.” Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the “Scale” percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!</p>

                      alt="include subtitle across video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: After that, duplicate the subtitle track on the timeline and repeat the required changes. Sync the text to the audio once you are done with the process.</p>

                      alt="duplicate subtitles"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: The user is instructed to go back to the “Titles” section and search “cinematic end credits.” Pick one and drag it to the third track. Double click on it to make a few alterations. You have performed the procedure successfully.</p>

It compels the audience to keep following you.</p>
<p>For this very reason, the article conveys a guide to creating a powerful cinematic intro. Let us begin this!</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline. Now, trim the music to 30 seconds and listen to the end part. Select the last note to match the beat in the beginning part of the music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match note with the music"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use “M” from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add markers and adjust video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create widescreen cinemascope bar opener"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match length of whole video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: After the animation is completed, head to the “Titles” tab and look for cinematic packs. Choose one and drag it onto the timeline. Secondly, alter the duration and animation of the title. The user is expected to insert a dissolve transition at the end of the title.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adjust title of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the “Effects” tab to blur the video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add dissolve transition and effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the “Animation” and then “Customize.” Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the “Scale” percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!</p>

<p>Step 5: After the animation is completed, head to the “Titles” tab and look for cinematic packs. Choose one and drag it onto the timeline. Secondly, alter the duration and animation of the title. The user is expected to insert a dissolve transition at the end of the title.</p>

<p>Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the “Animation” and then “Customize.” Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the “Scale” percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!</p>

<p>If you are a professional video or image creator, you know what aspect ratio is and why aspect ratio is important. Even people passionate about their cameras and visual art enthusiasts know it. If you are a newbie, Let us make it easy for you. This article will talk about the vertical phone aspect ratio ratio, its definition, types, iPhone vertical video dimensions, etc. We’ll also provide you solid tips on mobile vertical video size and how to create phone vertical videos easily. Let’s jump into the topic and see what you can learn.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                      alt="5 to 4 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="16 to 9 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="9:16 Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>
<p><img

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-1"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-1" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-1"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-1" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-1"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-1" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-1"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-1" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-1"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-1"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-1"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-1"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-1"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-1"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-2"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-2" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-2"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-2" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-2"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-2" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3 to 2 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                      alt="5 to 4 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="9:16 Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-2"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-2" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-2"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-2"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-2"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-2"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-2"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-3"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-3" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>

<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-3"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-3"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-3" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                      alt="1 to 1 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3 to 2 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                      alt="5 to 4 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="9:16 Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-3"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-3" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-3"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-3"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-3"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-3"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-3"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p>Follow the step-by-step guide to merge videos using Photos App on Windows 10:</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Lauch-the-Photos-App"><a href="#Step-1-Lauch-the-Photos-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Lauch the Photos App"></a>Step 1: Lauch the Photos App</h3><p>You might wish to put all of the films or photographs you want to merge into one folder on your computer before going to the Photos app. It will aid in the speeding up of the entire procedure.</p>
<p>Type ‘Photos’ into your computer’s search bar, then click on the program that appears.</p>

<p>Launching the editor mode directly from the photo if you’re using photos in your video project is also possible. In that case, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your file in the Photos app</li>
<li>Select Edit &amp; Create</li>
<li>Select Create a movie with text from the drop-down menu.</li>

<p>You can name the project by typing it in the name tab in the top left corner of your screen. Then, by clicking the pencil icon next to your project’s name, you can alter your title at any moment.</p>

<p>The tool will automatically combine all of your files into a single video. Then, you can alter the video order in the Storyboard and edit them.</p>
<p>Go to your Project Library and drag all of the files you added to the video editor into the Storyboard section to get started on your project.</p>

<h3 id="Step-6-Add-Text"><a href="#Step-6-Add-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Add Text"></a>Step 6: Add Text</h3><p>You can add text to your video project using the Windows video editor, but there aren’t many font styles to choose from. You’ll also have to add and optimize your text for each clip separately, which isn’t the most time-efficient approach.</p>
<p>To add text to your clips, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose Text</li>
<li>Select the small box icon on the clip you want to add text to</li>
<li>In the empty box, type the text you wish to add.</li>

<ul>
<li>Open your file in the Photos app</li>
<li>Select Edit &amp; Create</li>
<li>Select Create a movie with text from the drop-down menu.</li>

<p>You can name the project by typing it in the name tab in the top left corner of your screen. Then, by clicking the pencil icon next to your project’s name, you can alter your title at any moment.</p>

<p>The tool will automatically combine all of your files into a single video. Then, you can alter the video order in the Storyboard and edit them.</p>
<p>Go to your Project Library and drag all of the files you added to the video editor into the Storyboard section to get started on your project.</p>

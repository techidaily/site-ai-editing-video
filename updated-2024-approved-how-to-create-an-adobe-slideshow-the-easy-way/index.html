<h2 id="What-Is-Fortnite"><a href="#What-Is-Fortnite" class="headerlink" title="What Is Fortnite?"></a>What Is Fortnite?</h2><p>Fortnite is a popular online game developed by the American game studio Epic Games. The video game was released in 2017, and it’s available in three-game mode versions with the same game engine and gameplay. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortnite: Save the World: Set on contemporary Earth, Save the World is a co-op hybrid third-person shooter (TPS), tower defense (TD), and survival game. The game allows a maximum of four players to fight off creatures that look like zombies and defend objects with traps or fortifications they have built.</li>
<li>Fortnite Battle Royale: This is a free-to-play (F2P) battle royale video game that allows up to one hundred players to fight against each other until only one person remains.</li>
<li>Fortnite Creative: Released in 2018, Fortnite Creative allows players to create battle arenas and worlds. They can then share these predetermined structures with up to 16 other players for a range of multiplayer game modes that have customizable rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its release, Fortnite has become a worldwide phenomenon, with more than 350 million people playing the game across the globe. In the first year of Fortnite’s release, players downloaded its mobile version 78 million times.</p>
<p>The game became such a global hit because it’s free to play. It’s also available on most gaming platforms and features an engaging theme. Additionally, because Battle Royale allows up to 100 gamers to fight it out until they find the last man standing, this means the replayability of this online video game is infinite. What’s more? Each game is unique.</p>
<p>Fortnite has also become popular because users can purchase DLC (downloadable content) to enhance their gaming experience.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Anime-Movie-Q-A-3"><a href="#Part-3-Anime-Movie-Q-A-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Anime Movie Q&amp;A"></a>Part 3 Anime Movie Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the main reasons behind the uniqueness of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>Anime flicks boast of having the capability to entertain the audience with an element of uniqueness, owing to a series of characteristics. Some of the prominent ones are, complex and engaging storylines, exaggeration of physical features and a light tint of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What makes anime movies rank high on viewer preference?</strong></p>
<p>Amine movies are a storehouse of fantasy and adventure, taking you to an imaginary world of nail-biting stories. Making a more generous use of narration and vision, in comparison to live action flicks, they tend to unfold the content plot in such a way that suits the animation genre ahead of any other style.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Which movie marked the entry of anime flicks into the entertainment world?</strong></p>
<p>Namakura Gatana, also referred to as Blunt Sword, was directed in 1917. The latter was then released in Japan as the inaugural anime movie sometime later. However, the fact that which of the two titles took the actual credit, still happens to be a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the fundamental classification of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>As of now, the aforesaid Japanese animation style is classified into 5 major categories, each aimed at addressing a specific class of viewer preferences. The 5 types are, Kodomomuke, Josei, Seinen, Shojo and Shonen.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the existing count of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>According to the latest updates, the cumulative count of anime movies is ahead of 6000 at present. Additionally, around 3200 anime series have been telecasted till date. It is further, interesting to know that Japan takes the credit of making more than 60% of the total anime content being viewed across the globe.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-11"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-11" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Anime movies 2020 are a trend of fantasy and fiction that takes you to a superficial world of fun-filled adventure and entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The never-ending list of wholesome anime movies extends every year in proportion with the increasing popularity earned by these amazing motion graphic creations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> While there are already a host of anime flicks for movie lovers to crave for, the coming year is all set to bring in new surprises with some amazing content releases.</p>

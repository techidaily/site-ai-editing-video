<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fire up wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="proceed to hide the first track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-3.jpg"
                      alt="click the effect button"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-4.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-5.jpg"
                      alt="unhide the first track"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/tree-with-clear-background.gif"
                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-away-from-the-tree.gif"
                      alt="film the subject walking from one side of the tree"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import the clip on filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/jump-in-front-of-camera.gif"
                      alt="tell your subject to walk to the marker"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import the clip into filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="customize the clip with a mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="double-click the video track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="unhide the first track on the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That was easy, right? Playing around with Filmora’s masking tools can create incredible masking illusions like the ones we’ve discussed. And don’t forget this video editor has many more creative possibilities. You should try these masking tricks!</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>

<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That was easy, right? Playing around with Filmora’s masking tools can create incredible masking illusions like the ones we’ve discussed. And don’t forget this video editor has many more creative possibilities. You should try these masking tricks!</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="film the subject walking from one side of the tree"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tell your subject to walk to the marker"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import the clip into filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="customize the clip with a mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="double-click the video track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

<p><strong>What is a Political Campaign Video?</strong></p>
<p>A political campaign video is quite similar to other forms of marketing videos. As a political candidate, you are the product, and the cause you’re promoting is your unique selling proposition. A political video helps to promote your cause to the voters. When entering into politics, political campaigns are one of the things you would need to learn how to do. It is the best way to get your message out to the voters. A political video informs the people about who you are, your values, and why you’re the best person to vote for. Your political video needs to be captivating, but more importantly, you need it to be informative and succinctly capture your spirit.</p>
<p>According to an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/us-political-ad-spending-to-hit-record-high/" >eMarketer report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, political ad spending has increased by 63.3%. Political ad spending on TV has increased by 82%. However, political videos go beyond TV as the best videos go viral organically on social media. There are several other video channels where you can also share your video. One thing is clear; political videos aren’t going anywhere, and if you’re exploring this path, you need to learn how to make one. Creating an effective political campaign video is essential, and the next section informs you how you can get it done.</p>
<p><strong>4 Political Campaign Video Ideas to Consider</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of political campaign video ideas. It all depends on your target audience and the cause you’re promoting. This section will provide you with four effective pollical campaign videos you can implement in your next political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-4.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is another idea you can implement for your political video. You can hold a Q&amp;A session on an Instagram story or any other platform that allows you to make a live stream. Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-5.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is an excellent idea for political campaign videos because it allows you to connect with a community better. Videos that focus on a community are an effective method of communicating with the community. You can request community members who support your campaign to feature in your video and share their views. It makes it easier for voters to connect with you because they will relate to their stories. Even better, your viewers might recognize some of the faces you use, promoting loyalty to your cause. Your campaign video will show how it affects everyday lives by engaging a community.</p>
<p>Attack political videos are also quite popular and involve a candidate who speaks negatively of another candidate. However, according to research, it is best to avoid such political videos as they have minimal effect on voter turnout. Additionally, it could backfire and affect you in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>How to Make a Political Campaign Video</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have four ideas you could utilize for your next political video; you’re probably wondering how you can go about it. Follow the steps outlined in this article to make an engaging and excellent political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Set Goals</strong></p>
<p>Before you begin making a political campaign video, you need to set the goals you want to achieve. What is the outcome you want from your video? Do you really want to get your name out there, and just how many people you are hoping to achieve that? Is the goal of the video to raise donations, or do you just want to remind people to vote?</p>
<p>Once you decide what you’re looking to get out of the video, you can now make the best decision regarding content, format, and the metrics you want to measure. You can also set SMART goals that will motivate you to achieve the goals you set for the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Decide Your Target Audience</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the goals you want to achieve, you can then decide who you’re looking to get your video in front of. For example, if your goal is raising money, then you can create a political video that speaks to politically engaged people in your political party.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: What is Your Main Style and Message</strong></p>
<p>With the target audience decided and the goal in mind, create a message in a style you think is compelling and engaging. An example is using the Q&amp;A political video idea to provide more details about you and your cause that voters do not know already. When you’re looking to effectively get your name out there, you have to draw focus to your story. Start the video off strong so that people don’t get bored and exit the video.</p>
<p>You can ensure that your video offers different content from your popular marketing material. Let it be new but ensure you use the same brand element, so your viewers still know it is you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Create Your Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>Once you create the storyboard for your video, it makes it much easier for the production process to go smoothly. Plan the script in advance and also decide the visuals you would like. Planning helps you find out the resources you will need for the video. Additionally, you can use different storyboarding tools to plan the details of your political video.</p>
<p>At this point, you can choose to ask for external help to ensure everything goes as planned. For example, you could work with marketing experts or a political ad agency. Such external support has the experience and support to take your political campaign video to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Produce Your Political Campaign Video</strong></p>
<p>Now that everything needed is in place, it’s time to shoot your video. The equipment required usually depends on the style you’re looking to achieve. If you’re shooting the phone on your own, you need good lighting and a phone to pass your message successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Edit Video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>You don’t want to put out a video that doesn’t look professional and isn’t optimized. A shabby-looking or improperly formatted video will draw attention from the content of the political video. Therefore, you have to use a professional editing tool like Wondershare Filmora to edit your political video. This app is relatively easy to use; its intuitive user interface allows you to navigate the app even when you have no prior editing experience.

<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>
<p><img

Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>What is a Political Campaign Video?</strong></p>
<p>A political campaign video is quite similar to other forms of marketing videos. As a political candidate, you are the product, and the cause you’re promoting is your unique selling proposition. A political video helps to promote your cause to the voters. When entering into politics, political campaigns are one of the things you would need to learn how to do. It is the best way to get your message out to the voters. A political video informs the people about who you are, your values, and why you’re the best person to vote for. Your political video needs to be captivating, but more importantly, you need it to be informative and succinctly capture your spirit.</p>
<p>According to an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/us-political-ad-spending-to-hit-record-high/" >eMarketer report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, political ad spending has increased by 63.3%. Political ad spending on TV has increased by 82%. However, political videos go beyond TV as the best videos go viral organically on social media. There are several other video channels where you can also share your video. One thing is clear; political videos aren’t going anywhere, and if you’re exploring this path, you need to learn how to make one. Creating an effective political campaign video is essential, and the next section informs you how you can get it done.</p>
<p><strong>4 Political Campaign Video Ideas to Consider</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of political campaign video ideas. It all depends on your target audience and the cause you’re promoting. This section will provide you with four effective pollical campaign videos you can implement in your next political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-4.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is another idea you can implement for your political video. You can hold a Q&amp;A session on an Instagram story or any other platform that allows you to make a live stream. Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-5.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is an excellent idea for political campaign videos because it allows you to connect with a community better. Videos that focus on a community are an effective method of communicating with the community. You can request community members who support your campaign to feature in your video and share their views. It makes it easier for voters to connect with you because they will relate to their stories. Even better, your viewers might recognize some of the faces you use, promoting loyalty to your cause. Your campaign video will show how it affects everyday lives by engaging a community.</p>
<p>Attack political videos are also quite popular and involve a candidate who speaks negatively of another candidate. However, according to research, it is best to avoid such political videos as they have minimal effect on voter turnout. Additionally, it could backfire and affect you in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p>
<p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p>
<p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing"></a>Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p>
<p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li>

How Does Ray Tracing Work?</h2><p>Ray Tracking uses the process of denoising. The algorithm starts with the camera and traces the shades of shadows and lights.</p>
<p>Ray Tracing uses machine learning to fill in the gaps to form a realistic image. The brighter the scene, the higher the graphics quality; the higher the quality, the more expensive it is. This is why Ray Tracing didn’t become popular in the video game industry until recently.</p>

Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects</h2><p>After the introduction of Ray Tracing, we will combine it with a popular video editor - Adobe After Effects to see how it works. Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool for creating visual effects and animated graphics. Adobe introduced Ray Tracing or <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> feature in After Effect to help graphic designers create photorealistic 3D images and render light and shadow. This feature was added in 2012 with the release of After Effects CS 6.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does It Work"></a>How Does It Work</h3><p>3D Ray Tracing in After Effects works by giving your text and paths more depth. Extruded layers have a z-axis depth, making them three-dimensional. This extra dimension is viewable from all angles, even when the layer is rotated. In contrast, non-extruded layers have zero depth on the z-axis. So, they will disappear if you try to rotate them 90 degrees on the x or y-axis.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p>
<p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p>
<p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p>

Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="History-1"><a href="#History-1" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p>
<p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-1"><a href="#Advantages-1" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-aliasing And Depth Of Field:</strong> Ray Tracing can help you quickly get the anti-aliasing and depth of field effects.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Easy-Way-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect"><a href="#Easy-Way-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Easy Way to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect"></a>Easy Way to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect</h2><p>No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.</p>
<p>All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="What Is Green Screen Technique?"></a>What Is Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.</p>
<p>Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Green Screen Technique?"></a>Why Use Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.</p>
<p>You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?"></a>How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?</h2><p>If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.</li>
<li>A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.</li>
<li>External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Making videos with DIY green screen stand is no more an esoteric concept. You can set it up anywhere and start shooting video. The magic begins in the post-production stage where you can use Wondershare Filmora to replace the green screen with video effects that will blow the mind of your viewers and followers. Filmora has intuitive options and controls through which you can apply green screen effect in simple steps.</p>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>

<ul>

Safety and privacy aspects are some of them. If you’re looking to blur out a bystander or cut out profanities from your video with Filmora, this is the right article for you.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-add-a-beep-sound-to-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-add-a-beep-sound-to-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora"></a>Part 1. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora</h2><p>Filmora’s powerful video editing menu includes easy tweaking on audio. You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.</p>
<p>Step1 Create a new project and import the video to Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-1.jpg"
                      alt="import the video to filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Separate the audio component from the video by right-clicking on the video and selecting the Detach Audio option. You can now edit each of them individually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="detach the audio component"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Mark the part to place the start of the beep using the playhead and click the Split icon on the editor’s toolbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split to separate the target segment"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Place the playhead at the end of the censored segment and click Split. Double-click on the segment to open the audio editing menu, then you can remove that part of the audio or lower the volume.</p>

How to add mosaic to video with Filmora"></a>Part 2. How to add mosaic to video with Filmora</h2><p>Whether you want to hide a passerby’s face or your own, or even other types of objects, Wondershare Filmora is ready to take on the task. While its nifty face-off function automatically follows the movement of a marked face, the mosaic effect is the fast and perfect solution for a static object in the video.</p>
<p>Step1 After importing a video to Filmora, tap on the Effects tab and find the Mosaic filter from the gallery.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="find the mosaic effect from the effects library"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag the Mosaic filter to the timeline just above the main video track.</p>

                      alt="drag the mosaic effect to timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 A yellow box will appear in the viewer. You can drag and adjust its size to hide the targetted object. You can also adjust the opacity and intensity of the effect using the adjustment menu, accessible when you double-click the yellow box.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adjust the mosaic effect"
                ></p>
<p>If the targetted object moves, you can set the automatic tracking before adding the mosaic filter by clicking on the <strong>Motion Tracking</strong>&gt;<strong>Start Tracking</strong> located above the timeline. Before you place the filter, preview and adjust the tracking frame to ensure tight proof censor.</p>

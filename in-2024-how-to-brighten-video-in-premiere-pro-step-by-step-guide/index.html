A lot of times, you’ll get a video file that was shot in low light, and it will make your subject look dark and underexposed. Video brightness is an important feature that is easy to adjust.

<h3 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h3><p>In the effect control panel under the Unsharp mask, set the amounts, radius, and threshold to enhance the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="enhance video in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can increase the values of these parameters too high, but you will end up with a distorted video. Try increasing the values by small increments and see what happens. Avoid increasing the “amount” and radius value beyond 100% and ten, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="Step-2-10"><a href="#Step-2-10" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h3><p>Effects tab can be found in the left-most panel of adobe premiere pro. Click the Effects tab and search for Lightning effects in the search bar and click on it.</p>

                      alt="enhance video in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Step-2-11"><a href="#Step-2-11" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h3><p>In the effect control panel under the Unsharp mask, set the amounts, radius, and threshold to enhance the video.</p>

<h2 id="How-To-Create-A-YouTube-Intro"><a href="#How-To-Create-A-YouTube-Intro" class="headerlink" title="How To Create A YouTube Intro"></a>How To Create A YouTube Intro</h2><p>Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It’s a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.</p>
<p>However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.</p>
<h2 id="1-Keep-your-intro-brief"><a href="#1-Keep-your-intro-brief" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your intro brief"></a>1. Keep your intro brief</h2><p>The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.</p>
<p>Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don’t have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.</p>
<h2 id="2-Stay-in-the-theme"><a href="#2-Stay-in-the-theme" class="headerlink" title="2. Stay in the theme"></a>2. Stay in the theme</h2><p>While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won’t be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.</p>
<p>Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you’ll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.</p>
<h2 id="3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count"><a href="#3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count" class="headerlink" title="3. Make the first 7 seconds count"></a>3. Make the first 7 seconds count</h2><p>Although branding is important, it won’t guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don’t provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.</p>
<p>Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.</p>
<p>Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn’t yours or if it’s obvious that you’re not interested in the subjects you raise.</p>
<h2 id="4-Make-a-plan"><a href="#4-Make-a-plan" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a plan"></a>4. Make a plan</h2><p>The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don’t divide them up into manageable portions, you’ll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.</p>
<p>One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don’t necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.</p>
<h2 id="5-Include-a-Call-To-Action"><a href="#5-Include-a-Call-To-Action" class="headerlink" title="5. Include a Call-To-Action"></a>5. Include a Call-To-Action</h2><p>Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won’t get as a content creator if you don’t ask, and this also applies to YouTube.</p>
<p>After you’ve written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.</p>
<p>Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you’ll come out as uncertain of your goal.</p>
<h2 id="6-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#6-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="6. Keep it simple"></a>6. Keep it simple</h2><p>It’s simple to assume that more is better when creating a YouTube channel. However, if you’re just starting out, the opposite is typically true.</p>
<p>Make a thorough inventory of everything you could include before putting together your YouTube intro. After you’ve written down everything you can think of, pick down the one or two most crucial elements.</p>
<p>You’ll save a lot of time by making your YouTube intro simpler. Additionally, it will make your channel feel more cohesive.</p>
<h2 id="7-Create-a-stunning-intro"><a href="#7-Create-a-stunning-intro" class="headerlink" title="7. Create a stunning intro"></a>7. Create a stunning intro</h2><p>For the majority of producers, creating a successful YouTube channel takes years of trial and error. A perfectionist attitude will hold you back in the beginning, especially when it comes to your introduction.</p>
<p>Make a YouTube opening that’s decent enough to get you started rather than aiming to create something ideal. You can adjust as needed as your talents advance and your understanding of the path you want to go in deepens.</p>

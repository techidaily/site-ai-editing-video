A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage.

<p>The images can be alternatively added to the timeline by selecting the required ones from the iOS device’s Photo Booth or iPhoto account.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>

When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

Adhering to the concern, let us see through the process of <strong>making a slideshow in iMovie</strong> through a detailed, step by step guide in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create Video Slideshow in iMovie</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Install the Program</strong></p>
<p>To <strong>create slideshow with iMovie</strong>, start with visiting the home website of the iMovie video editor program and proceed to download the software in your desired iOS system for free. Next in the line is the installation process, which you need to complete in order to successfully launch the application in your system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Open a New Project</strong></p>
<p>In the app’s welcome screen, navigate to and click on the ‘File’ tab in the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top. From the dropdown menu that follows, select the ‘New Project’ option to start working on a new slideshow. You can alternatively, press the ‘+ N’ command keys from your device keyboard to launch a new project. Once your project file is created, assign it a suitable name and select a desired aspect ratio.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create the First Slide</strong></p>
<p>The inaugural slide of your presentation is generally consists of the slideshow the title, which you can add by clicking on the ‘Title’ icon under the ‘Preview’ box, to see a variety of text customization choices appear within the editor workspace.</p>
<p>To work with adding titles to a slide, choose a preferred text style; followed by navigating to the ‘Events Pane’ and dropping the same within the first dotted frame box. You can edit the text in the blue box above the first frame. The amount of text you can add depends on the size of the box. To change the length of the box, click on the same to drag it to a desired place and finally include the text in the ‘Preview’ box.</p>
<p>Navigate to and hit the ‘Show Fonts’ button to customize the added text in terms of color, fonts, style and size. Tap the ‘Preview Slide’ button to see the applied changes and click on ‘Done’ to confirm the same. You can repeat the above process to add titles and informative banners to all the slides within the slideshow presentation that you are about to create.</p>

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Designing the Title Slide"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Include Still Images</strong></p>
<p>Browse through the locally saved images within your device gallery and add the desired ones at a specific point in the editor timeline using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage. Do not close the image folder in your device until you have imported all the stills.</p>
<p>The images can be alternatively added to the timeline by selecting the required ones from the iOS device’s Photo Booth or iPhoto account. All you need to do is navigate to and hit the ‘Photo’ button to drop the selected images in the ‘Photos’ box at the bottom right corner of the software workspace.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-video-slideshow-in-imovie-3.JPG"
                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Adding Images to the Presentation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-video-slideshow-in-imovie-4.JPG"
                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Adding Background Music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Share Your Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Run a mock slideshow in the ‘Preview’ box to ensure that every element of the presentation is at its specified place. When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

The added music clip in ’Blue’ will detach to appear as an independent clip in ‘Green’ within the software timeline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Fade Audio In and Out</strong></p>

To introduce a gradual fade in or out effect, drag the round button to the center of the video clip.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Include Transitions</strong></p>

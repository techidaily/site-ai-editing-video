<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>

<h4 id="In-this-article-6"><a href="#In-this-article-6" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-2"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-2" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-2"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-2"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-2"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-2"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-2"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-3"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-2"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment</h4><p>Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.</p>
<p>Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.</p>

Therefore, it can be hard sometimes to choose the right GoPro video editor for Mac. However, you’ll need to consider factors before making your choice. Here are some of these factors.</p>
<p><strong>Level of Expertise</strong></p>
<p>This is a vital factor you should put into consideration before choosing a GoPro video editor. As a beginner, you wouldn’t need a GoPro editor that offers complex editing functions that you can’t use. Also, as a professional, you shouldn’t go for an editor that lacks the necessary editing tools to meet your editing needs. As an editor, you should totally be on the lookout for an editor that supports both beginners and professionals. This will remove the need to search for a new video editor at any experience level.</p>
<p><strong>Interface</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>nother factor to consider is the user interface of your chosen video editor. When you go for a more friendly user interface, you will be saving yourself the time to get familiar with the software. Is the video editor free or paid? Regardless of the answer, check out the user interface before choosing one.</p>
<p><strong>Formats</strong></p>
<p>You also need to ensure that the editing software doesn’t limit you to specific video formats. You should go for a GoPro video editor that supports the common and trendy video formats. This will allow you to convert your edited videos when you need to share them.</p>
<p>Now, most free GoPro video editors offer just limited features to users, limiting your editing course. Furthermore, most paid GoPro video editors focus on a professional level, making it difficult for new editors to use. Therefore, you should totally opt for a GoPro video editor that succinctly supports all your editing needs.</p>

<p>VideoProc Vlogger is the best GoPro editor for anyone looking for speed adjustment. The video editor uses visualized speed ramping to alter the speed throughout a clip. This program contains over 20-speed features to help you quickly change the tone and tempo of your GoPro video. Furthermore, VideoProc Vlogger is beginner-friendly with a lot of advanced editing features. These features include automatic keyframes and flexible Bezier curves to slow parts of a video without splitting it.</p>
<p>This free GoPro video editor can simulate motion roll, dolly, tilt, and even truck effects. You can also push in and out and stylize your video clips with rotation, fast zooms, and shakes. With VideoProc Vlogger, you fix grain video, remove fish-eye, extract audio and apply motion crops to your video. The video editor is best at creating new motion trails to change the action of the video.</p>
<p>Although VideoProc Vlogger is a free video editor, it definitely lacks some advanced editing features. For example, you can edit your videos without the annoying ads or watermarks. In addition, the video editor is designed for beginners, content creators, and hobbyists as it lacks features like video stabilization. So while the video editor is not for professionals, it’s worth trying out.</p>

Therefore, it can be hard sometimes to choose the right GoPro video editor for Mac. However, you’ll need to consider factors before making your choice. Here are some of these factors.</p>
<p><strong>Level of Expertise</strong></p>
<p>This is a vital factor you should put into consideration before choosing a GoPro video editor. As a beginner, you wouldn’t need a GoPro editor that offers complex editing functions that you can’t use. Also, as a professional, you shouldn’t go for an editor that lacks the necessary editing tools to meet your editing needs. As an editor, you should totally be on the lookout for an editor that supports both beginners and professionals. This will remove the need to search for a new video editor at any experience level.</p>
<p><strong>Interface</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>nother factor to consider is the user interface of your chosen video editor. When you go for a more friendly user interface, you will be saving yourself the time to get familiar with the software. Is the video editor free or paid? Regardless of the answer, check out the user interface before choosing one.</p>
<p><strong>Formats</strong></p>
<p>You also need to ensure that the editing software doesn’t limit you to specific video formats. You should go for a GoPro video editor that supports the common and trendy video formats. This will allow you to convert your edited videos when you need to share them.</p>
<p>Now, most free GoPro video editors offer just limited features to users, limiting your editing course. Furthermore, most paid GoPro video editors focus on a professional level, making it difficult for new editors to use. Therefore, you should totally opt for a GoPro video editor that succinctly supports all your editing needs.</p>

<p>VideoProc Vlogger is the best GoPro editor for anyone looking for speed adjustment. The video editor uses visualized speed ramping to alter the speed throughout a clip. This program contains over 20-speed features to help you quickly change the tone and tempo of your GoPro video. Furthermore, VideoProc Vlogger is beginner-friendly with a lot of advanced editing features. These features include automatic keyframes and flexible Bezier curves to slow parts of a video without splitting it.</p>
<p>This free GoPro video editor can simulate motion roll, dolly, tilt, and even truck effects. You can also push in and out and stylize your video clips with rotation, fast zooms, and shakes. With VideoProc Vlogger, you fix grain video, remove fish-eye, extract audio and apply motion crops to your video. The video editor is best at creating new motion trails to change the action of the video.</p>
<p>Although VideoProc Vlogger is a free video editor, it definitely lacks some advanced editing features. For example, you can edit your videos without the annoying ads or watermarks. In addition, the video editor is designed for beginners, content creators, and hobbyists as it lacks features like video stabilization. So while the video editor is not for professionals, it’s worth trying out.</p>

Therefore, it can be hard sometimes to choose the right GoPro video editor for Mac. However, you’ll need to consider factors before making your choice. Here are some of these factors.</p>
<p><strong>Level of Expertise</strong></p>
<p>This is a vital factor you should put into consideration before choosing a GoPro video editor. As a beginner, you wouldn’t need a GoPro editor that offers complex editing functions that you can’t use. Also, as a professional, you shouldn’t go for an editor that lacks the necessary editing tools to meet your editing needs. As an editor, you should totally be on the lookout for an editor that supports both beginners and professionals. This will remove the need to search for a new video editor at any experience level.</p>
<p><strong>Interface</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>nother factor to consider is the user interface of your chosen video editor. When you go for a more friendly user interface, you will be saving yourself the time to get familiar with the software. Is the video editor free or paid? Regardless of the answer, check out the user interface before choosing one.</p>
<p><strong>Formats</strong></p>
<p>You also need to ensure that the editing software doesn’t limit you to specific video formats. You should go for a GoPro video editor that supports the common and trendy video formats. This will allow you to convert your edited videos when you need to share them.</p>
<p>Now, most free GoPro video editors offer just limited features to users, limiting your editing course. Furthermore, most paid GoPro video editors focus on a professional level, making it difficult for new editors to use. Therefore, you should totally opt for a GoPro video editor that succinctly supports all your editing needs.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the default arrangements, you can also proceed to make adjustments in the transition play duration and even customize a transition style of your own with text and effects.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Adjust Your Image Properties</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>

                ></p>

You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>

You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Collage Creation</strong></p>
<p>Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>
<p>Move ahead with expanding the collage, to ensure a proper display of the images. You can further, apply selected transitions to the created collage under the latter’s ‘Object Settings’.</p>

<p><strong>Step 12: Edit Your Collage</strong></p>
<p>Start with selecting the first image of your collage and adjusting its size in the ‘Layout Designer’ through the position frame at the edges of the photo. Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Absence in Control Panel</strong></p>

This leads to the unavailability of troubleshooting methods and settings adjustments, in case the program encounters a problem while running.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Incomplete Removal</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest glitches with the software is that you possibly can never uninstall it completely, because some of the latter’s associated processes and software file traces tend to remain forever on your system, causing interference with the working of other programs.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Issues of File Processing</strong></p>
<p>The preset uninstallation package often fails to run or process a particular file which is necessary for uninstalling the program. The running process may often not initiate or stop midway, hence causing users enough discomfort to move towards getting rid of the program.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Processing Errors</strong></p>
<p>Often during the uninstallation process, you may encounter a series of processing errors leading to unsuccessful installation of most of the important files, which causes the leash over of partially deleted program files, barging your system’s memory with unusable data and irrelevant information.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Startup Prevention</strong></p>
<p>It may be a common instance to notice that the program refrains from being completely uninstalled due to some different program installed in your device. The allied program may interfere with the uninterrupted running of the Aquasoft uninstallation program.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>

<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>

You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>

To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>

Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>

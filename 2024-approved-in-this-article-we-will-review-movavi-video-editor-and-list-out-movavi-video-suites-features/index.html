You can edit a video as you create it. As you start and stop your video, your videos are going to be automatically ‘stitched’ together.

<p>Similarly, if you’re not happy with how the video turned out, you can select the backspace button to delete the video on the app. Now let’s dive into the TikTok Video ratios that will make your videos shine.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Stability is the key here, as the captured videos will be masked and combined in the later stages of the steps. To do so, consistently capturing the video in the same ratio is necessary. You can stabilize the video with a simple gorilla pod that you can get of good quality or a simple tripod.</p>
<h3 id="The-prop"><a href="#The-prop" class="headerlink" title="The prop"></a>The prop</h3><p>The prop will be the object that we will be flying in the video. It could be a fluffy toy, a ball, a box, or anything you desire to be flying in your video.</p>

<h3 id="Good-presentation"><a href="#Good-presentation" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to capture the footage?"></a>Part 2. How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video"><a href="#Reference-video" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif"
                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video"><a href="#Main-video" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/main-video.gif"
                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You can speed up your video and slow it down.</li>
<li>For now, we will have to slow it down.</li>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>
<h5 id="Step4Add-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step4Add-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step4Add the masking effect"></a>Step4Add the masking effect</h5><p>Now that we have our video aligned with the reference video we are using. Let’s move to the next step.</p>
<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora effect editing panel"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>
</ul>

You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Good-presentation-1"><a href="#Good-presentation-1" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>

How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video-1"><a href="#Reference-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video-1"><a href="#Main-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>

<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect-1"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>
</ul>

<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>

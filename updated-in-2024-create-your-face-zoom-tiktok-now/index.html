                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you have added the video for editing, navigate into the “Effects” section and find yourselves in the “Visuals” section. Let the cursor of the video be at the point where the facial features are prominent, and you wish to face zoom the video from there. With the cursor across the required place, find the “Zoom” effect in the list and hold the button until you’ve successfully added the effect across the required length of the video.</p>

Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, <em>you will not be able to rotate the clip</em>. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.</p>
<p>Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.</p>
<h3 id="TIPS-FOR-WINDOWS-MEDIA-PLAYER"><a href="#TIPS-FOR-WINDOWS-MEDIA-PLAYER" class="headerlink" title="TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER"></a><strong>TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER</strong></h3><p>In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.</p>
<p>While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.</p>
<p>To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on Organize.</li>
<li>Then move onto Manage Libraries</li>
<li>Now click on Videos.</li>

<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>For individuals who prefer to obscure their surroundings while on a video conversation, Zoom’s blur background function is helpful. The function was added to the video-conferencing app in 2021 and has since gained popularity. The greatest thing you can do is choose a blur out backdrop if you can’t determine which of our Zoom background categories would best fit the video chat occasion. These are impartial backdrops that don’t necessarily depict any particular environment. They only provide a lovely, unobtrusive background that will take away any possible obstructions during the video connection. Perhaps a professional setting might be too much for a particular video chat, whilst a humorous backdrop wouldn’t work. In this situation, a blurred picture backdrop will be the difference between putting little to no effort into your call and being ready to portray yourself in the best possible way.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step3The backdrop of a picture or video added from your gallery using the Add icon will likewise successfully blur the background on your Zoom Android device. Now place Zoom calls as usual, and the backdrop of your live video will be automatically blurred.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>For individuals who prefer to obscure their surroundings while on a video conversation, Zoom’s blur background function is helpful. The function was added to the video-conferencing app in 2021 and has since gained popularity. The greatest thing you can do is choose a blur out backdrop if you can’t determine which of our Zoom background categories would best fit the video chat occasion. These are impartial backdrops that don’t necessarily depict any particular environment. They only provide a lovely, unobtrusive background that will take away any possible obstructions during the video connection. Perhaps a professional setting might be too much for a particular video chat, whilst a humorous backdrop wouldn’t work. In this situation, a blurred picture backdrop will be the difference between putting little to no effort into your call and being ready to portray yourself in the best possible way.</p>

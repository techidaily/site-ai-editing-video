You edit and color-correct your video project only to find out that the final product is not what you expected. The contract and colors dramatically shift when viewed on a different device. In most cases, this is caused by improperly calibrated monitors, but it could also be your eyes playing tricks on you. <strong>Video scopes</strong> help in preventing this problem ensuring that the color in your video is consistent across devices. With video editing scope, you get the exact representation of the elements that make up your image, including lightness and color values. In this article, we explain what video scopes are and how you can use them in your editing projects.</p>

Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them"></a><strong>Part 1. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them</strong></h2><p>When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.</p>

<p>Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Accuracy</strong>: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Editing</strong>: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.</li>
<li><strong>Matching Color Between Shots</strong>: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.</p>

Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones"></a><strong>Part 2. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones</strong></h2><p>Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#scope1">Waveform Scopes</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope2">Histogram</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope3">RGB Parade</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope4">Vector Scopes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Waveform-Scopes"><a href="#1-Waveform-Scopes" class="headerlink" title="1. Waveform Scopes"></a><strong>1. Waveform Scopes</strong></h3><p>Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="2-Histogram"><a href="#2-Histogram" class="headerlink" title="2. Histogram"></a><strong>2. Histogram</strong></h3><p>The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="3-RGB-Parade"><a href="#3-RGB-Parade" class="headerlink" title="3. RGB Parade"></a><strong>3. RGB Parade</strong></h3><p>This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.</p>

<h3 id="4-Vector-Scopes"><a href="#4-Vector-Scopes" class="headerlink" title="4. Vector Scopes"></a><strong>4. Vector Scopes</strong></h3><p>This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.</p>

Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them"></a><strong>Part 1. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them</strong></h2><p>When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.</p>

<p>Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Accuracy</strong>: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Editing</strong>: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.</li>
<li><strong>Matching Color Between Shots</strong>: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.</p>

Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones"></a><strong>Part 2. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones</strong></h2><p>Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#scope1">Waveform Scopes</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope2">Histogram</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope3">RGB Parade</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope4">Vector Scopes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Waveform-Scopes-1"><a href="#1-Waveform-Scopes-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Waveform Scopes"></a><strong>1. Waveform Scopes</strong></h3><p>Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.</p>

<h3 id="2-Histogram-1"><a href="#2-Histogram-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Histogram"></a><strong>2. Histogram</strong></h3><p>The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.</p>

<h3 id="3-RGB-Parade-1"><a href="#3-RGB-Parade-1" class="headerlink" title="3. RGB Parade"></a><strong>3. RGB Parade</strong></h3><p>This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.</p>

<h2 id="Detailed-Tutorial-to-Merge-Videos-in-VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#Detailed-Tutorial-to-Merge-Videos-in-VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="Detailed Tutorial to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player"></a>Detailed Tutorial to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player</h2><p>Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.</p>
<p>One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It’s not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good “player” as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.</p>
<p>Before we move on to video streaming, let’s look at two features that we can use in VLC player:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw" >Rotate a video in VLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don’t know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects &amp; Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M" >Cut&#x2F;trim video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don’t want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and&#x2F;or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem “without any problem” - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer’s My Video folder.</p>

<p> In the Profile, it is desirable to specify the following format: Video -  + MP3 (MP4), and below you can choose the Destination file - the location where you want to save the merged video.

<p>That’s it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It’s not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good “player” as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.</p>
<p>Before we move on to video streaming, let’s look at two features that we can use in VLC player:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw" >Rotate a video in VLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don’t know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects &amp; Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M" >Cut&#x2F;trim video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don’t want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and&#x2F;or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem “without any problem” - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer’s My Video folder.</p>

This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s" >step by step <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Technique one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open VLC media player.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Probably, you have already decided exactly which files you want to merge, so choose Open Multiple Files…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the opened window, click on Add in the File tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-4.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Select the desired clips from the newly opened window (selecting order matters, because it dictates which clips will come first and which ones will be next in the finished version), then click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-5.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Step two:</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected videos are shown in the File Selection list. At the bottom of the window, click the Arrow button next to the Play button, where you need to select Convert.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-6.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p> In the Profile, it is desirable to specify the following format: Video -  + MP3 (MP4), and below you can choose the Destination file - the location where you want to save the merged video. Also, to find the edited video easily, check the following: Append ‘-converted’ to file name. Click on Start. Wait until it is done - then you can play the video.</p>
<p><img

<p>That’s it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It’s not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good “player” as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.</p>
<p>Before we move on to video streaming, let’s look at two features that we can use in VLC player:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw" >Rotate a video in VLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don’t know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects &amp; Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M" >Cut&#x2F;trim video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don’t want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and&#x2F;or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem “without any problem” - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer’s My Video folder.</p>

This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s" >step by step <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Technique one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open VLC media player.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Probably, you have already decided exactly which files you want to merge, so choose Open Multiple Files…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the opened window, click on Add in the File tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-4.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Select the desired clips from the newly opened window (selecting order matters, because it dictates which clips will come first and which ones will be next in the finished version), then click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Step two:</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected videos are shown in the File Selection list. At the bottom of the window, click the Arrow button next to the Play button, where you need to select Convert.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p> In the Profile, it is desirable to specify the following format: Video -  + MP3 (MP4), and below you can choose the Destination file - the location where you want to save the merged video. Also, to find the edited video easily, check the following: Append ‘-converted’ to file name. Click on Start. Wait until it is done - then you can play the video.</p>

<p>That’s it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!</p>
<p>Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It’s not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good “player” as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.</p>
<p>Before we move on to video streaming, let’s look at two features that we can use in VLC player:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw" >Rotate a video in VLC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don’t know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects &amp; Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M" >Cut&#x2F;trim video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don’t want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and&#x2F;or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem “without any problem” - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer’s My Video folder.</p>

This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s" >step by step <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Technique one:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step one:</li>
</ul>
<p>Open VLC media player.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Probably, you have already decided exactly which files you want to merge, so choose Open Multiple Files…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>In the opened window, click on Add in the File tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-4.jpg"
                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Select the desired clips from the newly opened window (selecting order matters, because it dictates which clips will come first and which ones will be next in the finished version), then click Open.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Step two:</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected videos are shown in the File Selection list. At the bottom of the window, click the Arrow button next to the Play button, where you need to select Convert.</p>
<p> <img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge videos in vlc"
                ></p>
<p> In the Profile, it is desirable to specify the following format: Video -  + MP3 (MP4), and below you can choose the Destination file - the location where you want to save the merged video. Also, to find the edited video easily, check the following: Append ‘-converted’ to file name. Click on Start. Wait until it is done - then you can play the video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Anime-Movie-Q-A-3"><a href="#Part-3-Anime-Movie-Q-A-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Anime Movie Q&amp;A"></a>Part 3 Anime Movie Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the main reasons behind the uniqueness of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>Anime flicks boast of having the capability to entertain the audience with an element of uniqueness, owing to a series of characteristics. Some of the prominent ones are, complex and engaging storylines, exaggeration of physical features and a light tint of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What makes anime movies rank high on viewer preference?</strong></p>
<p>Amine movies are a storehouse of fantasy and adventure, taking you to an imaginary world of nail-biting stories. Making a more generous use of narration and vision, in comparison to live action flicks, they tend to unfold the content plot in such a way that suits the animation genre ahead of any other style.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Which movie marked the entry of anime flicks into the entertainment world?</strong></p>
<p>Namakura Gatana, also referred to as Blunt Sword, was directed in 1917. The latter was then released in Japan as the inaugural anime movie sometime later. However, the fact that which of the two titles took the actual credit, still happens to be a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the fundamental classification of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>As of now, the aforesaid Japanese animation style is classified into 5 major categories, each aimed at addressing a specific class of viewer preferences. The 5 types are, Kodomomuke, Josei, Seinen, Shojo and Shonen.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the existing count of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>According to the latest updates, the cumulative count of anime movies is ahead of 6000 at present. Additionally, around 3200 anime series have been telecasted till date. It is further, interesting to know that Japan takes the credit of making more than 60% of the total anime content being viewed across the globe.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Anime movies 2020 are a trend of fantasy and fiction that takes you to a superficial world of fun-filled adventure and entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The never-ending list of wholesome anime movies extends every year in proportion with the increasing popularity earned by these amazing motion graphic creations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> While there are already a host of anime flicks for movie lovers to crave for, the coming year is all set to bring in new surprises with some amazing content releases.</p>

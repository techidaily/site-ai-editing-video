That’s when knowing “how to edit TXT file and save it as SRT file” would come in handy.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can edit the TXT file without using any external software and online tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you’re using a Windows computer, then you can open your TXT document in Microsoft Notepad. For a Mac computer, you can use TextEdit. On the very first line of the document, type a number to identify the subtitle’s section. Each section indicates an individual subtitle, which could be a sound or one sentence from a dialogue.</li>
<li>The next line would be the timestamp of the subtitle. <em>Timestamp</em> follows this formatting: <em>hours: minutes: seconds, milliseconds.</em></li>
<li>In the next line, write your caption.</li>
<li>Now add double space between the next section and write it as you did for the previous section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you’ve formatted the TXT file to use it as a subtitle file, let’s save it .SRT format. Here’s how to save your file as .SRT:</p>
<p>1. Go to the File tab and select Save as.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save as srt file with notepad"
                ></p>
<p>2. Now, save the document with a .**SRT** extension.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-txt-to-srt-15.jpg"
                      alt="edit the save as type option to save txt to srt file"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the advantage of converting TXT file to SRT manually is that it does not require tools and is free, but it does have disadvantages.

That’s when knowing “how to edit TXT file and save it as SRT file” would come in handy.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can edit the TXT file without using any external software and online tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you’re using a Windows computer, then you can open your TXT document in Microsoft Notepad. For a Mac computer, you can use TextEdit. On the very first line of the document, type a number to identify the subtitle’s section. Each section indicates an individual subtitle, which could be a sound or one sentence from a dialogue.</li>
<li>The next line would be the timestamp of the subtitle. <em>Timestamp</em> follows this formatting: <em>hours: minutes: seconds, milliseconds.</em></li>
<li>In the next line, write your caption.</li>
<li>Now add double space between the next section and write it as you did for the previous section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you’ve formatted the TXT file to use it as a subtitle file, let’s save it .SRT format. Here’s how to save your file as .SRT:</p>
<p>1. Go to the File tab and select Save as.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save as srt file with notepad"
                ></p>
<p>2. Now, save the document with a .**SRT** extension.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-txt-to-srt-15.jpg"
                      alt="edit the save as type option to save txt to srt file"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Part-3-Anime-Movie-Q-A-3"><a href="#Part-3-Anime-Movie-Q-A-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Anime Movie Q&amp;A"></a>Part 3 Anime Movie Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the main reasons behind the uniqueness of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>Anime flicks boast of having the capability to entertain the audience with an element of uniqueness, owing to a series of characteristics. Some of the prominent ones are, complex and engaging storylines, exaggeration of physical features and a light tint of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What makes anime movies rank high on viewer preference?</strong></p>
<p>Amine movies are a storehouse of fantasy and adventure, taking you to an imaginary world of nail-biting stories. Making a more generous use of narration and vision, in comparison to live action flicks, they tend to unfold the content plot in such a way that suits the animation genre ahead of any other style.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Which movie marked the entry of anime flicks into the entertainment world?</strong></p>
<p>Namakura Gatana, also referred to as Blunt Sword, was directed in 1917. The latter was then released in Japan as the inaugural anime movie sometime later. However, the fact that which of the two titles took the actual credit, still happens to be a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the fundamental classification of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>As of now, the aforesaid Japanese animation style is classified into 5 major categories, each aimed at addressing a specific class of viewer preferences. The 5 types are, Kodomomuke, Josei, Seinen, Shojo and Shonen.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the existing count of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>According to the latest updates, the cumulative count of anime movies is ahead of 6000 at present. Additionally, around 3200 anime series have been telecasted till date. It is further, interesting to know that Japan takes the credit of making more than 60% of the total anime content being viewed across the globe.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Anime movies 2020 are a trend of fantasy and fiction that takes you to a superficial world of fun-filled adventure and entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The never-ending list of wholesome anime movies extends every year in proportion with the increasing popularity earned by these amazing motion graphic creations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> While there are already a host of anime flicks for movie lovers to crave for, the coming year is all set to bring in new surprises with some amazing content releases.</p>

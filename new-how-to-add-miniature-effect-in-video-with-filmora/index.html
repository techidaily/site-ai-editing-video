                ></p>
<p>But first, let’s learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.</p>
<p>However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we’re seeing is actually a tiny model.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg"
                      alt="a miniature effect for landscape"
                ></p>
<p>To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It utilizes <strong>selective blur</strong> to make things appear like <strong>small</strong></li>
<li>The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from <strong>a high angle</strong>.</li>
<li>The tiny effect is usually used in <strong>drone footage, time lapses</strong>, or <strong>landscape photography</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can’t get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:</p>

<li>While the <strong>object is far</strong> from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.</li>
<li>Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the same stock video clip a <strong>third time</strong> on the third video track of the timeline.</li>
<li>Then add a mask in a <strong>Rectangle</strong> shape on the building.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>blur</strong> the edge of this mask.</li>

It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Difference-Between-AI-Video-Recognition-and-Facial-Recognition-3"><a href="#Part-2-Difference-Between-AI-Video-Recognition-and-Facial-Recognition-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?</strong></h2><p><strong>Video recognition AI</strong> primarily focuses on comprehending the information or data received from many video feeds, frame by frame. It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

<p>Here are some exciting things you can do using LumaFusion:</p>
<h4 id="●-Enjoy-a-Simplified-SSD-and-Cloud-Storage-Importing-Process"><a href="#●-Enjoy-a-Simplified-SSD-and-Cloud-Storage-Importing-Process" class="headerlink" title="● Enjoy a Simplified SSD and Cloud Storage Importing Process"></a>● Enjoy a Simplified SSD and Cloud Storage Importing Process</h4><p>One of the best things about LumaFusion is your ability to import from SSD and cloud storage seamlessly. If you’re using an external SSD for playback media, this feature will excite you. LumaFusion automatically imports media from your SSD whenever you add video clips to the timeline. There’s no need to waste time importing media by yourself.</p>
<h4 id="●-Switch-Between-Six-Workspace-Layouts"><a href="#●-Switch-Between-Six-Workspace-Layouts" class="headerlink" title="● Switch Between Six Workspace Layouts"></a>● Switch Between Six Workspace Layouts</h4><p>LumaFusion features six workspace layouts. So you can choose whatever one works best for the project you are working on. With the layout button, you can scramble the source viewer, browser, and timeline to your preference. LumaFusion also gives you the option of viewing the content in portrait or landscape modes. It’s a truly customizable and advanced multitrack video editing app for everyone who loves ease.</p>
<h4 id="●-Access-Seamless-Final-Cut-Pro-Exporting"><a href="#●-Access-Seamless-Final-Cut-Pro-Exporting" class="headerlink" title="● Access Seamless Final Cut Pro Exporting"></a>● Access Seamless Final Cut Pro Exporting</h4><p>Do you work with Final Cut Pro X? Then there’s exciting news for you. Lumafusion allows you to export specific project files so that you can work on the NLE. Even though this feature is only available for a fee, it offers excellent value for its $20 price. You can hardly have it cheaper with other NLEs.</p>
<h4 id="●-Leverage-Its-Intuitive-UI-UX"><a href="#●-Leverage-Its-Intuitive-UI-UX" class="headerlink" title="● Leverage Its Intuitive UI&#x2F;UX"></a>● Leverage Its Intuitive UI&#x2F;UX</h4><p>This is no hoax—LumaFusion’s intuitive design will blow your mind.

<h4 id="●-Enjoy-the-Automated-Audio-Ducking-Feature"><a href="#●-Enjoy-the-Automated-Audio-Ducking-Feature" class="headerlink" title="● Enjoy the Automated Audio Ducking Feature"></a>● Enjoy the Automated Audio Ducking Feature</h4><p>Audio ducking involves temporarily lowering a specified audio signal’s volume when another one comes up. Having to do this manually can be tiring. Fortunately, with LumaFusion’s automatic audio ducking feature, you don’t have to worry about that anymore. All you need to do is assign speakers and music tracks as master and auto track. The audio ducking feature takes it up from there.</p>

This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.</p>
<p>With color grading, you can adjust your video’s color balance, saturation, contrast, luminance, black level, etc. It helps to evoke the particular emotions or moods that you want your videos to exude.</p>
<p>These are the essential things to note about color grading in LumaFusion:</p>
<h4 id="1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading"><a href="#1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?"></a>1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>

<h2 id="Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Video"><a href="#Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Video" class="headerlink" title="Best Frame Rate for 4K Video"></a>Best Frame Rate for 4K Video</h2><p>People in the videography ad filmmaking world use complicated terminology like Ultra High Def to describe 4K videos. Even though you are not a complete stranger to the term 4K, you might still be unaware of what it means.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, 4K is the highest resolution you can watch your movies and videos. The details are incredibly crisp, meaning you can see pimples or the pores on an actor’s face through the screen. However, the frame rate will significantly affect how you enjoy a 4K video. Therefore, it would be wise to learn how to choose the ideal frame rate to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Keep reading this article to learn more about frame rates and which is suitable for a 4K video.</p>

<h2 id="How-Do-Frame-Rates-Affect-Video-Viewing"><a href="#How-Do-Frame-Rates-Affect-Video-Viewing" class="headerlink" title="How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?"></a>How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?</h2><p>The motion will appear smoother if your video contains more frames per second. Even though your viewers are not tech-savvy, they will definitely notice the difference.</p>
<p>Consider a video of a duck drinking water from a pond. If you film and playback the same video in 24, 30, and 60fps, you will see a noticeable difference, assuming your shutter speed is set according to the 180-degree shutter rule.</p>
<p>If you are filming quicker motions of wildlife and birds, you are better off sticking to higher resolutions to give the viewer a pleasant experience and ensure the motion is fluid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lower frame rates like 24fps are ideal for human movements, which are not as smooth as wildlife. Suppose you used 60fps for a cinematic film or a TV show. The video would look a bit odd because that is not how we see things in the natural world. In addition, your viewers aren’t used to such smoothness.</p>
<h2 id="Viewing-Requirements-of-4K-Videos"><a href="#Viewing-Requirements-of-4K-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos"></a>Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos</h2><p>You may have heard about 4K videos and wondered what people mean by that term. In simple terms, a 4K video is a high-resolution video that is four times the usual 1080p HD video. When it comes to 4K videos, there are two standard resolutions. One of them is the standard for Digital Cinema which is 4096*2160 pixels. The other is for television and is 3840*2160 pixels.</p>
<p>To stream 4K content, you need a bandwidth between 10 and 20 Mbps. On the other hand, streaming platforms like Netflix require higher bandwidths of not less than 15 Mbps. In addition to the bandwidth we mentioned earlier, you need a 4KTV or 4K monitor.</p>
<p>This specification was brought up at the UHD Alliance, a union of more than 50 tech companies working together to support 4K content. Tech companies ought to ensure the devices they produce are compatible with 4K videos, which are becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Below is a list of requirements any electronic device should fulfill before being termed a 4KTV or 4K monitor.</p>

<ul>
<li>A resolution of not less than 3840*2160.</li>
<li>A 10-bit color depth that allows for 1,024 shades of red, yellow, and blue.</li>
<li>A high dynamic range for color accuracy.</li>
<li>An excellent combination of black level and peak brightness. The peak brightness should not exceed 1,000 nits, and the black level shouldn’t go below 0.5 nits. Alternatively, the peak brightness shouldn’t exceed 540 nits; neither should the black level plummet below 0.0005 nits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Video-1"><a href="#Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Frame Rate for 4K Video"></a>Best Frame Rate for 4K Video</h2><p>We all know that the frame rate you choose for your video will significantly impact the viewer’s experience and the overall style of your video. The frame rate will also affect how the video looks. For instance, a frame rate lower than 24fps will make your video look unprofessional and of poor quality. The content will also flicker because there aren’t many still images per second.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a lower FPS causes the file size to be smaller, causing it to consume a lower bandwidth. The vice versa is also true. Now that you understand these facts, you might wonder which frame rate would be best for your 4K videos.</p>
<p>Research reveals that the most acceptable frame rate is 30fps and 60fps. This is because the motion will appear natural to the human eye without being too fast or unrealistic.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what is the best frame rate for 4k videos, we urge you to select 60fps because it contains more detail. The higher frame rate also makes the motion look very smooth and crisp. Perhaps you want to shoot a slow-motion video. In that case, an even higher frame rate of 120fps would be ideal.</p>

However, it is not a straightforward process either. There are numerous moving parts that ought to work harmoniously for your video to turn out perfect and guarantee your audience will have a pleasant viewing experience. Before we dive into choosing the best frame rate for your 4K videos, let’s help you understand the filmmaking process.</p>
<p>Most filmmakers and videographers see it fit to shoot videos in 120p or 4K. This step makes their work easier during the editing process. If the raw footage is in 4K, they can de-emphasize or retain specific plot points that would look great in the final video. However, not everyone is shooting a video for Hollywood. Therefore, shooting in 4K on your laptop for your YouTube channel might be difficult.</p>
<p>Below are some factors you should consider when choosing the best frame rate for a 4k video.</p>

<h4 id="File-size"><a href="#File-size" class="headerlink" title="File size"></a>File size</h4><p>Shooting your video at a higher frame rate means more still images are packed into a single second of the video. Therefore, you will end up with a larger file size. If you want to shoot a video for your YouTube channel, it would be wise to stick to a smaller frame rate.</p>
<h4 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h4><p>It wouldn’t make sense to shoot a talking head video at more than 24fps. However, a higher frame rate would be ideal for a travel vlog, where the details need to be crisp.</p>
<h4 id="Medium-of-delivery"><a href="#Medium-of-delivery" class="headerlink" title="Medium of delivery"></a>Medium of delivery</h4><p>The standard frame rate for television is 24fps. On the other hand, it would be best to stick to a higher frame rate of 60fps if you intend to shoot content for the silver screen.</p>
<h4 id="Motion-in-the-video"><a href="#Motion-in-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Motion in the video"></a>Motion in the video</h4><p>Lastly, the movement within the video will play a massive role in the frame rate you choose. The faster the motion, the higher the frame rate needs to be. For instance, action movies don’t do well in frame rates of less than 60 fps.</p>

It’s time to start brainstorming ideas. You can do it alone or with the help of your team. But remember that you have to think out of the box to make it creative.</p>
<h5 id="Step3Consider-the-lyrics-and-message"><a href="#Step3Consider-the-lyrics-and-message" class="headerlink" title="Step3Consider the lyrics and message"></a>Step3Consider the lyrics and message</h5><p>In the planning stage, it is also important to consider the lyrics and message of the song.

<h2 id="Choose-a-style-for-your-music-video"><a href="#Choose-a-style-for-your-music-video" class="headerlink" title="Choose a style for your music video"></a>Choose a style for your music video</h2><p>While creating ideas for the music video, it’s also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="1-Performance-style-music-video"><a href="#1-Performance-style-music-video" class="headerlink" title="1.Performance-style music video"></a>1.Performance-style music video</h3><p>If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.</p>
<h3 id="2-Narrative-style-music-video"><a href="#2-Narrative-style-music-video" class="headerlink" title="2.Narrative-style music video"></a>2.Narrative-style music video</h3><p>A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.</p>
<p>You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="treatment of the plan"
                ></p>
<p>If the artist approves the direction of the video, it’s time to move on to storyboarding!</p>
<h2 id="Storyboard-your-music-video"><a href="#Storyboard-your-music-video" class="headerlink" title="Storyboard your music video"></a>Storyboard your music video</h2><p>Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding!

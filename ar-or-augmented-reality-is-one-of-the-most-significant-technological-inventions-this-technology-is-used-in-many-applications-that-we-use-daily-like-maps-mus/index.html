<p>Suppose you want to buy a pair of eyeglasses and don’t know which pair would suit your look. Now you might wish to look at how your face would look on different frames. Here you can use AR and see which pair of glasses would fit you using AR. AR can be used to share and receive various kinds of tacit knowledge. Augmented Reality is often synonymously used for “Computed-mediated reality” and “Mixed- Reality.”</p>
<p>Despite such an exceptional concept, many users raised questions about the privacy issues of this app. AR technology constantly needs to record the real environment, which involves real human beings. Recording their movement breaches their privacy which can cause legal trouble for the user. If the videos are recorded with consent, they will not harm anyone.</p>

This process involves an experience where the real or physical world interweaves with virtually created objects. It interweaves so perfectly that the artificial seems a part of the natural.

It helps by refreshing all the memories of a trip, function, and more in a single frame.</p>
<p>They have gained huge popularity in the last few years as the digital space has grown. You may have already seen social media users posting their photo collages on their timelines. Instagram is far ahead of the competition in this regard. It has played a crucial role in establishing the photo collage as a normal trend.</p>
<p><strong>For the photographer</strong></p>
<p>With a photo collage, a photographer can best showcase his talent. It shows that you can do a lot more than your capabilities, like representing stories by blending colors and elements perfectly. This will help you attract your prospects and convert them into your paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>How do photo collages provide value to the clients?</strong></p>
<p>A photo collage provides visual value to the clients by enhancing the creative process. It can have a profound effect on the way they perceive your art of photography. In fact, your clients will love to see all their memories collected in an attractive photo collage. There are a lot of people that even love to present collages to their loved ones.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

<p>Now, you can narrate your story with incredible text and title templates in this full-featured video editor. It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="print module"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="template browser"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Insert Photos</strong></p>
<p>After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.</p>

The real struggle is in creating the collage. That takes a bit more time, but it’s worth it in the end.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong>You can follow any of the above steps to get your desired photo collage. So now, you can reduce your burden with Adobe Lightroom or Wondershare Filmora .</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-2"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>

                      alt="print module"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>

                      alt="template browser"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Insert Photos</strong></p>
<p>After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.</p>

<h2 id="02-Canva"><a href="#02-Canva" class="headerlink" title="02 Canva"></a>02 Canva</h2><p>Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a <strong>picture collage with music</strong></p>
<p>Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)</p>

It is available as an online tool and as a <strong>photo collage with music</strong> <strong>app</strong> that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.</p>

By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety</p>
<p>It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>

<p>Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free <strong>music photo collage</strong> tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.</p>

<h3 id="Edit-Beyond-Basic-with-AI-Video-Editing-Features-of-Filmora-1"><a href="#Edit-Beyond-Basic-with-AI-Video-Editing-Features-of-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Edit Beyond Basic with AI Video Editing Features of Filmora"></a>Edit Beyond Basic with AI Video Editing Features of Filmora</h3><p>This part of the article will highlight some of the prominent video editing features of Filmora. The uniqueness of these features lies in their AI-backed algorithms. You can give directions according to your video, and AI will operate accordingly. Here are some of its video editing features that you’ll come across upon entering:</p>
<h4 id="1-Remove-Background-1"><a href="#1-Remove-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Remove Background"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Remove Background <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>With this feature of Filmora, you can remove the background of your videos and images. The AI-integrated technology preserves the object while removing the background. In addition, you can add a solid color, gradient, or custom background for it.</p>
<h4 id="2-Auto-Reframe-1"><a href="#2-Auto-Reframe-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Auto Reframe"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Auto Reframe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Creating reels for Instagram or crafting YouTube shorts has some requirements. To preserve the integrity and visuals of content, it is important to fit a video. With this AI, you can set the required frame resolution. Along with that, it preserves the pixel quality of the video while resizing the frame.</p>
<h4 id="3-AI-Smart-Masking-1"><a href="#3-AI-Smart-Masking-1" class="headerlink" title="3. AI Smart Masking"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >AI Smart Masking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Filmora offers multiple mask options to infuse effects and filters to specific parts. However, the V13 upgrade introduced an AI masking feature for improved results. By enabling this feature, you can choose to mask objects or backgrounds.</p>
<h4 id="4-AI-Thumbnail-Creator-1"><a href="#4-AI-Thumbnail-Creator-1" class="headerlink" title="4. AI Thumbnail Creator"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >AI Thumbnail Creator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Thumbnails increase video views by evoking the audience’s interest in seeing a video. In Filmora, you can employ the AI Thumbnail creator to auto-create thumbnails. It analyzes the best frame out of your video and chooses it as a thumbnail. You can further apply many templates to this thumbnail according to context.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article has expanded your knowledge and expertise about two powerful video editors. With <strong>how to slow down video in After Effects</strong>, we introduced you to the software. There is no limitation of features in either software as both bring out the best in videos.</p>
<p>However, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as it is a more accessible alternative. Creating a slow-mo in this software is easier and requires no effort. In addition, you can also access its built-in effects and presets for task productivity.</p>

What is Motion Blur Effects</h2><p>Let’s start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren’t aware of it since our brains “edit” it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.</p>
<p>Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer’s animation.</p>
<p>These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.</p>

It doesn’t matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects’ slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.</p>
<p>Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You’ll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:</strong></p>
<p>So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur’s magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.</p>
<p>Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn’t already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose “New Project” to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose “Effects &amp; Presets.” A search bar will appear as a result. Enter “CC Force Motion Blur” in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.</p>

<p>Step3 Next, drag the “CC Force Motion Blur” to the layers that represent your imported video at the bottom left of the screen. On the left side of the screen, under “CC Force Motion Blur,” you will find settings for motion blur. Here, you may change the motion blur to suit your needs. You may type in the values and watch the video as appropriate. There are several choices available for you to modify.</p>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before applying any speed effects, first trim your film to the proper length. Once the speed effects have been included, you need also make sure that your composition is lengthy enough for your clip. Once you’re satisfied with the footage you want to slow down, choose one of the ways—Time warp or Time Stretch.</p>
<p>Step4 Customize “Shutter Angle” and “Motion Blur Samples.” Always be careful to preview the video after any modifications. Adjust to your needs and specifications. Additionally, if you wish, you may add any additional effect to the video. When finished, save the video by selecting “File” in the upper left corner.</p>

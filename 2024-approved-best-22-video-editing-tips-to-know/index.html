<li>Compression rate, bit depth, bit</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of data the camera records each second is referred to as bit rate. Every single second of a video is subject to significant data processing by cameras. The higher the quality of the video, the more is the bit rate. Bit depth refers to the number of colors your camera can read per pixel. Common bit depths are 8-bit and 10-bit, which enable a camera to read 256 million or 1.07 billion colors respectively. To upload your edited video, a compression is usually required to convert your resolution to internet quality so that the upload can be made simpler, without distorting the video resolution.</p>

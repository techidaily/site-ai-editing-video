            <h2 id="Create-Promotional-Video"><a href="#Create-Promotional-Video" class="headerlink" title="Create Promotional Video"></a>Create Promotional Video</h2><p>When it comes to executing video marketing campaigns, there’s an unspoken rule that holds true no matter what your goals are. Ready for it? A great video is only as good as the brand behind it. Branding is a crucial aspect of any successful video marketing campaign because your audience needs to believe in your product or service before they will invest their time and money in you. If you want to make a real impact with your promotional videos, branding should be at the top of your mind.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-Branding"><a href="#What-is-Branding" class="headerlink" title="What is Branding"></a>What is Branding</h2><p>When you think of branding, what comes to mind? Maybe it’s your favorite pair of shoes or a piece of clothing with a logo on it. Or maybe you think about big companies with catchy slogans and memorable commercials that have been around for years. But branding isn’t just about logos and slogans—it’s so much more than that.</p>
<p>Branding is the process of creating an identity for your product or service that differentiates itself from others in its category. This can be as simple as coming up with a name for your company, or it could mean developing an entire brand strategy that encompasses every aspect of how you present yourself to the world (and potential customers). Branding is all about finding ways to stand out from other businesses in your industry by establishing trust with consumers through consistency across all channels, including social media, websites, advertising campaigns, and more.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Branding-is-Important"><a href="#Why-Branding-is-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why Branding is Important"></a>Why Branding is Important</h2><p>Branding is vital for any business. It’s the foundation of your brand and it sets up a strong structure for your business to grow on.</p>
<p>Branding helps to build trust and loyalty with customers, which is crucial to gaining new customers and retaining old ones.</p>
<p>If you want people to remember you, then branding is important because it makes sure people will never forget about you!</p>
<p>With great branding comes great responsibility in terms of communicating clearly who you are as a company, what kind of products&#x2F;services that you provide or sell, how those products&#x2F;services will benefit consumers (or clients), etc., so make sure these things are always clear when designing promotional videos meant specifically for marketing purposes.</p>
<h2 id="Branding-in-Video-Marketing"><a href="#Branding-in-Video-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Branding in Video Marketing"></a>Branding in Video Marketing</h2><p>Branding is an important part of video marketing because it helps to create a memorable video.</p>
<p>You should make sure you have a clear understanding of your brand before you start creating promotional videos. Your brand is the personality that people associate with your business or company, and this will help them to remember you.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re selling food products related to health and fitness, then having a healthy lifestyle theme throughout all aspects of the production process will be essential to getting people excited about what they see in their minds when they think about your product or service.</p>
<p>It can be challenging to keep track of all the aspects of your brand, but you can use Brand Guidelines to make sure that everything is aligned with your goals and values.</p>
<h2 id="About-Video-Brand-Guidelines"><a href="#About-Video-Brand-Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="About Video Brand Guidelines"></a>About Video Brand Guidelines</h2><p>Video brand guidelines are a set of rules and regulations that govern how your videos should look, feel and sound. By having these in place, you can maintain a consistent style and tone across all your video content, whether that be explainer videos or social media posts.</p>
<h2 id="Why-do-you-need-Video-Brand-Guidelines"><a href="#Why-do-you-need-Video-Brand-Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Why do you need Video Brand Guidelines"></a>Why do you need Video Brand Guidelines</h2><h3 id="1-Keeps-your-videos-on-brand"><a href="#1-Keeps-your-videos-on-brand" class="headerlink" title="1. Keeps your videos on-brand"></a><strong>1. Keeps your videos on-brand</strong></h3><p>The most important reason for creating video brand guidelines is to keep all your videos feeling like they come from the same place. This way, no matter what type of video it is, viewers will always know it’s from your brand.</p>
<h3 id="2-Make-sure-everyone’s-on-the-same-page"><a href="#2-Make-sure-everyone’s-on-the-same-page" class="headerlink" title="2. Make sure everyone’s on the same page."></a><strong>2. Make sure everyone’s on the same page.</strong></h3><p>With so many people involved in the production of a single video, it can be hard to keep everyone on the same page. By having guidelines in place, you can make sure that everyone knows exactly what your brand’s video style is, and how to stay true to it.</p>
<h3 id="3-Saves-time-and-money"><a href="#3-Saves-time-and-money" class="headerlink" title="3. Saves time and money."></a><strong>3.

<h2 id="Strong-Pillars-of-Video-Brand-Guidelines"><a href="#Strong-Pillars-of-Video-Brand-Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="Strong Pillars of Video Brand Guidelines"></a>Strong Pillars of Video Brand Guidelines</h2><p>There are three strong pillars that make up a set of video brand guidelines: aesthetic (how it looks), technical (how it’s made), and messaging (what it says).</p>
<h3 id="AESTHETIC"><a href="#AESTHETIC" class="headerlink" title="AESTHETIC"></a><strong>AESTHETIC</strong></h3><p>The Aesthetic Pillar is all about how your videos look, from the overall style to the specific details like color schemes and fonts. This is usually determined by your company’s branding guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="TECHNICAL"><a href="#TECHNICAL" class="headerlink" title="TECHNICAL"></a><strong>TECHNICAL</strong></h3><p>The Technical Pillar covers the more practical elements of your video, such as file formats and resolution. This ensures that your videos are compatible with all kinds of devices and platforms.</p>
<h3 id="MESSAGING"><a href="#MESSAGING" class="headerlink" title="MESSAGING"></a><strong>MESSAGING</strong></h3><p>The Messaging Pillar deals with the actual content of your video, such as the script and narration. This is where you decide what message you want to communicate, and how you’re going to do it.</p>
<p>When writing your video brand standards, it’s important to keep all three pillars in mind. Each one plays a vital role in the overall impact of your video, so they should all be given equal attention.</p>
<h2 id="Different-Elements-of-Video-Brand"><a href="#Different-Elements-of-Video-Brand" class="headerlink" title="Different Elements of Video Brand"></a>Different Elements of Video Brand</h2><p>There are several elements that make up a video that reflecting your brand. These include:</p>
<h3 id="Logo"><a href="#Logo" class="headerlink" title="Logo"></a><strong>Logo</strong></h3><p>When and how should your logo be used? Should it appear at the beginning, end or throughout the video? These are just a few examples of what you might want to include in your guidelines. The important thing is to be as clear and concise as possible so that there’s no confusion about what does and doesn’t represent your brand.</p>
<p>Apple, for example, is a fantastic brand that uses its logo in video advertising. It may always be observed at the end of every video.</p>

<h3 id="Typography-choices"><a href="#Typography-choices" class="headerlink" title="Typography choices"></a><strong>Typography choices</strong></h3><p>Typography is a key element of branding. It’s more than just picking the right typeface, though that’s important, too. Typography includes the font, size and style of your title, body copy and web copy, as well as how it’s used in your logo and all other graphics.</p>

<h3 id="Imagery"><a href="#Imagery" class="headerlink" title="Imagery"></a><strong>Imagery</strong></h3><p>If you want to use images or photos in your videos, what style should they be? And are there any specific colours that need to be used?</p>

<h3 id="Voice"><a href="#Voice" class="headerlink" title="Voice"></a><strong>Voice</strong></h3><p>The way you speak to your customers is referred to as brand voice. Your brand’s communication style is what determines your brand voice. Your target audience will hear your brand voice, which can be informal or formal depending on the situation and needs of the client. It may have any tone as long as it feels genuine to your company’s principles and personality—</p>
<p>In terms of brand voice consistency, Apple conveys confidence, quality, and closeness. In terms of distinguishing oneself from the competition, Apple has always been the company to look up to. Many people feel welcomed and overindulged by having their own gadgets.</p>
<h3 id="Graphics"><a href="#Graphics" class="headerlink" title="Graphics"></a><strong>Graphics</strong></h3><p>If you want to use animation in your videos, you must first select a design that best represents your business. Is it going to be more cartoonish or more corporate?</p>
<p>It’s also crucial to provide rules for the use of certain visual components. If you want to include the speaker’s name and job title in the lower thirds, for example, you must state how that should appear.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="Transitions"><a href="#Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Transitions"></a><strong>Transitions</strong></h3><p>Transitions between shots may boost brand recognition.

<h3 id="Music-and-Sounds"><a href="#Music-and-Sounds" class="headerlink" title="Music and Sounds"></a><strong>Music and Sounds</strong></h3><p>Music can play a significant role in how your video is received. It should be used to create the right atmosphere and reinforce the tone of voice. Your brand guidelines should include examples of the types of music that would and wouldn’t be appropriate, as well as any sound effects that could be used.</p>

<h3 id="Format"><a href="#Format" class="headerlink" title="Format"></a><strong>Format</strong></h3><p>This section should detail what type of videos you want to produce.

<p>Your video brand guidelines should also consider where your videos will be shot. If you have a preferred location or style of location, such as an office or warehouse, make sure that is included.</p>
<p>Lighting is another important aspect of shooting style and can really affect the look and feel of a video. Consider what sort of lighting would work best with your brand - natural light, bright light, low light etc. - and include details in your guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="Tagline"><a href="#Tagline" class="headerlink" title="Tagline"></a><strong>Tagline</strong></h3><p>A tagline is a short phrase or sentence that identifies your brand. It’s often used in conjunction with a logo and other branding elements to create an overall marketing message</p>
<p>Nike recognized the need to appeal to a much wider audience, and transform their brand into more than simply fitness apparel. As a result of this, “Just Do It.” was created. The slogan is easy to understand and conveys the idea effectively. More significantly, it applies to everyone, not just world-class athletes</p>
<h2 id="How-to-create-Video-Brand-Guidelines"><a href="#How-to-create-Video-Brand-Guidelines" class="headerlink" title="How to create Video Brand Guidelines?"></a>How to create Video Brand Guidelines?</h2><p>Now that we’ve gone over why you need video brand guidelines, let’s take a look at how you can create them.</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-your-brand-voice"><a href="#1-Define-your-brand-voice" class="headerlink" title="1. Define your brand voice"></a><strong>1. Define your brand voice</strong></h3><p>This is perhaps the most important step in creating your guidelines, as it will determine the tone and style of all your future videos. To do this, you need to think about what makes your brand unique, and how you want it to be perceived by others. Once you have a good understanding of your brand voice, you can start to put together the rest of your guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="2-Choose-a-video-style"><a href="#2-Choose-a-video-style" class="headerlink" title="2. Choose a video style"></a><strong>2. Choose a video style</strong></h3><p>Depending on the kind of videos you want to make, you’ll need to choose an appropriate style. This could be anything from animation to live action, so it’s important to pick something that will work well with your brand voice.</p>
<h3 id="3-Decide-on-a-look-and-feel"><a href="#3-Decide-on-a-look-and-feel" class="headerlink" title="3. Decide on a look and feel"></a><strong>3. Decide on a look and feel</strong></h3><p>Just like with your choice of style, the look and feel of your videos should be in line with your brand identity. This means taking into account things like colour palette, typography and overall aesthetic.</p>
<h3 id="4-Write-a-script"><a href="#4-Write-a-script" class="headerlink" title="4. Write a script"></a><strong>4. Write a script</strong></h3><p>Once you have all the above elements in place, you can start to write a script for your video. This will act as a blueprint for the rest of the production process, so it’s important to get it right. When writing your script, be sure to keep your brand voice in mind, and make sure that the finished product stays true to your guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="5-Find-the-right-talent"><a href="#5-Find-the-right-talent" class="headerlink" title="5. Find the right talent"></a><strong>5. Find the right talent</strong></h3><p>To bring your script to life, you’ll need to find the right talent. This means finding voiceover artists, actors or presenters who fit with your brand identity and can help to sell your message.</p>
<h3 id="6-Record-and-edit-your-video"><a href="#6-Record-and-edit-your-video" class="headerlink" title="6. Record and edit your video"></a><strong>6. Record and edit your video</strong></h3><p>With all the pieces in place, you’re finally ready to record and edit your video. During this process, it’s important to stick to your guidelines, so that the finished product is on-brand and consistent with your other content.</p>
<h3 id="7-Publish-and-promote-your-video"><a href="#7-Publish-and-promote-your-video" class="headerlink" title="7. Publish and promote your video"></a><strong>7. Publish and promote your video</strong></h3><p>Once your video is complete, it’s time to hit publish and start promoting it to your audience. Remember to use all the channels at your disposal, from social media to email marketing, to make sure that as many people as possible see your brand-new video.</p>
<h2 id="Brand-Guidelines-Consistency"><a href="#Brand-Guidelines-Consistency" class="headerlink" title="Brand Guidelines Consistency"></a>Brand Guidelines Consistency</h2><p>It’s important to be consistent with your brand. One of the biggest mistakes a company can make is trying to brand itself as something it isn’t. If you’re perceived as one thing and then suddenly change, it may do more harm than good for your business or organization.</p>
<p>The most well-known example of a company with a consistent brand is Coca Cola. It is one of the company brands with consistent brand image and a very strong reputation. This can be attributed to the company’s efforts in marketing and advertising to create a distinct brand image. The Coca Cola Company has spent millions of dollars on advertising campaigns that focus on creating a positive image for the product and reinforcing its original taste.</p>
<p>You need to have consistency in all aspects of your brand: logo, voice and tone (including social media), visuals (such as color scheme), and more. Your audience will immediately identify any inconsistencies between these elements - so make sure they match up well!</p>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming"><a href="#Trimming" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting"><a href="#Cutting" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming-3"><a href="#Trimming-3" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting-3"><a href="#Cutting-3" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

It’s the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.</p>
<p>Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don’t alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.</p>

<ol>
<li>Double click on the video file you want to trim in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Adjust the timings of your edits. Drag the ends of your video clip as if you are resizing a window to shorten or extend by trimming. As your cursor gets closer at the edge of the video clip, you’ll see a red arrow.</li>

The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1"><a href="#Example-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #1"></a>Example #1</h3><p>Let’s say you have a video of someone walking through the woods.

<h3 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" class="headerlink" title="Example #2"></a>Example #2</h3><p>For a better understanding, let’s look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let’s see how to choose the best music audio for your video.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-1-Identify-the-mood"><a href="#Tip-1-Identify-the-mood" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Identify the mood"></a>Tip #1: Identify the mood</h2><p>As we’ve demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="identifying the mood of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you’ve figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-2-Video-and-music-style"><a href="#Tip-2-Video-and-music-style" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Video and music style"></a>Tip #2: Video and music style</h2><p>We’ve already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="matching the video and audio styles"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="identifying the audio wave"
                ></p>
<p>For example, if you’re using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-3-Don’t-force-the-music"><a href="#Tip-3-Don’t-force-the-music" class="headerlink" title="Tip #3: Don’t force the music"></a>Tip #3: Don’t force the music</h2><p>As emphasized before, your music should match your video. We all have a favorite music genre, but sometimes that may not go well with our visuals. For example, you love country music but have a video about the nightlife in the city. Using country music in a video about the town does not match well and will confuse your audience.</p>

<p>To get music that best suits our video, we must be open and explore all music genres. You’ll see how easy it is to scout a song that fits perfectly with your visuals. The easiest way is to choose a song that gives out the same emotions as intended by the visuals.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Now, you clearly understand the importance of music in videos. The right music can uplift your video into a viral sensation, while the wrong music track will turn your video into a catastrophe. Remember to review the legalities of copyright and infringement before using any music in your videos to avoid legal issues. Make sure you have permission to use the music or use royalty-free music.</p>

<p>The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we’ll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos-1"><a href="#How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How different types of music affect your videos"></a>How different types of music affect your videos</h2><p>You can easily change the viewer’s perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1-1"><a href="#Example-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #1"></a>Example #1</h3><p>Let’s say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.</p>

                      alt="adding an uplifting beat to your video"
                ></p>
<p>Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from “inspiring” to “sinister.” It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.</p>

<p>Text to Speech (TTS) is a technology that basically converts digital text into artificial audio. In this article, we’ll be sharing with you the 10 best Spanish text-to-speech converter websites that you can use for free. But before actually moving to the list, here is a little information on this topic.</p>

<p>As we all know, free stuff always comes with limitations (in most cases). However, we have tried our very best to provide you with a list of the best TTS converter websites that offer the highest benefits with the lowest limitations for free. Therefore, some websites in this list might be completely free while some might have a free plan to use but whatever they might be, know that they offer the best for something that’s free and includes support for Spanish.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?"></a>Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?</h2><p>Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.</p>
<p>Using a transparent background as a brand promotion tool helps to project forward the major highlights of your product with a supportive background image, like the brand logo. This helps the audience to have a general idea of your brand. Apart from this, you can also assure the authenticity and quality of your brand by using a watermark in the background image.</p>
<p>Images with transparent backgrounds are the current promotion trends, owing to their convenient compatibility with any web design and the flexibility to mix with the most diverse color palettes and different elements on the product webpage. These can further be easily rendered in 3D to present realistic product images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression"><a href="#01Compression" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency"><a href="#02Transparency" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color"><a href="#03Color" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation"><a href="#04Animation" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time.

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Adobe’s official website and download the Photoshop application in your device. Install and launch the same to reach the app’s welcome interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Inage Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Layering Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In this panel, double tap the ‘Background‘layer. This causes the ‘Rename Layer’ dialog box to appear. You can either enter a suitable name or continue with the default ‘Layer 0’ name. When you are done, click on ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Layer Rename Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-12.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?"></a>Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?</h2><p>Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.</p>
<p>Using a transparent background as a brand promotion tool helps to project forward the major highlights of your product with a supportive background image, like the brand logo. This helps the audience to have a general idea of your brand. Apart from this, you can also assure the authenticity and quality of your brand by using a watermark in the background image.</p>
<p>Images with transparent backgrounds are the current promotion trends, owing to their convenient compatibility with any web design and the flexibility to mix with the most diverse color palettes and different elements on the product webpage. These can further be easily rendered in 3D to present realistic product images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-1"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-1"><a href="#01Compression-1" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-1"><a href="#02Transparency-1" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-1"><a href="#03Color-1" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-1"><a href="#04Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-an-Image-Background-Transparent-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-an-Image-Background-Transparent-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Make an Image Background Transparent"></a>Part 3 How to Make an Image Background Transparent</h2><p>Having known enough about the credibility of transparent background images, it sounds quite interesting to try your hands at creating these of your own.

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Adobe’s official website and download the Photoshop application in your device. Install and launch the same to reach the app’s welcome interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Inage Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Layering Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In this panel, double tap the ‘Background‘layer. This causes the ‘Rename Layer’ dialog box to appear. You can either enter a suitable name or continue with the default ‘Layer 0’ name. When you are done, click on ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Layer Rename Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-12.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility.

<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-2"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-2"><a href="#01Compression-2" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-2"><a href="#02Transparency-2" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-2"><a href="#03Color-2" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-2"><a href="#04Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility.

<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-3"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-3"><a href="#01Compression-3" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-3"><a href="#02Transparency-3" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-3"><a href="#03Color-3" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-3"><a href="#04Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Adobe’s official website and download the Photoshop application in your device. Install and launch the same to reach the app’s welcome interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-9.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Inage Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-10.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Layering Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In this panel, double tap the ‘Background‘layer. This causes the ‘Rename Layer’ dialog box to appear. You can either enter a suitable name or continue with the default ‘Layer 0’ name. When you are done, click on ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-11.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Layer Rename Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-12.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-13.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

<p>Now, you can narrate your story with incredible text and title templates in this full-featured video editor. It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.</p>
<p>You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="print module"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>

                      alt="template browser"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Insert Photos</strong></p>
<p>After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.</p>

Instagram is far ahead of the competition in this regard. It has played a crucial role in establishing the photo collage as a normal trend.</p>
<p><strong>For the photographer</strong></p>
<p>With a photo collage, a photographer can best showcase his talent. It shows that you can do a lot more than your capabilities, like representing stories by blending colors and elements perfectly. This will help you attract your prospects and convert them into your paying customers.</p>
<p><strong>How do photo collages provide value to the clients?</strong></p>
<p>A photo collage provides visual value to the clients by enhancing the creative process. It can have a profound effect on the way they perceive your art of photography. In fact, your clients will love to see all their memories collected in an attractive photo collage. There are a lot of people that even love to present collages to their loved ones.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-1"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

If you want to create a <strong>lightroom collage</strong> of pictures, follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a New Template</strong></p>
<p>For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it’s worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs</strong></p>
<p>Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Establishing the Workspace</strong></p>
<p>After importing and editing the photos, it’s time to create a workspace. Go to the “Print” panel and then to the “Print Job” menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create a Photo Layout</strong></p>
<p>As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the “Add to Package” section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It’s pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn’t seem pleasing to your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template</strong></p>
<p>Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? <strong>Make a collage in Lightroom</strong> using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won’t get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import the photos into the program</strong></p>
<p>Here also, you can’t create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on “File” &gt; “Add Photos” and choose the file location.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Download the collage layout</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a <strong>photo collage in Lightroom.</strong> You are free to download any one that appeals to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Bring in the Template</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Print” module &gt; “Template Browser” &gt; “Lightroom Templates” menu. Now, import the extracted <strong>Lightroom collage template</strong> using the “Import” button.</p>

                ></p>

<p>With a photo collage, a photographer can best showcase his talent. It shows that you can do a lot more than your capabilities, like representing stories by blending colors and elements perfectly. This will help you attract your prospects and convert them into your paying customers.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-3"><a href="#Part-3-Core-Considerations-for-a-Lightroom-Collage-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage"></a>Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage</h2><p>The secret to designing an eye-catching <strong>lightroom collage</strong> is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.</p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<p>Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Don’t underestimate the importance of alignment in <strong>Lightroom collage</strong>. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.</p>
<p>In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.</p>
<p><strong>Proximity</strong></p>
<p>Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Realistic pictures should be put together.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Unrelatable images should be separated.</p>
<p>Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong></p>
<p>The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it’s not as measurable as others.</p>

It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Ways-to-Use-Freeze-Frame-in-Video-editing"><a href="#Part-2-Ways-to-Use-Freeze-Frame-in-Video-editing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing"></a>Part 2 <strong>Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing</strong></h2><p>Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the beginning of a movie&#x2F;video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience’s interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This <strong>freeze-frame</strong> technique was used in the film ‘Good Fellas’ to pique the audience’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The ‘breakfast club’ filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie ‘The Departed.’</p>

<p>Here is a list of the best <strong>freeze frame examples</strong> you would love;</p>
<h3 id="01The-Departed"><a href="#01The-Departed" class="headerlink" title="01The Departed"></a>01<strong>The Departed</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The Departed"
                ></p>
<p>In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.</p>
<p>He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.</p>
<h3 id="02Rocky-III"><a href="#02Rocky-III" class="headerlink" title="02Rocky III"></a>02<strong>Rocky III</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-2.jpg"
                      alt="Rocky III"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.</p>
<p>During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.</p>
<p>The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, “Ding Dong.”</p>
<p>The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.</p>
<h3 id="03400-Blows"><a href="#03400-Blows" class="headerlink" title="03400 Blows"></a>03<strong>400 Blows</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="400 blows"
                ></p>
<p>In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.</p>
<p>In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.</p>
<p>He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="04Thelma-and-Louise"><a href="#04Thelma-and-Louise" class="headerlink" title="04Thelma and Louise"></a>04<strong>Thelma and Louise</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Thelma and Louise"
                ></p>
<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>
<p>Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.</p>

It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> At the beginning of a movie&#x2F;video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience’s interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This <strong>freeze-frame</strong> technique was used in the film ‘Good Fellas’ to pique the audience’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The ‘breakfast club’ filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie ‘The Departed.’</p>

It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.</p>
<p>But several movie directors have effectively used the <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing technique that wowed the audience.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the best <strong>freeze frame examples</strong> you would love;</p>
<h3 id="01The-Departed-1"><a href="#01The-Departed-1" class="headerlink" title="01The Departed"></a>01<strong>The Departed</strong></h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.</p>
<p>He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.</p>
<h3 id="02Rocky-III-1"><a href="#02Rocky-III-1" class="headerlink" title="02Rocky III"></a>02<strong>Rocky III</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Rocky III"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.</p>
<p>During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.</p>
<p>The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, “Ding Dong.”</p>
<p>The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.</p>

<p>In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.</p>
<p>In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.</p>
<p>He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.</p>

                      alt="Thelma and Louise"
                ></p>
<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>
<p>Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.</p>

<p>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are shown at the movie’s beginning, sitting together in a diner. They argue whether it will be safer to rub a bank or a restaurant. In the end, they settle for a diner — the same one they are sitting in.</p>

<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> gives us a sneak peek of the violence to experience in the movie, and indeed, we were not disappointed.</p>

It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.</p>
<p>But several movie directors have effectively used the <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing technique that wowed the audience.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the best <strong>freeze frame examples</strong> you would love;</p>
<h3 id="01The-Departed-2"><a href="#01The-Departed-2" class="headerlink" title="01The Departed"></a>01<strong>The Departed</strong></h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.</p>
<p>He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.</p>
<h3 id="02Rocky-III-2"><a href="#02Rocky-III-2" class="headerlink" title="02Rocky III"></a>02<strong>Rocky III</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Rocky III"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.</p>
<p>During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.</p>
<p>The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, “Ding Dong.”</p>
<p>The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.</p>
<h3 id="03400-Blows-2"><a href="#03400-Blows-2" class="headerlink" title="03400 Blows"></a>03<strong>400 Blows</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="400 blows"
                ></p>
<p>In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.</p>
<p>In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.</p>
<p>He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="04Thelma-and-Louise-2"><a href="#04Thelma-and-Louise-2" class="headerlink" title="04Thelma and Louise"></a>04<strong>Thelma and Louise</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Thelma and Louise"
                ></p>
<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>
<p>Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.</p>
<h3 id="05The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street-2"><a href="#05The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street-2" class="headerlink" title="05The Wolf of Wall Street"></a>05<strong>The Wolf of Wall Street</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The wolf of wall street"
                ></p>
<p>Scorsese uses freeze-frame at the beginning of this movie, just as he did in Good Fellas. The freeze-frame effect here helps introduce the character and shows us the plot of the movie hence piquing the audience’s interests immediately.</p>
<h3 id="06Out-of-Sight-2"><a href="#06Out-of-Sight-2" class="headerlink" title="06Out of Sight"></a>06<strong>Out of Sight</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Out of Sight"
                ></p>
<p>This movie is another excellent example of <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing. What other way to pique the audience’s interest significantly and emphasize them than capture them in a freeze-frame.</p>
<h3 id="07Death-Proof-2"><a href="#07Death-Proof-2" class="headerlink" title="07Death Proof"></a>07<strong>Death Proof</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Death Proof"
                ></p>
<p>In this movie, the freeze-frame stays till the very end. It captures three women as they raise their hands-on celebration after successfully beating to death a psychopath who has been killing young women.</p>
<h3 id="08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-2"><a href="#08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-2" class="headerlink" title="08Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"></a>08<strong>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid"
                ></p>
<p>This movie follows two train robbers, Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, known as the ‘Sundance Kid.’ After conducting several robberies, they go on the run as the authorities pursue them. After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.</p>
<p>Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.</p>
<h3 id="09Good-Fellas-2"><a href="#09Good-Fellas-2" class="headerlink" title="09Good Fellas"></a>09<strong>Good Fellas</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Good fellas"
                ></p>
<p>Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in ‘Good Fellas’ to emphasize the movie plot.</p>
<p>In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> before uttering the lines, “As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster.”</p>
<p>This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.</p>
<h3 id="10Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban-2"><a href="#10Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban-2" class="headerlink" title="10Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"></a>10<strong>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Hardy Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban"
                ></p>
<p>During a bad and weird year at Hogwarts, Harry potter experiences an extremely joyous moment when he goes anti-gravity on his new Firebolt broom.</p>
<p>He becomes overjoyed and his expression gets captured in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="11The-Breakfast-Club-2"><a href="#11The-Breakfast-Club-2" class="headerlink" title="11The Breakfast Club"></a>11<strong>The Breakfast Club</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The Breakfast Club"
                ></p>
<p>The Breakfast Club is an 80s movie showing teenagers trying to find their identity in life and overcoming the challenges of these years.</p>
<p>This is another <strong>freeze frame example</strong> where the filmmakers showed great expertise. The character John Bender is caught in a <strong>freeze-frame,</strong> punching the air to celebrate his victory.</p>
<p>He has just shared a kiss with the class sweetheart Claire. He and his classmates have also just won over the authoritative principal, Mr. Vernon.</p>

<p>Pulp Fiction is another movie such as ‘Good Fellas’ with its freeze-frame edition done at the movie’s beginning.</p>
<p>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are shown at the movie’s beginning, sitting together in a diner. They argue whether it will be safer to rub a bank or a restaurant. In the end, they settle for a diner — the same one they are sitting in.</p>

<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world.

Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>

After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.</p>
<p>Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in ‘Good Fellas’ to emphasize the movie plot.</p>
<p>In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> before uttering the lines, “As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster.”</p>
<p>This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.</p>

<p>Pulp Fiction is another movie such as ‘Good Fellas’ with its freeze-frame edition done at the movie’s beginning.</p>
<p>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are shown at the movie’s beginning, sitting together in a diner. They argue whether it will be safer to rub a bank or a restaurant. In the end, they settle for a diner — the same one they are sitting in.</p>
<p>They kiss and pull out their guns, and the images freeze before the credits roll out.</p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> gives us a sneak peek of the violence to experience in the movie, and indeed, we were not disappointed.</p>

Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography</h3><p>Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).</p>
<p>Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.</p>
<p>The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 &#x3D; RT</p>

After importing the video clip to the timeline, right-click it and choose Speed and Duration to open the custom speed pop-up. Go to the Duration section and you will see the original duration of the video. Adjusting the duration of the video longer will add a slow-motion effect to the video. Changing the duration of the video to a shorter time will speed up the playback speed of the video. Just directly input the number in the field to speed up&#x2F;slow down the video.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add Audio</li>

<h2 id="Best-Audio-Plug-Ins-For-Video-Editors"><a href="#Best-Audio-Plug-Ins-For-Video-Editors" class="headerlink" title="Best Audio Plug-Ins For Video Editors"></a>Best Audio Plug-Ins For Video Editors</h2><p>When it comes to improving the sound of the audio in your video editing projects, you have a variety of options to choose from when approaching the editing. Most plugins that we will cover today will be helpful for many different effects instead of only one particular one.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="1-Synchro-Arts-Revoice-Pro"><a href="#1-Synchro-Arts-Revoice-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Synchro Arts Revoice Pro"></a>1. Synchro Arts Revoice Pro</h2><p>Let’s talk about Revoice Pro 4. This is an awesome plugin for when you are finishing complex editing projects when you work with dialogues and need to synchronize other lines to fit the shot. Revoice Pro 4 combines timing and pitch alignment technology, together with as a pair of cutting-edge tuning tools and a natural-sounding vocal doubler for people working on the narrator voice.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/synchro-arts-revoice-pro.jpg"
                      alt="synchro arts revoice pro"
                ></p>
<p>For the video editors working in audio post-production, the stand out new feature added to Revoice Pro is Smart Align combined with a fast workflow, meaning that you don’t need to leave Pro Tools to synchronize ADR to the location audio. Although Version 4.3 presented an ARA version of the Revoice Pro link plug-in for Logic Pro users, so providing immediate transfers back and forth between Logic Pro or higher Synchro Arts haven’t counted out Pro Tools users by preparing a new set of AudioSuite plugins.</p>
<p>The APT procedures, used to align the pitch and timing of multiple vocal tracks, now includes SmartAlign. When this is turned on, it can align audio with significant gaps in the guide or even dub the audio. This feature enables you to align much longer performances, which in the past had to be divided into smaller sections.</p>
<p> As Revoice Pro has improved over the years, the latest version is giving you the ultimate workflow it should always have had in the past. Synchro Arts have been able to create the perfect workflow with an AudioSuite plugin, that runs Revoice Pro in the background without having to have to switch back between Revoice Pro and Pro Tools. Select your audio and the desiredRevoice Pro preset, process the audio in Revoice Pro and place it directly into the timeline without having to leave Pro Tools.</p>
<p>Smart Align and the Quick APT AudioSuite plugin made this fairly easy, yet powerful, workflow. Synchro Arts has also been able to fix the tasks of how to handle gaps. Before V4.3, you had to make sure there weren’t any unexpected empty spots, or it was not able to work out what to do. Using Smart Align, it handles the gaps without any problems.</p>
<p>Whether you need to tighten any kind of pitch or timings on a vocal recording, Revoice Pro is the one for you. Revoice Pro is great for working with vocal recordings, but it’s perfectly suitable for instruments like guitars and strings too.</p>
<p>Synchro Arts Revoice Pro is available for $599.</p>
<h2 id="2-Red-Giant-Magic-Bullet-Colorista"><a href="#2-Red-Giant-Magic-Bullet-Colorista" class="headerlink" title="2. Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista"></a>2. Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista</h2><p>This is a very interesting plugin. Colorista tries to cancel out the need for a separate color-specific program by increasing more color correction options. This plugin allows you to have more color control with tools for tints, temperatures, vignetting, RGB curving, and so forth. Colorista contains a three-way color function and support for LOG clips and LUT filters. Colorista is not a stand-alone program. It’s designed to integrate into existing software and offer better functionality. Plugins let you design something that wasn’t there originally. You don’t have to load a certain project to activate them.</p>

                      alt="red giant magic bullet colorista"
                ></p>
<p>For years, Red Giant has been one of the biggest developers of plugins designed for video editing software. Among the other ones is the Magic bullet suite, which contains quite some plugins to solve video noise problems and do some color grading. We believe the versatility of Red Giant allow content creators and movie producers to let their ideas come to life, create dynamic art and create better content overall.</p>
<p>Even though Red Giant’s Magic Bullet Suite is a plugin suite created for Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, it also works with other video editing software such as VEGAS Pro. The suite focuses on color correction and color grading improvements. VEGAS Pro is my software of choice, but one aspect of Premiere that I’ve always thought inadequate were the color correction tools. Looks is completely customizable, and a “preset” can be built up from zero. The Colorista suite comes with a lot of other plugins that have crucial roles in the color grading aspect of video editing. Denoiser II is ideal for clearing up scratchy footage.</p>

<h2 id="Best-Animated-Video-Makers"><a href="#Best-Animated-Video-Makers" class="headerlink" title="Best Animated Video Makers"></a>Best Animated Video Makers</h2><p>Animations can be a great way to get your work to stand out and the best animated video maker can help you get this effect very easily. Here, we will be helping you find the best way to create animated videos for your particular project.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.</p>
<p>Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="When-to-Use-an-Animated-Video-Maker"><a href="#When-to-Use-an-Animated-Video-Maker" class="headerlink" title="When to Use an Animated Video Maker"></a>When to Use an Animated Video Maker</h2><p>There are several reasons why you would want to create an animated video, rather than use traditional video solutions. The following are the most important from a digital marketing standpoint;</p>
<p><strong>Improve Conversion and Sales</strong></p>
<p>Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Brand Awareness</strong></p>
<p>Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.</p>
<p><strong>Generate Online Leads</strong></p>
<p>Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Explain Complex Processes</strong></p>
<p>It can be very difficult to try to explain very complex ideas such as the mechanical aspect of a certain tool using words. But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.</p>

Back Up Your Files</h2><p>Backing up your files gives you peace of mind. If one file is lost, the whole project becomes vulnerable to failure. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure the protection of files. The best way to protect the files from any misfortune is to back them up.</p>
<p>Remember, there is no specific way to back up your files. Depending on the project’s requirements, you can do that differently. The following steps will light up how you can back up your files.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Check and Save</strong></p>

                      alt="launch vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Run VLC Media Player and then click on “Media” &gt; “Open File” to upload the AVI file from your PC or Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the Video Frame</strong></p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-converting-avi-to-gif-5.jpg"
                      alt="select video frame vlc"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, the video will start running on your VLC media player screen. Now, select the video frame for getting the desired animation. Next, go to the “Video” menu and choose “Take Snapshop”. This step will save the video frame in the PNG format to the My Pictures folder.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Open MSPaint</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open ms paint"
                ></p>
<p>You will have to open MSPaint on your PC. When it opens, click on the “File” menu and then open the snapshot that you had taken in the previous step. Again, click on “File” &gt; “Save As” &gt; “GIF” to download your GIF.</p>
<h3 id="03Convert-AVI-to-GIF-Using-Photoshop-3"><a href="#03Convert-AVI-to-GIF-Using-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="03Convert AVI to GIF Using Photoshop"></a>03Convert AVI to GIF Using Photoshop</h3><p>Converting <strong>AVI to GIF</strong> with photoshop can be a bit complex but you will get the highest quality GIFs in a short time. Read the steps here to start converting your AVI file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Import</strong></p>
<p>Run Adobe Photoshop on your PC or Mac. As the home interface will open, click on “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video Frames to Layers”. Now, import your AVI video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Cut the Part</strong></p>
<p>Separate that part of the video for which you want to create a GIF. From the “Range to Import option, select the default “Beginning to End” or “Selected Range”. You also have to check the box in the “Make Frame Animation” option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Check and Save</strong></p>
<p>Come back to the window and check the animation. Trim or add frames if it seems necessary or else simply go to the left side of the animation and click on check forever.</p>
<p>At last, open “File” &gt; “Save for Web”. Now from the “Preset” menu, choose from the GIF option or select from the drop-down list manually. Finish by clicking on “Save”.</p>

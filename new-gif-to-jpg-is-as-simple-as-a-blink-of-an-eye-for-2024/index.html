Undoubtedly, this conversion is easy but only when you are aware of the right steps. Until and unless you have no clue about the steps, the <strong>JPG to GIF</strong> conversion seems to be impossible. Let’s have a look at the steps you need to follow for it:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Firstly, “choose the photos”. Until and unless you do not have the selected photos, you cannot initiate the conversion process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the right tool. A tool is important to choose because, without it, you cannot be a part of the process. In this case, we are discussing ADOBE Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Upload all the photos that you have selected and move them to the timeline panel by clicking on the Windows option. Here you need to select “Create Video Timeline.”</p>

Undoubtedly, this conversion is easy but only when you are aware of the right steps. Until and unless you have no clue about the steps, the <strong>JPG to GIF</strong> conversion seems to be impossible. Let’s have a look at the steps you need to follow for it:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Firstly, “choose the photos”. Until and unless you do not have the selected photos, you cannot initiate the conversion process.</p>

Undoubtedly, this conversion is easy but only when you are aware of the right steps. Until and unless you have no clue about the steps, the <strong>JPG to GIF</strong> conversion seems to be impossible. Let’s have a look at the steps you need to follow for it:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Firstly, “choose the photos”. Until and unless you do not have the selected photos, you cannot initiate the conversion process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the right tool. A tool is important to choose because, without it, you cannot be a part of the process. In this case, we are discussing ADOBE Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Upload all the photos that you have selected and move them to the timeline panel by clicking on the Windows option. Here you need to select “Create Video Timeline.”</p>

Undoubtedly, this conversion is easy but only when you are aware of the right steps. Until and unless you have no clue about the steps, the <strong>JPG to GIF</strong> conversion seems to be impossible. Let’s have a look at the steps you need to follow for it:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Firstly, “choose the photos”. Until and unless you do not have the selected photos, you cannot initiate the conversion process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the right tool. A tool is important to choose because, without it, you cannot be a part of the process. In this case, we are discussing ADOBE Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Upload all the photos that you have selected and move them to the timeline panel by clicking on the Windows option. Here you need to select “Create Video Timeline.”</p>

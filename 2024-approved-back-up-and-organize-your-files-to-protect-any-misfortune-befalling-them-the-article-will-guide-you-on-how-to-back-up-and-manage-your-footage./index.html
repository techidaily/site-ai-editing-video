The Article Will Guide You on How to Back up and Manage Your Footage</h2><p>Backing up your data is deemed significantly necessary among video editing communities. Files get corrupted easily. Having a backup drive can save your day and countless hours. You can back up your data any way you deem fit. However, it will do you right if you follow the advice of professionals.</p>
<p>The article is written explicitly after due consideration and suggestions from the professional video editor. You can follow the steps in it to make backup files. Let us start with very straightforward steps to help you understand the professional way of backing up and organizing your footage.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Back-Up-Your-Files"><a href="#Part-1-Back-Up-Your-Files" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Back Up Your Files"></a>Part 1. Back Up Your Files</h2><p>Backing up your files gives you peace of mind. If one file is lost, the whole project becomes vulnerable to failure. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure the protection of files. The best way to protect the files from any misfortune is to back them up.</p>
<p>Remember, there is no specific way to back up your files. Depending on the project’s requirements, you can do that differently. The following steps will light up how you can back up your files.</p>
<h5 id="Step1Back-up-your-files-in-two-different-places"><a href="#Step1Back-up-your-files-in-two-different-places" class="headerlink" title="Step1Back up your files in two different places"></a>Step1Back up your files in two different places</h5><p>It is crucial to do that.

Make separate folders for the different formats you are importing in your drive. Always use the primary source to make a copy of your files.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to understand how to back up your files in two drives.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder in your drive.</li>
<li>Name it. You can name it according to the given format. The choice is yours.</li>

<ul>
<li>Your backup folder is created.</li>
<li>Make new folders based on the files that are imported into the file. We are making two folders for the project, 01 Footage, and 02 Audio.  <ul>
<li>01 Footage is for the original footage.  </li>
<li>02 Audio is for audio files provided by the music artist.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Most people make the mistake of making a backup drive and then using the same drive to make the second backup. The approach needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>We are done with backing up our files. It is time to organize the files in your drive.</p>

Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.</p>
<p>In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you’ll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video’s resolution, let’s look into what a video resolution is!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?</h2><p>A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of <strong>tiny pixels</strong> and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.</p>
<p>Video resolution is rendered in a <strong>vertical</strong> and <strong>horizontal</strong> orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., <strong>480p</strong>, <strong>720p</strong>, <strong>1080p,</strong> etc.</p>
<p>In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a <strong>720p</strong> video is <strong>1280 x 720,</strong> and a <strong>1080p</strong> video is a <strong>1920 x 1080</strong> resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.</p>

<h3 id="Decreasing-a-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Decreasing-a-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Decreasing a Video Resolution"></a>Decreasing a Video Resolution</h3><p>Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.</p>
<p>If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a <strong>4K</strong> resolution, and your phone is of <strong>1080p</strong> resolution. You might not be able to play it.</p>
<p>To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.</p>

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline"
                ></p>

<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Exporting a Video to a Specific Device</strong></p>
<p>Selecting a format for your video can help if you want to change the resolution. But in cases where you want to export a video to a particular mobile device. Such as an <strong>iPhone</strong> or an <strong>iPad</strong>, you can select the device export option.</p>
<p>In the device export option, you can select a custom device. Filmora allows you to choose from a wide variety of machines available when you choose a custom device; the resolution will be set to optimal for that particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Select a Folder to Export Your Video</strong></p>
<p>After you are done calibrating the resolution settings, you can move on to select the export location for your video. You can do so by the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the main Export window, navigate to the <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Folder</strong></li>
<li>It will direct you to your PC library.</li>
<li>Select the directory you want to export your video to.</li>

<p>Now that we have our clips imported, it is time to add them to the timeline below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>To add Video clips to the timeline, go through the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Right click to drag and select the <strong>video clips</strong> in the import window.</li>
<li>Release Right-click when in the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have added the video clips to the timeline. Instead, it has created a workplace to edit our videos.</p>
<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video-1"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora setting a custom resolution"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Exporting a Video to a Specific Device</strong></p>
<p>Selecting a format for your video can help if you want to change the resolution. But in cases where you want to export a video to a particular mobile device. Such as an <strong>iPhone</strong> or an <strong>iPad</strong>, you can select the device export option.</p>
<p>In the device export option, you can select a custom device. Filmora allows you to choose from a wide variety of machines available when you choose a custom device; the resolution will be set to optimal for that particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Select a Folder to Export Your Video</strong></p>
<p>After you are done calibrating the resolution settings, you can move on to select the export location for your video. You can do so by the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the main Export window, navigate to the <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Folder</strong></li>
<li>It will direct you to your PC library.</li>
<li>Select the directory you want to export your video to.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Select Folder</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora selects a custom folder for export"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Final Step</strong></p>
<p>The last step to export your video is clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> icon in the bottom right corner of the window. It opens up a <strong>render</strong> window. Wait for a few minutes until the video finishes exporting.</p>
<p>When the export is finished, a window will pop up as a reminder. You can also find the target folder by clicking on <strong>Find Target</strong>.</p>

Anyone can do it, but before you get started, we will share some do’s and don’ts to help you get the best results.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many ways to set up a green screen, but the most cost-efficient way is with a green screen fabric. If you are using a green fabric as a DIY green screen, make sure you steam or iron it out, whether taping it to a wall or hanging it off the rack. Keep in mind the green screen should not leave any wrinkles.</p>
<p>It is because wrinkles will make lighting the green screen a nightmare, and uneven lighting will leave you with shadows and disappointing results. It would help if you also pulled the green screen tight to get a seamless background. The better you do with the setup, the easier it will be the key it out later</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen"></a>Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how nice your green screen is. You won’t get good results if you don’t light it properly. When you light a green screen, be aware of these things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure there are at least six feet of space between you and your green screen; therefore, you’re not casting a shadow that cannot be keyed out later.</li>
<li>Remember, any shadow on the green screen is bad. The lighting on the screen should be flat, even, and one-dimensional meaning. Please don’t place the screen leaning at an angle since they’ll make it harder to light evenly.</li>
<li>Do light yourself and your background separately. It will ensure your subject wouldn’t bleed into the green, which will create a halo around them.</li>
<li>After you key out the green screen and lighting, your subjects should emulate the lighting from your final footage. For example, if you know sunlight is coming from the left light, your subject is from the left direction as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-4-Keying-out-your-green-screen"><a href="#Part-4-Keying-out-your-green-screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Keying out your green screen"></a>Part 4. Keying out your green screen</h2><p>Once your footage is good, go into <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and import it into your timeline, then double-click it to find the chroma key menu. However, don’t stop there. Clicking the chroma key button is not enough to guarantee perfectly keyed footage, so play around with the offset tolerance edge thickness and edge feather. Lastly, adjust it to make sure your edit looks as good as possible.</p>

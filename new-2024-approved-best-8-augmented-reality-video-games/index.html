When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, <strong>transparent GIFs</strong>.</p>
<p>Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a <strong>transparent GIF</strong> from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF</strong></p>
<p>Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.</p>
<p>In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Color Selection</strong></p>
<p>Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.</p>

This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.</p>
<p>This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!</p>

When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, <strong>transparent GIFs</strong>.</p>
<p>Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a <strong>transparent GIF</strong> from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF</strong></p>
<p>Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.</p>
<p>In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.</p>

                      alt="Original GIF with White Background"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Color Selection</strong></p>
<p>Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG"
                      alt="Background Options"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Processed GIF with Transparent Background"
                ></p>
<p>This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent-1"><a href="#Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?"></a>Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?</h2><p>No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.</p>
<p>This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!</p>

It’s simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let’s learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="Preparation"><a href="#Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h2><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn’t need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It’s even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent’s collection.</p>
<p>How to create a 1950s vintage film:</p>

<p>Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the <strong>Effect</strong> tab on the top menu bar and choose the <strong>Crop</strong> effect under the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.</p>

<p>Up to here, you’ll realize that your video doesn’t still look like a 1950s film per se.

<p>Please don’t stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the <strong>Overlay</strong> menu under the Effects tab, then click <strong>Old Film</strong>. After that, choose the <strong>Random Dust, Dirty Film,</strong> and <strong>Subtle Grain</strong> effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.</p>

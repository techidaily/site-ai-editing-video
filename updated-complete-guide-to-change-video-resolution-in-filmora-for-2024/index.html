Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.</p>
<p>In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you’ll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video’s resolution, let’s look into what a video resolution is!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?</h2><p>A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of <strong>tiny pixels</strong> and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.</p>
<p>Video resolution is rendered in a <strong>vertical</strong> and <strong>horizontal</strong> orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., <strong>480p</strong>, <strong>720p</strong>, <strong>1080p,</strong> etc.</p>
<p>In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a <strong>720p</strong> video is <strong>1280 x 720,</strong> and a <strong>1080p</strong> video is a <strong>1920 x 1080</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.</p>
<p>Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let’s look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-7-Different-Types-of-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-2-7-Different-Types-of-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution"></a>Part 2. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution</h2><p>It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!</p>
<h3 id="360p"><a href="#360p" class="headerlink" title="360p"></a>360p</h3><p>The full resolution is <strong>480 x 360</strong>. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, <strong>360p</strong> will look blurry. That is why a <strong>360p</strong> resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.</p>
<h3 id="480p"><a href="#480p" class="headerlink" title="480p"></a>480p</h3><p>The full resolution is <strong>853 x 480</strong>. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It’s mainly used in devices such as smaller <strong>TVs</strong>, <strong>laptops,</strong> and <strong>Desktop</strong> computers. It is also available for Burn-in <strong>DVDs</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="720p"><a href="#720p" class="headerlink" title="720p"></a>720p</h3><p>The full version of the resolution is <strong>1280 x 720</strong>. This resolution is called <strong>HD</strong>, short for High Definition. <strong>720p</strong> quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.</p>
<p>Most modern devices, such as <strong>Mobile phones</strong>, <strong>Touch Tablets</strong>, <strong>Laptops,</strong> and <strong>PCs,</strong> are calibrated in <strong>720p</strong> Resolution.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="1080p"><a href="#1080p" class="headerlink" title="1080p"></a>1080p</h3><p>The resolution in its complete form is <strong>1920 x 1080</strong>. This resolution is also known as <strong>FHD</strong>, short for <strong>Full High Definition. 1080p</strong> resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.</p>
<h3 id="1440p"><a href="#1440p" class="headerlink" title="1440p"></a>1440p</h3><p>This resolution is also called <strong>QHD (Quad HD</strong>). The length and width of this resolution are <strong>2560 x 1440</strong>. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard <strong>720p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p>The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in <strong>Gaming monitors</strong> and <strong>High-end smartphones</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="2160p"><a href="#2160p" class="headerlink" title="2160p"></a>2160p</h3><p>The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. <strong>2160p (3840 x 2160)</strong> is also known as <strong>UHD</strong>, which is short for <strong>Ultra High Definition</strong>. It is also known as <strong>4K</strong> because it offers four times the power of <strong>1080p</strong> or <strong>FHD</strong> (Full High Definition.)</p>
<p>These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen <strong>LCD</strong> and <strong>LED</strong> Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with <strong>4K</strong> resolution.</p>

<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In the main Export window, navigate to the <strong>Save</strong></li>

                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our clips imported, it is time to add them to the timeline below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>To add Video clips to the timeline, go through the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Right click to drag and select the <strong>video clips</strong> in the import window.</li>
<li>Release Right-click when in the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-10.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have added the video clips to the timeline. Instead, it has created a workplace to edit our videos.</p>
<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video-1"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

                      alt="click the lasso tool"
                ></p>
<p>Press the <strong>CMD&#x2F;Ctrl + C</strong> on your computer’s keyboard to copy the selection. Next, click the “<strong>Layer</strong>“ option in the top toolbar, select “<strong>New</strong>,” and click “<strong>Layer via Copy</strong>.”</p>

                      alt="click layer via copy"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Now, hide the background layer in the <strong>“Layers”</strong> panel on the right-hand side, and you will get your object without any BG. Click the <strong>“Image”</strong> option in the top toolbar and select <strong>“Adjustments.”</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>“Threshold…”</strong> from the drop-down menu, and set the <strong>“Threshold level.”</strong> Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Cmd&#x2F;ctrl+Shift+U”</strong> on the keyboard to desaturate the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click threshold"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Next, select the <strong>“Magic Eraser Tool”</strong> from the left-side menu and remove the white parts to smooth down the background. Afterward, choose the <strong>“Move Tool”</strong> from the menu and drag your object to a new layer.</p>
<p>To add the background image, click <strong>“File”</strong> and select <strong>“Open.”</strong> Next, select the file and again click <strong>“Open.”</strong></p>
<p>Step5 Select the object using the <strong>“Move Tool”</strong> and drag it to the background image layer. If the thing is too large and you want to resize it, select the object using the <strong>“CMD&#x2F;Ctrl”</strong> key and click <strong>“Edit”</strong> from the top toolbar. From the drop-down menu, choose <strong>“Transform”</strong> and click <strong>“Scale.”</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the object using the move tool"
                ></p>
<p>Next, drag the handles to adjust the size of the object on the Background image.</p>
<p>Step6 Click the <strong>“T”</strong> icon from the left-hand side menu and set the font style, color, and size. You can also click the <strong>“3D”</strong> option to convert your text to a three-dimensional form.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-text-to-the-canvas-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="click t icon"
                ></p>
<p>Try removing the left-out white patches on the object using the <strong>“Magic Eraser Tool”</strong> to give a polished look to the print screen effect. Once you are satisfied, click the <strong>“File”</strong> option from the top toolbar panel and select <strong>“Save As.”</strong></p>
<p>Type in the file name and select the file type from the drop-down menu next to <strong>“Save As Type.”</strong> Choose the storage location, click <strong>“Save”</strong> to export your final project, and you’re done!</p>

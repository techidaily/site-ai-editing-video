<p>Another way of making an impressive use of emojis in your promotional media posts is creating engaging feature lists of your brand, or adding the same to the product headlines, while giving them an extra impact. Such graphic creativity will surely put your brand ahead of the numerous counterparts on promotional business sites.</p>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1"><a href="#Method-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch"><a href="#Time-stretch" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes"><a href="#Using-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-1"><a href="#Method-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-1"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-1"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-1"><a href="#Time-stretch-1" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-1"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-1" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-1"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-1" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-1"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-2"><a href="#Method-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-2"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-2"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-2"><a href="#Time-stretch-2" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-2"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-2" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-2"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-2" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-2"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility.

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-3"><a href="#Method-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-3"><a href="#Time-stretch-3" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-3"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-3"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-3" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-3"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This tutorial looked at how to slow down a video in Premiere Pro using the Video Speed Controller plugin for Windows. It also emphasizes how Filmora may assist you in achieving your goal in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>Aside from video effects like as rapid motion and slow motion, Filmora also allows you to do some simple and complex editing tasks such as rotating, reversing, chroma-keying, etc.</p>
<p>WonderShare Filmora is a substantial improvement and redesign of the previous Filmora Video Editor, released in 2008. One of the most endearing aspects of Filmora has always been that, although having a robust set of functions, the developers stayed committed to making the program essential in the design and straightforward to learn and use.</p>
<p>A large number of new features have been included in WonderShare Filmora to meet customer demand, and it has been necessary to incorporate access to those functions into the user interface as well.</p>

<p>Stability is the key here, as the captured videos will be masked and combined in the later stages of the steps. To do so, consistently capturing the video in the same ratio is necessary. You can stabilize the video with a simple gorilla pod that you can get of good quality or a simple tripod.</p>
<h3 id="The-prop"><a href="#The-prop" class="headerlink" title="The prop"></a>The prop</h3><p>The prop will be the object that we will be flying in the video. It could be a fluffy toy, a ball, a box, or anything you desire to be flying in your video.</p>

<h3 id="Good-presentation"><a href="#Good-presentation" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to capture the footage?"></a>Part 2. How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video"><a href="#Reference-video" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video"><a href="#Main-video" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>

<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora effect editing panel"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h5 id="Step7Creating-the-popup-effect"><a href="#Step7Creating-the-popup-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step7Creating the popup effect"></a>Step7Creating the popup effect</h5><p>Now, if you want your object to appear out of thin air, you must create that pop-up effect. You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Final Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, click on <strong>Ok</strong> when done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play the clip from the start, and you will notice the ball popping up according to your action.</p>

<h3 id="Good-presentation-1"><a href="#Good-presentation-1" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>

How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video-1"><a href="#Reference-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif"
                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video-1"><a href="#Main-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>

<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect-1"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>

<h5 id="Step7Creating-the-popup-effect-1"><a href="#Step7Creating-the-popup-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7Creating the popup effect"></a>Step7Creating the popup effect</h5><p>Now, if you want your object to appear out of thin air, you must create that pop-up effect. You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="moving the mask to hide the ball"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Final Results:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, click on <strong>Ok</strong> when done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play the clip from the start, and you will notice the ball popping up according to your action.</p>

Below are some essential things to think about bringing perfection in slow-motion videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: A slow-motion video with visual appeal and a high resolution is crucial. This is especially vital if you intend to crop or zoom in on the video while editing.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you’re attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Editing:</strong> Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn’t slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.</li>
</ul>

Below are some essential things to think about bringing perfection in slow-motion videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: A slow-motion video with visual appeal and a high resolution is crucial. This is especially vital if you intend to crop or zoom in on the video while editing.</li>
<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you’re attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Editing:</strong> Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn’t slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="after adding a miniature effect"
                ></p>
<p>But first, let’s learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.</p>
<p>However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we’re seeing is actually a tiny model.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="a miniature effect for landscape"
                ></p>
<p>To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It utilizes <strong>selective blur</strong> to make things appear like <strong>small</strong></li>
<li>The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from <strong>a high angle</strong>.</li>
<li>The tiny effect is usually used in <strong>drone footage, time lapses</strong>, or <strong>landscape photography</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video present in 2nd track.</li>
<li>The settings tab will be open in the top left section.</li>
<li>Then find the <strong>Mask</strong> section and click on it.</li>
<li>After this, <strong>click</strong> on the <strong>Double-line</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.</p>
<p>Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotation of mask in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can’t get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Make a building or any object <strong>Blurry</strong> near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.</li>
<li>While the <strong>object is far</strong> from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.</li>
<li>Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.</li>
<li><strong>Settings</strong> will activate on the top left side.</li>
<li>Then click on the <strong>Mask</strong> tab to open it.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Rectangular</strong> mask from the list and apply it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the same stock video clip a <strong>third time</strong> on the third video track of the timeline.</li>
<li>Then add a mask in a <strong>Rectangle</strong> shape on the building.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>blur</strong> the edge of this mask.</li>
</ul>

<li>Open Filmora and select any stock footage in Wondershare Filmora.</li>
</ul>

<p>Move to the <strong>stock media</strong> folder on the above bar in the Wondershare Filmora. Or you can look towards the left window, where you will see the sample <strong>videos tab.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the sample videos tab, and a new <strong>window</strong> will appear on the library screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you will see almost more than <strong>20 videos.</strong> So, instead of using the actual recorded footage, we’ll make do with what we have by <strong>default</strong>. After selecting and adding the stock footage of your choice. Then you have to follow the below process:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, hold the Stock Footage as shown in the folder section.</li>
<li>Then <strong>Drag and Drop</strong> it to the timeline section for further editing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who will get Stock Media?</strong></p>
<p>Want to get stock media? You can only have access to the stock media library if you already buy the license of Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>latest version</strong> has an unlimited stock library.</li>

<h5 id="Step3-Head-to-the-effect-panel-1"><a href="#Step3-Head-to-the-effect-panel-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Head to the effect panel"></a>Step3 Head to the effect panel</h5><p>As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a <strong>Blur</strong> effect on the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, move toward the above tabs.</li>
<li>Then click on the 5th section, which is <strong>Effect</strong></li>
<li>After selecting the effect tab, a new window will <strong>pop up</strong>.</li>
<li>In this section, we have <strong>500+</strong> different effects.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>click</strong> on the search bar.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> for the Blur effect.</li>
<li>After that, click on the <strong>Blur 2</strong></li>
<li>Then <strong>Download</strong> this effect if you haven’t done this already.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-blur-effect-to-the-video-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-blur-effect-to-the-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the blur effect to the video"></a>Step4 Add the blur effect to the video</h5><p>After selecting and downloading the blur effect, it’s time to add it to the video. Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, drag</strong> and <strong>Drop</strong> the effect toward the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure that the <strong>opacity</strong> of the blur effect is 100%.</li>
<li>Then, if you still want more blurriness, add <strong>Blur 2</strong> effect multiple times on the video.</li>
<li>Finally, add effect by just the <strong>Drag and Drop</strong></li>
</ul>

</ul>

Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video present in 2nd track.</li>
<li>The settings tab will be open in the top left section.</li>
<li>Then find the <strong>Mask</strong> section and click on it.</li>
<li>After this, <strong>click</strong> on the <strong>Double-line</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-9.gif"
                      alt="add mask to the video on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.</p>
<p>Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif"
                      alt="rotation of mask in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can’t get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif"
                      alt="blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Make a building or any object <strong>Blurry</strong> near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.</li>
<li>While the <strong>object is far</strong> from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.</li>
<li>Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif"
                      alt="changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.</li>
<li><strong>Settings</strong> will activate on the top left side.</li>
<li>Then click on the <strong>Mask</strong> tab to open it.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Rectangular</strong> mask from the list and apply it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the same stock video clip a <strong>third time</strong> on the third video track of the timeline.</li>
<li>Then add a mask in a <strong>Rectangle</strong> shape on the building.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>blur</strong> the edge of this mask.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-13.gif"
                      alt="mask the object far from the camera for the main focus"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step8-Final-Look-1"><a href="#Step8-Final-Look-1" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Final Look"></a>Step8 Final Look</h5><p>You are excited now to see the final look of your miniature effect! Finally, it’s in front of you! Just modify it more if you want to make it more precise.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-14.gif"
                      alt="final look of miniature effect on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>

It is a very great cloud storage service and most people use it. Google Photos has introduced an artificial intelligence technology into the app. That’s why it can automatically organize and rotate.</p>
<p>You have videos on google photos that are automatically rotated, others are not.</p>
<p>How do you rotate them manually?</p>
<p>It’s is so simple and will not take much of your time.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<h2 id="Rotating-videos-in-google-photos"><a href="#Rotating-videos-in-google-photos" class="headerlink" title="Rotating videos in google photos"></a><strong>Rotating videos in google photos</strong></h2><p>Rotating a video in google photos is pretty simple and will not take much of your time. You can easily fix the rotation and aspect ratio of your videos. But it’s a little tricky.</p>
<p>I’m going to show you how to flip your videos from portrait mode to landscape mode or from landscape mode to portrait mode.</p>
<p>You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you’re going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You will see a diamond with a circular arrow on it. You’re going to hit that until you find the way you want it to be.</p>

                      alt="rotate-video-google-photos"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re happy, in the top right hand corner, hit Save Copy and that’s it, the size of the file determines how long it takes to finish this process later.</p>

<h2 id="An-easier-way-to-rotate-videos-in-Google-Photos"><a href="#An-easier-way-to-rotate-videos-in-Google-Photos" class="headerlink" title="An easier way to rotate videos in Google Photos"></a><strong>An easier way to rotate videos in Google Photos</strong></h2><p>If you just need to rotate a video in portrait mode to the landscape mode or 180 degrees, Google photos will be the best choice to do that.

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Here’s How to do it…</p>
<h3 id="Rotate-video-at-any-angle"><a href="#Rotate-video-at-any-angle" class="headerlink" title="Rotate video at any angle"></a>Rotate video at any angle</h3><p>You can also rotate the video by using the <strong>Transform</strong> tab located at the top right corner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag your video into the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
<li>Double click on the video to bring up the <strong>editing panel</strong>.</li>
<li>Hit the <strong>basic</strong> tab under the <strong>video</strong> tab in the menu bar.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Transform</strong></li>
<li>Click the <strong>rotate</strong></li>
<li>Here you can move the rotate slider or directly enter the rotating value.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-4.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-google-photos"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice that I have changed the rotation of my video from its original position to the rotated angle.</p>
<p>You can rotate upside down, rotate left, rotate right or 90 degrees clockwise, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, 360 degrees rotate, and back to the original. Check the video result in the preview window. Once you get satisfied with the rotation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the <strong>ok</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>save</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-5.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-google-photos"
                ></p>
<p>Similarly, you can drag the video from the preview panel and adjust it as required.</p>
<p>Here, you can <strong>Flip</strong> function your video to change the direction. Like in this screenshot, suppose you want to change the place from right to left. You can easily change the direction by hitting on the flip tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-6.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-google-photos"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can see that the image has flipped without making a big effort you can also do it. I have done it for you, you are smarter.</p>
<p>Just go ahead and start…</p>

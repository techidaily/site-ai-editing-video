<h3 id="How-To-Combine-Video-With-Two-Audio-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#How-To-Combine-Video-With-Two-Audio-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg"></a>How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg</h3><p>Are you looking to add multiple audio tracks to your video? With FFmpeg, you can easily combine video with two audio streams. Whether creating a foreign-language version of your video or adding an alternate audio track, this method will help you achieve professional results. This section will guide you through combining video with two audio streams using FFmpeg’s command-line interface. So, let’s get started!</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video</strong></p>
<p>Combining multiple audio tracks into one video can be done easily with FFmpeg’s command-line interface. In this example, we will combine two audio tracks into one video so that the voiceover will play over the background music. Here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Open</strong> your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your video and audio files are located.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Replace</strong> “<strong>video1.mp4</strong>“ and “<strong>audio1.mp3</strong>“ with the names of your actual video and audio files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p><em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step3 The <strong>-c:v copy</strong> flag tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream from the source file without re-encoding it. This helps to speed up the process and avoid quality loss.</p>
<p><em>-c:v copy \</em></p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 The command “<strong>amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest</strong>“ tells amix to accept 2 inputs (<strong>0:a and 1:a</strong>) and <strong>combine</strong> them into an output stream called <strong>audio_out</strong>, with the duration of the longest input.</p>
<p><em>[0:a][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Map</strong> the video stream <strong>(0:v)</strong> and the mixed audio stream <strong>(audio_out)</strong> into the final output video.</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step6 The <strong>-y flag</strong> tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>Once complete, you’ll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.</p>

<p>We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.</p>
<p>And here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Start</strong> the command by specifying the input files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> option to specify a filter graph.</p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a] volume&#x3D;0.5 [music];</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>amix</strong> filter to take the “<strong>music</strong>“ stream and <strong>audio1.mp3</strong> and <strong>mix</strong> them.</p>
<p> <em>[music][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>map</strong> option to <strong>specify</strong> which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.</p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Specify</strong> the output file name as “<strong>output.mp4</strong>“ and the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.</p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay</strong></p>
<p>When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here’s how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>adelay filter</strong> to add delay to the audio track.</p>
<p><em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice];</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Mix</strong> the delayed audio track with the original audio track</p>
<p><em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out]</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Map</strong> the video and audio tracks to the output file</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>The final command would look like this:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice]; \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.</p>

With FFmpeg, you can easily combine video with two audio streams. Whether creating a foreign-language version of your video or adding an alternate audio track, this method will help you achieve professional results. This section will guide you through combining video with two audio streams using FFmpeg’s command-line interface. So, let’s get started!</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video</strong></p>
<p>Combining multiple audio tracks into one video can be done easily with FFmpeg’s command-line interface. In this example, we will combine two audio tracks into one video so that the voiceover will play over the background music. Here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Open</strong> your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your video and audio files are located.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Replace</strong> “<strong>video1.mp4</strong>“ and “<strong>audio1.mp3</strong>“ with the names of your actual video and audio files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p><em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step3 The <strong>-c:v copy</strong> flag tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream from the source file without re-encoding it. This helps to speed up the process and avoid quality loss.</p>
<p><em>-c:v copy \</em></p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 The command “<strong>amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest</strong>“ tells amix to accept 2 inputs (<strong>0:a and 1:a</strong>) and <strong>combine</strong> them into an output stream called <strong>audio_out</strong>, with the duration of the longest input.</p>
<p><em>[0:a][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Map</strong> the video stream <strong>(0:v)</strong> and the mixed audio stream <strong>(audio_out)</strong> into the final output video.</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step6 The <strong>-y flag</strong> tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>Once complete, you’ll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video Adjusting Volume</strong></p>
<p>We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.</p>
<p>And here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Start</strong> the command by specifying the input files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> option to specify a filter graph.</p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a] volume&#x3D;0.5 [music];</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>amix</strong> filter to take the “<strong>music</strong>“ stream and <strong>audio1.mp3</strong> and <strong>mix</strong> them.</p>
<p> <em>[music][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>map</strong> option to <strong>specify</strong> which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.</p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Specify</strong> the output file name as “<strong>output.mp4</strong>“ and the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.</p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay</strong></p>
<p>When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here’s how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>adelay filter</strong> to add delay to the audio track.</p>
<p><em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice];</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Mix</strong> the delayed audio track with the original audio track</p>
<p><em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out]</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Map</strong> the video and audio tracks to the output file</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>The final command would look like this:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice]; \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.</p>

When designing an anime character, there are a series of aspects to be held into the light. Considering the fact that these elements add spark and engagement into the story being depicted, enough focus should be laid on crafting out the minute details that are essential to infuse liveliness and suitability into the character.</p>
<p>Anime characters are created to foretell a customary tale in a fantasizing manner, depicting all the superficial elements that you may possibly never imagine of coming across in real life. Another aspect is the animation element that happens to be the pivot of anime designing. All these put together on a single palette work to bring out an amazing anime story to life. But that’s not all.</p>
<p>No doubt on the significance of the aforesaid elements in crafting the most perfect anime design, but an essential fact that naturally goes unnoticed is the creator’s own interpretations and thoughts about the specific anime characters that are responsible for delivering a captivating story. Talking of specific character design, the key is to include the exact and accurate details of style, physical features, body language, costumes and other nuances that are crucial factors to comment on how the audience relates and responds to the character.</p>
<p>Respecting the diversity in the realm of <strong>anime design</strong>, each character tends to portray a completely distinguished appeal from the others. As of the likehood factor, while some characters receive a moderate attention, there are others who conveniently succeed in creating a long lasting impact. Moving ahead with our discussion along the same line, let us talk about some of the most loved and stand out anime character designs in what follows next:</p>
<h3 id="01My-Hero-Academia"><a href="#01My-Hero-Academia" class="headerlink" title="01My Hero Academia"></a>01My Hero Academia</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Character design has a significant influence of Western comics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Special attention is paid on the hair styling and costume selection of each character</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The characters have a unique color crafting for a stand out recognition</p>

Moving along the line, this anime artwork dedicates itself to follow the exact footprints of the Western caricature art form in every aspect of character improvisation, right from color crafting to dynamic styling.</p>
<p>Another significant element of character design that is laid special focus on by the aforesaid anime flick, of course in cohesion with the Western comics is the hairstyle and costumes of the characters.

<p><strong>●</strong> The series is a classic school level anime series with a reflective character design</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character formations have a minute and distinguished detailing in physical features and body language</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The costumes, shade summaries and specific personality etiquettes work to set up a subtle communication among the characters</p>
<p>Centered greatly on school level anime creation, the most reflective aspects of Kyoto Animation character designs are present in the quick apparel changes and impressive body language. For instance, a simple flip of the hair can say a lot about a character’s personality of being lazy or active. It is however, interesting to note that Kyoto Animation did not have a significant recognition in character design before the advent of Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid.</p>
<p>The aforesaid anime series opened massive doors for the animation company to try hands at experimenting with the epic cuteness that the latter is known for in today’s times. Be it the character costumes, color patterns, or even a quick shine in the eye, everything works so perfectly to build up a subtle communication among the dragon girls of this series.</p>
<p>The minute detailing works to highlight the differences between the respective personalities of these characters, along with setting each one miles apart from the other in a hoard of aspects.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>animation character design</strong> of this anime series is inspired by the art style of Studio Trigger</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The best thing about the aforesaid character formations is the flawless homogeneity among the apparel design, color coding and line work</p>

<p>One of the 3 major anime productions that have incorporated the Shonen Jump’s style of character design, Naruto is credited with the depicting the best play of art through its set of the closest resembling characters.

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design.

It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>

It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement.

                ></p>
<p>It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other.

Such color arrangements are the preferences of almost any popular anime character you normally come across.</p>

                ></p>
<p>It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design.

<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details.

<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing.

<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

<h3 id="03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design-2"><a href="#03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design"></a>03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design</h3><p>Adhere to the following guide for a stepwise assistance towards creating your own anime character design in a quick time span:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Creating a Character Outline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement. You can however, add a tint of complementary shades when creating a character design for a cover page. When proceeding to open the color palette for your character design, there are a variety of aspects worth paying attention.</p>

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Selecting the Perfect Color Scheme"
                ></p>
<p>It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other. When picking complementary colors; look for the shades that lie across of each other on the color wheel. Such color arrangements are the preferences of almost any popular anime character you normally come across.</p>

<h3 id="03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design-3"><a href="#03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design"></a>03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design</h3><p>Adhere to the following guide for a stepwise assistance towards creating your own anime character design in a quick time span:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Creating a Character Outline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/10-amazing-anime-character-designs-to-inspire-you-15.JPG"
                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Creating Rough Character Sketches"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement. You can however, add a tint of complementary shades when creating a character design for a cover page. When proceeding to open the color palette for your character design, there are a variety of aspects worth paying attention.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/10-amazing-anime-character-designs-to-inspire-you-17.JPG"
                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Selecting the Perfect Color Scheme"
                ></p>
<p>It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other. When picking complementary colors; look for the shades that lie across of each other on the color wheel. Such color arrangements are the preferences of almost any popular anime character you normally come across.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

        Shades"
                ></p>
<p>It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

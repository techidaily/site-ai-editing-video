<p>Step2 Then, drag and drop the color-corrected video clip on the second video track. Ensure that the clips are piled on top of one another so they may all be played simultaneously. It will make it easier for us to trim the footage.</p>

<h3 id="Dissolve-Effect"><a href="#Dissolve-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Dissolve Effect"></a>Dissolve Effect</h3><p>The dissolve effect allows us to shift from one shot to another by using slow block dissolution. It gives the impression that one scene is being morphed into another. And, it is frequently used in documentaries.</p>
<p>We may utilize the dissolve transition to display the differences between two video segments more naturally. To explain the objective of the dissolve effect, we used two clips of the same place shot at separate times. The first film is current, but the second is from the same place but was taken a few years back.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to apply the Dissolve effect</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Drag and drop the first video clip onto the timeline’s first video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag and drop the first video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Then, on the second video track, drag and drop the second video clip. Make sure the start of the second clip is where you want the transition to begin.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag and drop the second video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Then Go to the Transitions window and choose the “Dissolve” effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose the dissolve effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Drag the transition to the start of the second video clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-10.jpg"
                      alt="drag the transition to the start of the second video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Then, on the timeline, double-click the transition to open the settings box. If necessary, adjust the duration of the “Dissolve “ effect as needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-click the transition to open the settings box"
                ></p>
<p>You can see how it looks in the image below. If we play the timeline, we can watch the green court convert into the old basketball court. However, the two visuals don’t truly match each other during the transformation.</p>
<h5 id="Steps-to-adjust-the-frames-of-the-clips"><a href="#Steps-to-adjust-the-frames-of-the-clips" class="headerlink" title="Steps to adjust the frames of the clips"></a>Steps to adjust the frames of the clips</h5><p>Step1 We may fix it by adjusting the location and scale of the clips.</p>
<p>Step2 Move the play head to the transition section to watch both video segments.</p>
<p>Step3 To open the settings window, double-click on the first video.</p>
<p>Step4 Find the transform section and scale it to 110%.</p>
<p>Step5 Then, move the first video’s frame to match the second video’s placement. We may notice a more natural transition when we replay the timeline.</p>
<h3 id="Split-Screen-Effect"><a href="#Split-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Split Screen Effect"></a>Split Screen Effect</h3><p>The split-screen technique first appeared in the film “The Queen of Spades,” which was released in 1949. It depicted a man suffering from a psychological illness. The split-screen effect was used to demonstrate the contrast between reality and his hallucinations. It made the viewer more aware of what was actually happening in the film.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-12.jpg"
                      alt="split screen effect"
                ></p>
<p>Since then, the split screen has been used as the simplest technique to demonstrate the before&#x2F;after comparison. This effect is also ideal for emphasizing the changes in only one section of the video.</p>
<p>Because the split screen effect does not display the whole frame of the video clips, you may eliminate the top and bottom bars of the video clips using this effect.</p>
<p><strong>How to apply a split screen effect?</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Find “Split Screen1” in the window by clicking “Split Screen.”</p>
<p>Step2 Drag it over to the timeline.</p>
<p>Step3 You’ll see the split-screen template in the preview box when you double-click it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="split-screen template"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Drag the two video clips you wish to compare to the template’s left and right sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag the two video clips"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 If necessary, you may also adjust the location of the videos in the preview clip.</p>
<p>Step6 Finally, uncheck the option labeled “allow split screen animation.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="uncheck the option labeled allow split screen animation"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 All of the steps for the before&#x2F;after split screen are now complete.</p>
<p>Step8 Let’s wait and see how it turns out!</p>

<p>First of all, you need to install the <strong>slideshow maker no watermark</strong> that you want. Pick a slideshow maker of your choice as per the features you need to work with. After choosing the slideshow maker, install it from internet and allow your device to run the application.</p>
<p><strong>Pick a template</strong></p>
<p>After installing the slideshow maker, explore it. See the features available, template and media library and themes you can use. After going through the templates and themes, pick a template with them you want to make your slideshow on and go to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Upload your files</strong></p>
<p>Upload your photos and arrange them in the order you want. In most of the slideshow makers, you will get the option of sliding pictures and rearranging them. You can also insert text on pictures after this step.</p>
<p><strong>Apply effects, filters and transitions</strong></p>
<p>Your basic slideshow is ready. Now apply effects, filters and transitions to make your slideshow beautiful. The theme itself comes with the effects sometimes; for example; if you choose holiday theme, romance or party, the theme will come with effects and filters accordingly. But you can customize it as per your choice and apply filters and effects according to your preference. Then check transition library and apply the one that attract you. You can also use different transitions for different set of pictures.</p>

<p>Wondershare Filmora is a proper selection if you are looking for trimming or want to split your videos. Following are the steps in complete detail regarding cutting the videos simply and a short time:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Your video clips are on your timeline when you click on “Import” and drag them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In this step, selecting the clip is essential after dragging the video on the timeline. Keep moving the play head at the correct location from the ending of the first area and the starting of the other one. Now, you need to click on the “Split” button (the scissor icon is visible on the toolbar). It is for separating the videos into parts. You can also use this step with even larger video clips to make small video clips.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Save the video in the format of your choice. Select the format from the list available on the export window. After saving the clips from the complete video, it is easier to load the project again and export it individually.</p>

It would make getting ready in the morning much faster! This tutorial will show you how to use the keyframe and mask feature in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make a remarkable night-to-day transition.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How-to Guide"></a>How-to Guide</h2><p><strong><em>1) Preparation</em></strong></p>
<p>For this effect, you will need to shoot two footage shots with the same frame. The first is for the daytime clip, and the second is for nighttime.</p>
<p>But before that, you need to prepare some things, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tripod to ensure your camera stays at the same point, so the frame doesn’t change.</li>
<li>Mark the place where you want to shoot the scene. You can put a marker on the floor to ensure that you perform at the same spot in different shots.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once done, let’s start shooting to get the footage.</p>
<p><strong><em>2) Steps</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Shooting footages</strong></p>
<p>First, get the daytime shot. For this tutorial, we will pretend that you are walking and transitioning into nighttime at the spot you have marked.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-1.gif"
                      alt="get the daytime shot"
                ></p>
<p>Now, let’s film the nighttime clip. You will walk through the living room and do the same movement again at the same spot. You can dim the light and change the camera’s white balance settings to bluer to create a night feeling.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-2.gif"
                      alt="film the nighttime clip"
                ></p>
<p>After you have both clips that you need, let’s go to Filmora and start editing.</p>
<p><strong>Night-to-day transition</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Launch Filmora and import the footage into the program. If you haven’t installed it, you can download Filmora on their website here: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/" >https://filmora.wondershare.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Step2 Place the nighttime video clip on the first video track of the timeline and place the daytime clip on the top.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-3.jpg"
                      alt="place the daytime clip on the top"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Find the spot where you want to create a transition between the day and nighttime. Then, you can delete the unwanted part.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-4.jpg"
                      alt="create a transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Since the transition for this tutorial is where the subject started waving, make sure to place the daytime clip at the same time the subject started waving in the nighttime clip. Hence, the timing in both clips syncs.</p>
<p><strong>Masking transition</strong></p>
<p>For the next step, we will make a masking transition with the Filmora mask feature.</p>
<p>Step1 Double-click the daytime clip on the timeline. In the Filmora setting, find the <strong>Mask section &gt; Circle</strong>. You can see the mask is applied in the preview screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-5.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the daytime clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Scroll down the setting and click add a keyframe at the beginning of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-6.jpg"
                      alt="scroll down the setting"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Change the scale of the mask to the smallest number and adjust the Width and Height down to 0. You can set the blur strength to 15 to make the transition edge smoother.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-7.jpg"
                      alt="change the scale of the mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Move the play head to find the spot where you want the mask fully opens up, then add another keyframe. Change the scale of the mask to 2 and the Width and Height to 50. Make sure the mask occupies the whole frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-8.jpg"
                      alt="add another keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>Now, if you play back, you can see the nighttime becomes daytime through the mask.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-9.gif"
                      alt="nighttime becomes daytime through the mask"
                ></p>
<p>If the movement in the two clips is a bit off, you can fix it by adding more keyframes on the mask.</p>
<p><strong><em>3) Pro tips</em></strong></p>
<p>You can add one more effect in Filmora to make it more magical. To do this, open the Effects window on the top left and find “Heartbeat” under the Basic section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-10.jpg"
                      alt="add one more effect in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Drag and drop it onto the third video track and start the effect when the mask opens up. Then, trim the effect length to match the movement. Adjust the speed of this effect if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-11.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the speed of this effect"
                ></p>
<p>The final result will look like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-12.gif"

<p>Birthdays come only once a year, and at this time of the year, we want to make our loved ones feel special and loved by praying for them, wishing them well, getting them presents, throwing parties, and other stuff people do to celebrate birthdays. You can also make the best of this celebration by doing something special. A birthday slideshow showing all of the celebrant’s fondest moments sounds like a perfect gift to me. A birthday photo slideshow has all the celebrant’s favorite memories, vacation photos, favorite pets, and interests.

Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

</ol>
<p>Yes, GoPro has its own video editor “Quik”. It is available on mobile phones and desktops both. It is simple and easy to use. It provides basic features to edit your video.

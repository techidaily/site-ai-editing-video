It may go from basic editing to VFX and so on. Speed ramping is also an important feature of editing. Creators who make cinematics or B-rolls often may have used this feature.</p>
<p>Changing the speed of the whole video doesn’t look good in most situations therefore speed ramping feature was created. Speed Ramping means gradually changing the speed of a clip over time. It isn’t a complex thing but doing it correctly in the right amount at the right time can change the feel of the whole video. It catches the attention of viewers through different scenes of a clip.</p>
<p>So, here we have mentioned some iPhone video editing softwares that can at least do basic speed changes. but most of them can also do advanced speed ramping. These are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Filmora Go:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is available on IOS and Android both.</strong></p>
<p>Want to do speed ramping? use Filmora Go. But are you a content creator and want to do more than just video editing? I would still recommend “Filmora Go”. Because it is such a versatile and easy-to-use software made by Wondershare. Like its PC software, it is also packed with many cool features such as chroma key, mask, keyframing, blending, e.t.c. It also supports multiple layers. It has built-in effects, transitions, and presets to speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>It is a paid video editor but you can try it for free, free trial includes most of the features but it leaves a watermark on export.</p>
<p><strong>~Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has speed curves for smooth speed ramping.</li>
<li>Supports multiple images and video layers.</li>
<li>Have many presets and filters for fast pace editing.</li>
<li>Have cool features like chroma key, masking, keyframing, e.t.c.</li>
<li>Supports “Pixabay’s” stock library.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>

This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.</p>
<p>You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom"></a>Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom</h2><p>VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.</p>
<p>Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.</p>
<p>Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.</p>
<p>Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.</p>
<p>Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.</p>

                      alt="zoom in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.</p>

While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.</p>
<p>Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.</p>
<p>Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>3. Organize your Audio Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects</h5><p>The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_12.jpg"

You can add all the clapping sounds, laughing, and all kinds of other foley sound here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg"

<h2 id="Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency"><a href="#Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency"></a>Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency</h2><p><strong>1. Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>

Production sound is usually the sound that is recorded on set. If you have recorded all dialects from the subjects on the location, you can put them into this folder.</p>

<p><strong>2. Organize your Timeline and Video Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Picture-Editing-1"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Picture-Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing</h5><p>Keep the first three tracks for picture editing. These tracks are usually for picture editing that includes footage with no effects or some simple effects—for example resizing, keyframing, transitions, or Green Screen.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_8.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for temporary footage"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Effects-1"><a href="#Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Create Tracks for Effects"></a>Step3 Create Tracks for Effects</h5><p>Set the fifth video track as the effect track. It will include all effects from firmware that do not apply to the footage directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

In this example, you can put the subtitles here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>3. Organize your Audio Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects-1"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects</h5><p>The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

If you don’t have a voiceover in your video, you can leave it empty.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_12.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for additional audio"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Sound-Effects-1"><a href="#Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Sound-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects"></a>Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects</h5><p>The fourth track could usually be the sound effects track. You can add all the clapping sounds, laughing, and all kinds of other foley sound here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_13.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for sound effects"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step4-Create-Tracks-for-Ambient-Sound-1"><a href="#Step4-Create-Tracks-for-Ambient-Sound-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound"></a>Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound</h5><p>Keep the fifth track for Ambient sound and room tone. You can use it to keep a very subtle environment sound in specific scenes. For example, you can use the room tone recorded on sets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

But, of course, you could also keep it empty if your project has no background music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_15.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for background music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg"
                      alt="color code your clips"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency-1"><a href="#Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency"></a>Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency</h2><p><strong>1. Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>

<h5 id="Step1-Upload-the-Video-to-Kapwing"><a href="#Step1-Upload-the-Video-to-Kapwing" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Upload the Video to Kapwing"></a>Step1 Upload the Video to Kapwing</h5><p>You can open Kapwing with the device and tap on “Start Editing” to open up Kapwimg studio. After that, one can use the drag and drop option to upload the video in the studio. You can click on upload or use the link to upload.</p>
<p>If you have a more than 250 MB video, then you will require the Pro version.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-the-Text"><a href="#Step2-Add-the-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Add the Text"></a>Step2 Add the Text</h5><p>When the video gets uploaded, now you can add your text. You must click the “Text” option on the left and type the text. After that, you can pick your favorite color, background, and color to add style.</p>
<p>You will always want that your text to get animated, but it doesn’t mean that you will have to use explosive fonts or funky or bright, which are very funky. The animation will make your text look attractive, and you can experiment with the colors and fonts to find the best combination.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Animate-the-Text"><a href="#Step3-Animate-the-Text" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Animate the Text"></a>Step3 Animate the Text</h5><p>Now the fun part starts; choose the text box present on the right side and click on the “Animate” tab.

<p>Use “Apply To” for applying this animation in the outro, intro, or both. It will help you to make the text fade out, fade in, or transition out and in with animation. Now the animation library has nine options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drop</strong>: It appears on top of the text box</li>
<li><strong>Flicker</strong>: This one is like a candle’s flicker, and text flashes disappear and appear before staying.</li>
<li><strong>Fade</strong>: Opacity can be changed from 0% to 100%.</li>
<li><strong>Pop:-</strong> This grows the text more extensive than the text box and shrinks back to the place.</li>
<li><strong>Reveal:-</strong> Rolls from the left side to the right side</li>
<li><strong>Wipe:-</strong> Rolls from the left side to the right side with a colored background.</li>
<li><strong>Vibrate:</strong> The text box shakes in every direction.</li>
<li><strong>Hue rotates:-</strong> Colour of text cycles through the hue values..</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use a timeline to adjust the animation’s termination when you set text animation. You can even drag that layer after the start time or use it on end&#x2F;start time sliders to decrease or increase the time of your video. Text animation can get started when the cursor reaches the start time.</p>

<h3 id="Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Using Track Mattes in After Effects"></a>Using Track Mattes in After Effects</h3><p>In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p>

                      alt="alpha track matte"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p>

Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p>

<h5 id="Step-3-1"><a href="#Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set “Mask Mode” from the timeline to “Subtract.” This will remove the selected object from the clip.</p>

<h3 id="Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Using Track Mattes in After Effects"></a>Using Track Mattes in After Effects</h3><p>In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p>

                      alt="alpha track matte"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h5 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3-2"><a href="#Step-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p>

Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-3"><a href="#Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set “Mask Mode” from the timeline to “Subtract.” This will remove the selected object from the clip.</p>

<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you.

<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>

<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>

                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>
<p><img

Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

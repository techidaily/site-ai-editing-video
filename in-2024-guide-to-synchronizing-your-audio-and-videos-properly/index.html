This can happen because of technical issues or frame rate mismatches. In case you somehow get unsynchronized audio in the video, you need to use a reliable video editor to cater to this issue. To help you with this issue, this article will provide the best-in-class video editor named Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>The key features and the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >smooth and sleek interface <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> show that you will have optimized audio synchronization with videos. Along with the auto beat sync feature, we will also discuss some online alternatives that will assist you in syncing audio while online.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Should-You-Synchronize-Your-Audio-And-Videos-in-Video-Editing"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Should-You-Synchronize-Your-Audio-And-Videos-in-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?"></a>Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?</h2><p>Audio and video synchronization is important for presenting a good quality viewing experience. Here are the main reasons you shouldn’t neglect this in your audio and video.</p>
<h3 id="Lip-Sync-and-Narrative-Flow"><a href="#Lip-Sync-and-Narrative-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Lip Sync and Narrative Flow"></a>Lip Sync and Narrative Flow</h3><p>Synchronizing audio and video is crucial to maintaining the film’s narrative flow. Well-synchronized audio and video offer a very smooth experience to the viewers. If the lips and dialogue flow are not well maintained, it can cause distraction in the storytelling. As a result, the real message won’t be conveyed to the viewers.</p>
<h3 id="Viewer-Engagement"><a href="#Viewer-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="Viewer Engagement"></a>Viewer Engagement</h3><p>Do you wish to ensure that your viewers pay full attention to your video and that your message is well conveyed? Your video quality and sound matter the most for the best experience. When the audio and video are well-synced, the viewers pay attention to the content. They are not distracted due to the bad quality of the video.</p>
<h3 id="Value-of-Quality-Production"><a href="#Value-of-Quality-Production" class="headerlink" title="Value of Quality Production"></a>Value of Quality Production</h3><p>A high-quality video with perfect sound quality and proper syncing builds a good perception. If the video quality is bad or does not have proper sync, it can leave a bad impression. Therefore, to enhance the impact of these emotional and dramatic effects, it is imperative to focus on these core things.</p>
<h3 id="Professionalism-and-Quality"><a href="#Professionalism-and-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Professionalism and Quality"></a>Professionalism and Quality</h3><p>To make your viewer experience outstanding, focus on paying attention to details. A good quality video represents your professionalism and the standards of your production. When it is synchronized, the viewer will always see this as a high-quality creation.</p>

This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.</p>

Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>
<p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p>

Color correction ensures that your video doesn’t remain flat or unexciting.</p>
<p>○ Create Your LUTs</p>
<p>LUT allows you to save specific color grades to use anytime you need them. This helps to save time by ensuring that you don’t develop color spaces all over again when working on various footage. You can also download as many free LUTs as you like.</p>
<p>○ Bring In a LUT</p>
<p>After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It’s that simple!</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion"><a href="#3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion" class="headerlink" title="3. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?"></a>3. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?</h4><p>The short answer is a big YES. You can apply multiple LUTs in LumaFusion.</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply your first LUT</li>
<li>Export the LUT</li>
<li>Access rendered movies</li>

This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.</p>
<p>With color grading, you can adjust your video’s color balance, saturation, contrast, luminance, black level, etc. It helps to evoke the particular emotions or moods that you want your videos to exude.</p>
<p>These are the essential things to note about color grading in LumaFusion:</p>
<h4 id="1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading-3"><a href="#1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?"></a>1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>
<p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p>
<p>Fortunately, LumaFusion allows you to import and apply LUT (look-up tables). With LumaFusion LUTs, you can color grade your footage to your satisfaction.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-To-Color-Grade-in-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#2-How-To-Color-Grade-in-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How To Color Grade in LumaFusion"></a>2. How To Color Grade in LumaFusion</h4><p>This is how to color grade your videos:</p>
<p>○ First, Color Correct</p>
<p>When attempting to color grade your footage, it’s essential that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >color correct <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it first. Color correction ensures that your video doesn’t remain flat or unexciting.</p>
<p>○ Create Your LUTs</p>
<p>LUT allows you to save specific color grades to use anytime you need them. This helps to save time by ensuring that you don’t develop color spaces all over again when working on various footage. You can also download as many free LUTs as you like.</p>
<p>○ Bring In a LUT</p>
<p>After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It’s that simple!</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?"></a>3. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?</h4><p>The short answer is a big YES. You can apply multiple LUTs in LumaFusion.</p>
<p>Here’s how t go o about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply your first LUT</li>
<li>Export the LUT</li>
<li>Access rendered movies</li>
<li>Apply the second LUT</li>
</ol>
<p>There is numerous manipulation you can do with LUT. For example, you can merge two or more LUTs into one.</p>

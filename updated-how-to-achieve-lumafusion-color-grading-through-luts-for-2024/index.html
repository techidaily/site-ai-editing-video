<p>Step5 Open the preset drop-down menu. There will be a lot of presets with different colors. Select the preset you want to use. In this scenario, let us select Just Blue.</p>

                      alt="adjusting the range slider"

It can sample colors from anywhere in a video or an image and add them to your swatch panel. The steps to use the eyedropper tool to add a selective color to your video are below.</p>
<p>Step1 As same as the first one, launching Wondershare Filmora is the first priority. And drag your clip to the timeline.</p>

<p>Step3 Find the selective color effect and drag it to the clip.</p>

                      alt="selective color"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double-click on the clip and visit the effects menu at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="opening effects menu"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Click on the ‘first color’ and select the eye dropper tool. This will allow us to select the red flower in the preview window. You can also click different parts of the image to get the color that we want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the first color and eye dropper tool"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="clicking on the second color"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Pick the eyedropper tool and click it on the green part of the clip. Then adjust the range slider as needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjusting range slider"
                ></p>
<p>Alright, let’s watch back the video to see how both colors are now isolated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="flower color isolated"
                ></p>
<p>Follow all the steps in the correct order. This is how you can use NewBlue effects for color isolation using Wondershare Filmora. The color isolation using the selective color effect defines the point of interest in the clip for the viewers.</p>

<p>Step4 Next, double-click on the clip and check out the effects menu at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-5.jpg"
                      alt="effects menu"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Open the preset drop-down menu. There will be a lot of presets with different colors. Select the preset you want to use. In this scenario, let us select Just Blue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-6.jpg"
                      alt="select the preset"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 If you see a blue tint at a place or object which you want to be white and black, click on the first color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-7.jpg"
                      alt="first color"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Now adjust the range slider to decrease the number of unwanted tints.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-8.jpg"
                      alt="adjusting the range slider"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 To blur the edges of the effects, turn up the softened slider and remove any unwanted tint previously remaining.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-9.jpg"
                      alt="blurring the edges of effects"
                ></p>
<p>In this way, you can add a selective color effect to your video clips and isolate the color of your choice.</p>
<h2 id="Tutorial-2-on-make-color-isolation-using-eyedropper-tool-1"><a href="#Tutorial-2-on-make-color-isolation-using-eyedropper-tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Tutorial 2 on make color isolation using eyedropper tool"></a>Tutorial 2 on make color isolation using eyedropper tool</h2><p>You might ask how do we use the eyedropper tool here. It can sample colors from anywhere in a video or an image and add them to your swatch panel. The steps to use the eyedropper tool to add a selective color to your video are below.</p>
<p>Step1 As same as the first one, launching Wondershare Filmora is the first priority. And drag your clip to the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-10.jpg"
                      alt="drag clip to timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Go to effects at the top, and find Newblue effects, and click on the Newblue filters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-11.jpg"
                      alt="newblue effects and filters"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Find the selective color effect and drag it to the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-12.jpg"
                      alt="selective color"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double-click on the clip and visit the effects menu at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-13.jpg"
                      alt="opening effects menu"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Click on the ‘first color’ and select the eye dropper tool. This will allow us to select the red flower in the preview window. You can also click different parts of the image to get the color that we want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-14.jpg"
                      alt="select the first color and eye dropper tool"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-15.jpg"
                      alt="clicking on the second color"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Pick the eyedropper tool and click it on the green part of the clip. Then adjust the range slider as needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-16.jpg"
                      alt="adjusting range slider"
                ></p>
<p>Alright, let’s watch back the video to see how both colors are now isolated.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-17.jpg"
                      alt="flower color isolated"
                ></p>
<p>Follow all the steps in the correct order. This is how you can use NewBlue effects for color isolation using Wondershare Filmora. The color isolation using the selective color effect defines the point of interest in the clip for the viewers.</p>

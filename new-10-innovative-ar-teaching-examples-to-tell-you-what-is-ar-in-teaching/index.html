<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning"><a href="#03Practical-Learning" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning"><a href="#04Combined-Learning" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable"><a href="#05Affordable" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>

The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-2"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-2" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-2"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-2"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-2"><a href="#05Affordable-2" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>

The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-2"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-2" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-3"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-3"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-3" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-3"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-3"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-3" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-3"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-3" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-3"><a href="#05Affordable-3" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-3"><a href="#Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples"></a>Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples</h2><p>Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, <strong>AR classrooms</strong> have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-3"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-3" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video"></a>Part 3. The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video</h2><p>Hope the above part will prove helpful to you in terms of adjusting the TikTok video using Wondershare Filmora. Now, let’s see what the common reasons which hinder users from adjusting the length of TikTok Videos are:</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Video-is-Too-Short"><a href="#1-The-Video-is-Too-Short" class="headerlink" title="1. The Video is Too Short"></a>1. The Video is Too Short</h3><p>Most TikTok users worry about <strong>why they can’t adjust TikTok clip length.</strong> The common reason behind this query is the short length of the video. If your video length is 3 seconds, then it would not be possible to shorten it further on TikTok. Thus, try to make a Video of at least 15 seconds to upload it on TikTok successfully.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Video-is-Too-Long"><a href="#2-The-Video-is-Too-Long" class="headerlink" title="2. The Video is Too Long"></a>2. The Video is Too Long</h3><p>If you have recorded a too-long video, it would not be possible to adjust its length on TikTok. Too long videos, especially more than 10 minutes, are less likely to be modified by TikTok. For that, you can take the help of Filmora to adjust its size. Filmora will trim the video to a suitable length within seconds.</p>
<h3 id="3-Using-Green-Screen-or-Other-Incompatible-Effects"><a href="#3-Using-Green-Screen-or-Other-Incompatible-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3. Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects"></a>3. Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects</h3><p>Sometimes people use those effects in videos that are difficult to edit. For example, using a green screen creates some technical issues in your video, which gets weirder when you try to adjust the length of such a video. Due to this, proper adjustments in such videos are difficult to do on TikTok.</p>
<h3 id="4-App-Glitch"><a href="#4-App-Glitch" class="headerlink" title="4. App Glitch"></a>4. App Glitch</h3><p>As many people are engaged in using TikTok, so sometimes the app slows down. It becomes pretty difficult to adjust the length of TikTok videos when the app shows glitches. However, on Filmora, the case is totally the opposite. You will never face any difficulty, no matter how many users are using it.</p>

<p>If you want to rearrange the order of the selected images, you can do so by clicking on the ‘Edit’ tab in the toolbar at the top, followed by choosing the ‘Sort’ option from the dropdown that follows next. The app sets the images in a natural logical order, while also allowing you to rearrange them manually.</p>

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Images"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Include a Background Music</strong></p>
<p>To complement your <strong>Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate</strong> presentation with a suitable background audio, visit the top toolbar and click on the ‘Add’ tab and select ‘Background Music’ from the list of options that appears next. A series of music titles will appear as you click on the ‘+’ icon in the ‘Background Music’ interface. You are allowed to reset the order of the listed music files through a mouse click.</p>
<p>If you want to remove the music titles, click on the ‘Trash Bin’ icon beside the ‘+’ button. To adjust the settings of a particular music tile, click on the same and make suitable parameter adjustments. When you are satisfied with the changes, click ‘OK’. Your final selections of the background music will appear in the app’s project timeline.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Including Background Music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the default arrangements, you can also proceed to make adjustments in the transition play duration and even customize a transition style of your own with text and effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Playing the Presentation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Adjust Your Image Properties</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Add Suitable Transitions</strong></p>
<p>If the randomly included transitions of the slideshow program do not suit your presentation style, choose to add your preferred one from the software’s ‘Transition Library’ and tap the ‘Adjust’ button to customise the properties of your selection. You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Transitions"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Images’ menu and hit the ‘Text’ tab to include text add-on within the slideshow images while formatting them suitably. You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button. To present a combined play of text and image, while avoiding the separate text animation, click on the ‘Show Text with Image’ checkbox at the bottom right corner of the ‘Images’ menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Add Comments to the Images</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Sound’ tab and enable your system’s microphone to add recorded comments to your slideshow. Start with clicking on the ‘Record’ button and narrate the comment. Don’t worry about the sync of image and comment play durations as the software program will automatically adjust both to be in line with each other.</p>
<p>If you are interested to add a particular sound file to a specific image, navigate to the ‘Yellow Folder’ at the top right corner to make your selection.</p>

<p><strong>Step 10: Adding Effects to the Images</strong></p>
<p>To complement the images of your <strong>Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate 12</strong> presentation with stunning images, navigate to the toolbar at the bottom of the editing workspace and click on the ‘Image Effects’ icon. To add the effect, drag it to a desired image in the project timeline. When you have reached the right place, drop the effect to apply it. To see the effect preview, navigate to the ‘Layout Designer Panel’ at the left, where you can find your image with the chosen effect.</p>

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Image Effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Collage Creation</strong></p>
<p>Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>
<p>Move ahead with expanding the collage, to ensure a proper display of the images. You can further, apply selected transitions to the created collage under the latter’s ‘Object Settings’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Creating an Image Collage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12: Edit Your Collage</strong></p>
<p>Start with selecting the first image of your collage and adjusting its size in the ‘Layout Designer’ through the position frame at the edges of the photo. Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Editing the Collage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13: Including a Chapter</strong></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with a single image track, proceed to add chapters to your presentation. Start with selecting the ‘Chapter’ object from the ‘Object Toolbar’ to insert the former in the timeline, followed by dragging 2 images into the same. Tap the ‘Play’ button to open the chapter and add suitable text and animation to it in similar way as you would do for a collage. Position the images at the desired place using the red ‘Position Bar’.</p>

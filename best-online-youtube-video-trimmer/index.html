            <h2 id="Best-Online-YouTube-Video-Trimmer"><a href="#Best-Online-YouTube-Video-Trimmer" class="headerlink" title="Best Online YouTube Video Trimmer"></a>Best Online YouTube Video Trimmer</h2><p>Since the shift in interest from on-site jobs to content creators and exploring opportunities to take advantage of better and improved career growth opportunities, YouTube is one of the most popular social media platforms to get started.</p>
<p>But how do people face difficulties in finding an affordable and quick online YouTube video trimmer? Are you also facing issues with trimming your video before uploading it to get more views?</p>
<p>This is an ultimate guide on <strong>online</strong> <strong>YouTube video trimmer</strong> software and how you can trim your YouTube videos in no time.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-YouTube-trimmer"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-YouTube-trimmer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a YouTube trimmer?"></a>Part 1. What is a YouTube trimmer?</h2><p>Before diving into any details, it is important to introduce you to what is a YouTube trimmer and why it is important to trim your video. A YouTube trimmer is an easy and fast video editing tool that allows you to trim, crop, and share your favorite video parts online. You can also create custom links to YouTube Crops to embed on your website.</p>
<p>There are two popular online YouTube trimmers available; one only allows you to edit the YouTube link, which means you can only view the edited video online, while the other allows you to do related operations on the video file and download and save it as an mp4 or other file type for offline viewing.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-online-trim-YouTube-videos"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-online-trim-YouTube-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to online trim YouTube videos?"></a>Part 2. How to online trim YouTube videos?</h2><h3 id="1-Online-YouTube-trimmer-no-edit-and-download"><a href="#1-Online-YouTube-trimmer-no-edit-and-download" class="headerlink" title="1. Online YouTube trimmer (no edit and download)"></a>1. Online YouTube trimmer (no edit and download)</h3><p>Using these two websites, you can easily find the YouTube video clip you want to keep, but there is no way to download the video or add more editing to the clip. However, it works well for sharing links online or adding them to your website and using them to describe the part that best fits the topic.</p>

</ol>
<p>The straightforward interface has just one function. Enter the start and end times in the box after entering the right YouTube link, then click <strong>“Crop!”</strong> to create a string of links.</p>

Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.</p>
<p>In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you’ll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video’s resolution, let’s look into what a video resolution is!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?</h2><p>A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of <strong>tiny pixels</strong> and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.</p>
<p>Video resolution is rendered in a <strong>vertical</strong> and <strong>horizontal</strong> orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., <strong>480p</strong>, <strong>720p</strong>, <strong>1080p,</strong> etc.</p>
<p>In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a <strong>720p</strong> video is <strong>1280 x 720,</strong> and a <strong>1080p</strong> video is a <strong>1920 x 1080</strong> resolution.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.</p>
<p>Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let’s look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-7-Different-Types-of-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-2-7-Different-Types-of-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution"></a>Part 2. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution</h2><p>It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!</p>
<h3 id="360p"><a href="#360p" class="headerlink" title="360p"></a>360p</h3><p>The full resolution is <strong>480 x 360</strong>. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, <strong>360p</strong> will look blurry. That is why a <strong>360p</strong> resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.</p>
<h3 id="480p"><a href="#480p" class="headerlink" title="480p"></a>480p</h3><p>The full resolution is <strong>853 x 480</strong>. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It’s mainly used in devices such as smaller <strong>TVs</strong>, <strong>laptops,</strong> and <strong>Desktop</strong> computers. It is also available for Burn-in <strong>DVDs</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="720p"><a href="#720p" class="headerlink" title="720p"></a>720p</h3><p>The full version of the resolution is <strong>1280 x 720</strong>. This resolution is called <strong>HD</strong>, short for High Definition. <strong>720p</strong> quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.</p>
<p>Most modern devices, such as <strong>Mobile phones</strong>, <strong>Touch Tablets</strong>, <strong>Laptops,</strong> and <strong>PCs,</strong> are calibrated in <strong>720p</strong> Resolution.</p>

                      alt="wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have added the video clips to the timeline. Instead, it has created a workplace to edit our videos.</p>
<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Exporting a Video to a Specific Device</strong></p>

Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!</p>
<h3 id="360p-1"><a href="#360p-1" class="headerlink" title="360p"></a>360p</h3><p>The full resolution is <strong>480 x 360</strong>. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, <strong>360p</strong> will look blurry. That is why a <strong>360p</strong> resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.</p>
<h3 id="480p-1"><a href="#480p-1" class="headerlink" title="480p"></a>480p</h3><p>The full resolution is <strong>853 x 480</strong>. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It’s mainly used in devices such as smaller <strong>TVs</strong>, <strong>laptops,</strong> and <strong>Desktop</strong> computers. It is also available for Burn-in <strong>DVDs</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="720p-1"><a href="#720p-1" class="headerlink" title="720p"></a>720p</h3><p>The full version of the resolution is <strong>1280 x 720</strong>. This resolution is called <strong>HD</strong>, short for High Definition. <strong>720p</strong> quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.</p>
<p>Most modern devices, such as <strong>Mobile phones</strong>, <strong>Touch Tablets</strong>, <strong>Laptops,</strong> and <strong>PCs,</strong> are calibrated in <strong>720p</strong> Resolution.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our clips imported, it is time to add them to the timeline below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>To add Video clips to the timeline, go through the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Right click to drag and select the <strong>video clips</strong> in the import window.</li>
<li>Release Right-click when in the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-10.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have added the video clips to the timeline. Instead, it has created a workplace to edit our videos.</p>
<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video-1"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-1"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-1" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-2"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-2" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-3"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-3" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

This Article Will Show You How to Use Rule of Thirds to Make a Better Video"></a>Rules of Three or Thirds Is a Classic Trick in Photography, and the Result of Video and Photo Is Really Great. This Article Will Show You How to Use Rule of Thirds to Make a Better Video</h2><p>So you have your work flow sorted out and you’re well on your way with Filmora but you’re not quite happy with your results or something just seems off when you watch your videos back. You may be missing an important element of all visual media and that’s composition. This is where the building blocks of every frame come together to make a visually pleasing piece for the viewer and helps the eyes concentrate on the content rather than trying to figure out what they are looking at.</p>
<p>I’m sure you may have heard of the rule of thirds for art or photography and you may not know or understand what it is. You may even be wondering how the rule of thirds can help you with your video creation. Well, that is what I’m going to show and explain to you today.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#What-is-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="What is the rule of thirds"></a>What is the rule of thirds</h2><p>At its core the rule of thirds is a guide to follow whenever you create something visual.</p>
<p>You break an image into thirds both horizontally and vertically, in doing this you are left with nine boxes and four gridlines, the rule states that by placing key elements in line with gridlines you will have an overall better composition.</p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of this here is a visual example of the gridlines and nine boxes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/rule-of-thirds-gridline.jpg"
                      alt="rule of thirds gridline"
                ></p>
<p>This may seem simple but is often overlooked due to time restraints and eagerness to get that video out there. By following these guidelines your overall composition will gain interesting and pleasing results that can help with viewer engagement. This is only one piece of the puzzle but as any photography professional or artist will tell you, It’s the small things that add up.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-use-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#How-to-use-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="How to use the rule of thirds"></a>How to use the rule of thirds</h2><p>To show how to use the rule of thirds I will be showing an image with and without the use of the guidelines. In doing this you will be able to see how impactful this system is and how it can help with your own creations within <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>This will be our scene example, you can see buildings, boats, water and skyline. This may be typical of a backdrop or an insert for a holiday picture amongst many other things.</p>
<p>I will now show this picture with no compositional thought and without the use of the thirds system.</p>

<p>Notice how all the elements are in the scene but it just looks interesting and something just seems off when you look at it. You may find yourself searching for understanding of the image rather than taking the image in and concentrating on what the creator intended. This is seen commonly due to the need to fit every element in the scene but sometimes it is best to sacrifice something you may see as important for the sake of the whole picture.</p>
<p>We will now look at the example image with the rule of thirds in place and see if overall this makes a more interesting scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/place-thirds-points-in-photo.jpg"
                      alt="place thirds points in photo"
                ></p>
<p>We have aligned the skyline with the first horizontal grid line and aligned the boats with the vertical grid lines. We have sacrificed the crane in the scene but overall I’m sure you can agree that this is more pleasing and makes more sense when you’re viewing this. The whole middle section of the scene now has information within it and the contrast between the middle and the rest of the scene directs your eyes to what was intended to be viewed, This is called effect use of empty space. In doing this you save yourself time from adding more information to direct the viewer.</p>
<p>Placing key elements directly in the center of your scene can seem static and boring but by placing elements to one side or using the first and second horizontal grid lines you create something called Dynamism , where the viewer sees an element along the grid and takes a journey through the rest of the image.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that this is the humans natural way of viewing imagery, we first find something interesting to look at and then journey around that. So by using this rule you are creating a more natural process for your viewer.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-when-starting-using-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#Tips-when-starting-using-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="Tips when starting using the rule of thirds"></a>Tips when starting using the rule of thirds</h2><p>The first tip I would say is to view other videos, YouTube is a good starting point. Watch interviews and notice where the chairs are aligned. Watch reviewers and notice where they position themselves in the scene. Lastly watch movies and pause on an interesting scene and try to deconstruct where everything is placed and why they chose that composition.</p>
<p>The idea with the rule is to have it become something you do naturally, by always considering the form you save yourself time in the editing process. The key things you have in your mind whenever you make a scene should be.</p>
<p>1. What is the key element in my scene or what am I trying to make the viewer focus on.</p>
<p>2. where do I intend to place these in my scene?</p>
<p>3. Have I created a balanced scene with enough negative space to direct the eye.</p>
<p>If you consider this with every video you make then in time this will become as natural as drinking water on a hot day. As a practice you could open some old projects and apply this rule to your video to see the results and you may find yourself impressed with the change.</p>
<p><strong>When is it best to not use the rule of thirds?</strong></p>
<p>The rule is very useful when you’re aiming to grab the attention towards a certain element but that being said, when you have a symmetrical scene you can get away with not using the rule as your eyes can make sense of symmetry very well.</p>
<p>Even when working with a symmetrical scene you can incorporate the rule within for elements such as people or key figures but in this situation it is down to the creator to figure what they feel is best in any given shot.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-Rule-of-Thirds-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-Rule-of-Thirds-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Rule of Thirds in Filmora"></a>How to Use Rule of Thirds in Filmora</h2><p>The tools provided within Filmora are generous and one great feature is the crop and size tool.</p>
<p>When inserting an image or movie file you can right click on the timeline and select crop and size bringing up a handy screen with the gridlines already there for you. It’s just a matter of aligning your shot for the best composition.</p>
<p>For reference I will show you what this looks like.</p>
<p>First right click the timeline on the image you want to reposition. Alternatively you can select the desired insert and press Alt+C this will also bring up the same editing box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop rule of thirds video"
                ></p>
<p>Now click on the crop and zoom option and this editor will appear.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop rule of thirds filmora"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see you are able to align the shot and change the aspect ratio to align with your project. For a better look at the built in grid lines see image below.</p>

                      alt="rule of thirds final video"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, the rule of thirds is very important within visual media and is tough within the fundamentals of art and photography from beginner level right up to the highest point of education, Practice thinking about your placement of key elements within your videos and how this affects your overall composition. The goal is to have this as an automatic thought when shooting your videos or still images. This is a small change you can make but has a big impact on how a viewer engages your content and in return leaves a positive opinion towards your creativity and eye for detail.</p>

Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

You have two options when it comes to making a video. You can either record a video with recording software or you can shoot a video with your camera. Let us discuss both options in detail now.</p>
<p><strong>-Record a video</strong></p>
<p>You can record a video with recording software when you are capturing video from your webcam or from your computer screen. There are two options you have when it comes to choose a recording software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium Recorder - A premium recorder is a professional video recording software that you have to purchase to avail all the features and functionalities. Choose the best video recorder.</li>
<li>Free Recorder - If you are not willing to spend any money on a recording software, there are plenty of free recording applications available. We recommend <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the best free video recorder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-Shoot a video</strong></p>
<p>The second option is shooting a video with your external digital camera. You can also use your phone camera to shoot a video. For example, making vlogs, comedy skits, travel videos, or short films needs a digital camera. If you are using your phone camera, you can cut and crop the video after shooting using the video trimmer apps or online video trimmers. If you are shooting external with an external camera, you can transfer the video to your mobile or computer and use a preferred video trimmer for editing.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>

Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging.

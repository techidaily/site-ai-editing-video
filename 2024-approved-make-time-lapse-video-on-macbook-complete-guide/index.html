A time-lapse video is to create photos at regular intervals and assemble them into the video to record changes that would be slow for the human eye to see. Time-Lapse video shows the technique of slow-motion videos using the same principle.</p>
<p>Time-lapse is usually for several purposes but mostly it is utilized to show the passage of time in a fast-forward format. time-lapse means that the camera takes the picture and then combined them into one video that seems to something happen in quickly. The lapse is set into video form in post-production, so movie mode is not necessary. Once the lapse is finished, it’s time to take it into post-production to bring it to life.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Use-QuickTime-Player-to-Create-Timelapse-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Use-QuickTime-Player-to-Create-Timelapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Use QuickTime Player to Create Timelapse Video"></a>Part 1. Use QuickTime Player to Create Timelapse Video</h2><p>QuickTime player creates a high-resolution video file from the series of photos without having to render the photos twice. The result of QuickTime is a much higher quality result. With this toolkit, after the recording is done, the illusion of fast-moving footage i-e time-lapse is to be created. QuickTime will always ask you what frame rate would you like to video in.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Create Timelapse Video with QuickTime Player:</strong></p>
<p>To produce a timelapse movie using QuickTime Player, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch the Recording</p>
<p>By selecting the File * New Screen Recording option in QuickTime, you may record your screen. After choosing the region to record, your screen will start to be recorded. Real-time video will be captured, and it will be archived.</p>

<p>Step 2: Import the Files</p>
<p>Go to the file &gt; Open Image Sequence menu after starting QuickTime. One of the video files you want to turn into a time-lapse should be opened in QuickTime Player. “Open File.” may be found by clicking the File menu link in the menu bar.</p>
<p>Step 3: Create the Timelapse</p>
<p>Within QuickTime, the series of images will be turned into time-lapse films. Choose one picture from the series, and then change the settings as necessary. Use the Higher Quality Apple Pro Resolution video codec, Actual size resolution, and 25 frames per second.</p>

Create Timelapse Video with iMovie</h2><p>To make an iMovie time-lapse on Mac, you have to capture the video and create a time-lapse out of it. For a multiple-hour recording in a few seconds to be fit, you will need software of time-lapse. Timelapse is utilized for accelerated or slow-motion videos with changes in the frame rate and playback videos in speed. The time-lapse software is available to handle the tasks without sacrificing the quality, size, and format of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Steps To Create Timelapse Video with iMovie</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Launch iMovie</p>
<p>On your Mac, launch the iMovie application, and then import the video clip from the library that you wish to use to create a time-lapse. Drag the video to the timeline. Then you may see additional frames in the timeline by clicking the setting bar below.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="launch imovie"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Import videos and adjust</p>
<p>By clicking the icon that resembles a camera below the Viewer panel, drag images into the project library. Drag the desired images to the Project Library. By choosing File and then selecting Project Properties, you may modify the default settings. Set the first picture location to Fit Frame and the transition length to 1 second.</p>

You may pick “8x” for the default frame rate or “20x” for “Speed” &gt; “Fast.” In iMovie, the minimum time is 0.1 seconds or around 10 frames. As a result, you must first export the time-lapse sequence before speeding up the clip.</p>

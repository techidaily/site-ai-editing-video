The YouTube algorithm determines the videos YouTube recommends to its more than 2 billion human users (and untold numbers of feline users).</p>

                ></p>
<p>The subject of how to encourage YouTube’s algorithm to promote your videos and give you more likes is crucial for marketers, influencers, and creators alike.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss what the algorithm is (and isn’t), the most recent updates for 2022, and how experts use</p>
<p>YouTube’s search and discovery tools to push their videos in front of viewers in this blog post.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-YouTube’s-algorithm’s-history"><a href="#Part-1-YouTube’s-algorithm’s-history" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. YouTube’s algorithm’s history"></a>Part 1. YouTube’s algorithm’s history</h2><p>The YouTube algorithm: What is it? Let’s take a quick look at how YouTube’s algorithm has evolved through time and how it functions now in order to respond to your question.</p>
<p><strong>2005 to 2011: Click-and-view optimization</strong></p>
<p>In order to crowdsource footage of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake’s infamous Superbowl performance, according to YouTube founder Jawed Karim (a.k.a. the star of Me at the Zoo), YouTube was established in 2005. Therefore, it should not be surprising that YouTube’s algorithm for many years displayed suggested videos that had the most views or clicks. Unfortunately, this resulted in an increase in deceptive titles and thumbnails, or clickbait. User experience suffered as a result of videos that made viewers feel duped, dissatisfied, or just plain irritated.</p>
<p><strong>2012: Watch time optimization</strong></p>
<p>YouTube made changes to its recommendation engine in 2012 to account for the amount of time spent watching each video as well as the total amount of time spent on the site. According to theory, when people find videos important and engaging, they watch them for a longer period of time, possibly all the way through. Due to this, some creators tried to make their movies shorter to enhance the likelihood that viewers would watch them through, while others made their videos longer to boost overall viewing time. YouTube maintained the official line—create content your audience wants to watch, and the algorithm will reward you—while refusing to support either of these strategies. However, as anyone who has used the internet for any length of time can attest, not all time spent online is created equal. YouTube has adopted a new strategy.</p>
<p><strong>2015–2016: maximizing fulfillment</strong></p>
<p>In addition to emphasizing direct reaction metrics like Shares, Likes, and Dislikes (and, of course, the extremely cruel “not interested” button), YouTube started monitoring viewer happiness directly using user surveys in 2005. YouTube published a whitepaper titled Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations in 2016 that detailed some of the inner workings of its AI.</p>
<p><strong>2016-present: demonetization, and brand safety</strong></p>
<p>The size and popularity of YouTube have led to an increase in content moderation difficulties over time, and what the algorithm suggests is now a major topic for news outlets and the government in addition to creators and advertisers.</p>
<p>YouTube has stated that it takes seriously its obligation to promote a variety of viewpoints while limiting the spread of damaging false material. For instance, algorithm modifications implemented in the beginning of 2019 have reduced consumption of questionable content by 70%. (According to YouTube, borderline content is that which is harmful or misleading but doesn’t quite go against community standards. On the other hand, offensive material is taken down right away.)</p>
<p>Creators are impacted by this problem because they worry about unintentionally breaking the constantly evolving community rules and getting punished with strikes, demonetization, or worse. (In fact, enhancing openness for community norms for artists is one of YouTube’s priorities for 2021, according to CEO Susan Wojcicki.) Brands and advertisers are also impacted since they don’t want their name and logo to be associated with white nationalists.</p>
<p>Politicians in America are growing more concerned about the societal impact of social media algorithms like YouTube’s. Democrats introduced the “Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act” in early 2021, and YouTube (and other platforms) have been called to testify before Senate committees about their algorithms. Let’s now discuss what is known about this hazardous beast’s mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-will-YouTube’s-algorithm-function-in-2022"><a href="#Part-2-How-will-YouTube’s-algorithm-function-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How will YouTube’s algorithm function in 2022?"></a>Part 2. How will YouTube’s algorithm function in 2022?</h2><p>The YouTube algorithm chooses videos for users with the intention of finding the most relevant content for them and keeping them interested. When we refer to “the algorithm,” we mean one of three selection or discovery techniques that are related but slightly different: three different algorithms: one that chooses videos for YouTube’s main page, one that ranks the results of any given search, and one that chooses what videos users should watch next are used.</p>
<p>According to YouTube, in 2022 the majority of channels’ top traffic sources would often be their homepage and suggested videos. With the exception of explainer or instructional films, which frequently receive the most traffic via search (e.g., “how to tune up a bicycle”)</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-is-the-algorithm-set-up-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-How-is-the-algorithm-set-up-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How is the algorithm set up on YouTube?"></a>Part 3. How is the algorithm set up on YouTube?</h2><p>What ranking factors does YouTube consider when deciding which videos to display to users? Every traffic source varies a little. But in the end, a combination of factors including customization (the history and preferences of the viewer) performance (the success of the video) external variables (the overall audience or market)</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-YouTube-determines-its-homepage-algorithm"><a href="#Part-4-How-YouTube-determines-its-homepage-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How YouTube determines its homepage algorithm"></a>Part 4. How YouTube determines its homepage algorithm</h2><p>The YouTube algorithm presents a wide selection of videos that it thinks a user might like to view every time they open the YouTube app or type in youtube.com. Because the computer hasn’t yet determined what the viewer wants—acoustic versions of popular songs, for example—this selection is frequently broad. talks that are motivating against procrastination? to watch their preferred possum vlogger? Two categories of ranking signals are used to determine which videos appear on the homepage:</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>
<p>YouTube gauges performance using indicators including the click-through rate, typical viewing time, typical percentage of views, likes, and disapproval ratings from viewers. After you upload a video, the algorithm initially displays it to a small number of users on their homepage. If it appeals to, engages, and satisfies those viewers (i.e., they click on it, watch it through, like it, share it, etc.), then it is then presented to an increasing number of users on their homepages.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization:</strong></p>
<p>However, the trending tab does not include YouTube. According to their past activity, also known as their watch history, or personalization, YouTube suggests videos to users based on what it believes are relevant to their interests. More of the same will be presented to a user if they frequently watch a particular channel or show they have an interest in. This element is also responsive to behavioral alterations throughout time as a person’s affinities and interests change.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It’s a fallacy that the algorithm would penalize you for publishing too regularly or insufficiently frequently, even if YouTube undoubtedly promotes the idea of uploading constantly in order to develop and maintain a relationship with your audience. The growth of the audience is unrelated to the interval between uploads. The zeitgeist can change quickly, but by keeping an eye on Google Trends and giving yourself opportunity to explore, you won’t fall behind.</p>

Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography"></a>1. Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography</h3><p>Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).</p>
<p>Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.</p>
<p>The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 &#x3D; RT</p>

Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Launch Filmora video editor on your Windows or Mac computer (I’m running Windows 10 here). Click the New Project in the Startup window to create a new project in 16:9 aspect ratio by default.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Import the video you want to add slow motion effect to the media library, and then drag and drop it to the timeline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To add slow motion effect to part of the video, you need to split the video first and then right click it to choose <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Duration</strong>. There will be a pop-up window. The motion effects will be sped up or slowed down based on the speed values.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When you increase or decrease the video playing speed, the video audio speed changes. If you wish to retain the video audio’s actual playing speed, you may first <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Detach Audio</strong> from the video</a> and then edit the video to achieve a perfect pitch.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: click on the <strong>Choose File</strong> option from the website to upload the video (max. 200MB).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now select the <strong>Speed</strong> of the video from the given options. Since we are going to make a video with slow motion effect, choose 0.5x or 0.8x will work perfectly.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg"
                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg"
                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" change speed  in capcut"
                ></p>
<p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

Video may be recorded with a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of 120 or 240 fps and then played back at a considerably slower rate than usual.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t record video on your iPhone, making slow motion out of videos shot on other cameras or devices is more challenging. The good news is that iMovie for Mac can do this for you. We’ll show you how in this guide.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are easy to make <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using iMovie on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on the <strong>Import Media</strong> option in iMovie once launched on your Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the blue <strong>Import Selected</strong> button once you’ve selected the video file in the file browser to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may now open the movie in iMovie. Creating a <strong>Project</strong> is required at this stage. To do so, click on the Projects option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’ve entered a name for your project, click the blue <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> By dragging the movie onto your timeline, you may modify the video. Select the video by clicking on it and clicking on the <strong>Speed</strong> option to change its speed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: The speed-editing interface will be shown here. Change <strong>Normal to Slow</strong> in the Speed drop-down menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: The duration of your movie will be increased by halves the pace at which it was initially recorded. The video may be slowed down even further by moving the <strong><em>speed slider</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Go to the Menu Bar and choose <strong>File &gt; Share</strong>. Select the file you want to share.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Click the blue <strong>Next</strong> button once you’ve selected the properties you want for the file.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

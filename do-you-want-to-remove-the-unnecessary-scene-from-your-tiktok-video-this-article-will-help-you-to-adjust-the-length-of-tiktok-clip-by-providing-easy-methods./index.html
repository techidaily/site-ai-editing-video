The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video"></a>Part 3. The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video</h2><p>Hope the above part will prove helpful to you in terms of adjusting the TikTok video using Wondershare Filmora. Now, let’s see what the common reasons which hinder users from adjusting the length of TikTok Videos are:</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Video-is-Too-Short"><a href="#1-The-Video-is-Too-Short" class="headerlink" title="1. The Video is Too Short"></a>1. The Video is Too Short</h3><p>Most TikTok users worry about <strong>why they can’t adjust TikTok clip length.</strong> The common reason behind this query is the short length of the video. If your video length is 3 seconds, then it would not be possible to shorten it further on TikTok. Thus, try to make a Video of at least 15 seconds to upload it on TikTok successfully.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Video-is-Too-Long"><a href="#2-The-Video-is-Too-Long" class="headerlink" title="2. The Video is Too Long"></a>2. The Video is Too Long</h3><p>If you have recorded a too-long video, it would not be possible to adjust its length on TikTok. Too long videos, especially more than 10 minutes, are less likely to be modified by TikTok. For that, you can take the help of Filmora to adjust its size. Filmora will trim the video to a suitable length within seconds.</p>

Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects"></a>3. Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects</h3><p>Sometimes people use those effects in videos that are difficult to edit. For example, using a green screen creates some technical issues in your video, which gets weirder when you try to adjust the length of such a video. Due to this, proper adjustments in such videos are difficult to do on TikTok.</p>
<h3 id="4-App-Glitch"><a href="#4-App-Glitch" class="headerlink" title="4. App Glitch"></a>4. App Glitch</h3><p>As many people are engaged in using TikTok, so sometimes the app slows down. It becomes pretty difficult to adjust the length of TikTok videos when the app shows glitches. However, on Filmora, the case is totally the opposite. You will never face any difficulty, no matter how many users are using it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Double-Click on the video in which you added the <strong>effect</strong>.</li>
<li>An editing panel will pop up.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effect</strong> option below the <strong>Video</strong></li>

<h5 id="Step6-Create-Multiple-Outlines"><a href="#Step6-Create-Multiple-Outlines" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Create Multiple Outlines"></a>Step6 Create Multiple Outlines</h5><p>It would help if you created multiple outlines to achieve the Neon Dance effect. These multiple outlines will be produced by exporting them multiple times with the color you want. Follow the below points to get it instantly!</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have selected the color for your outline, export the video by clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>When you have exported the video, move back to the timeline to edit again.</li>
<li>As we had selected the <strong>Blue</strong> color for reference, now choose another color you wish.</li>
<li>After changing the video, export it again.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Export as many times as you want with the color of your choice. <strong>E.g., 5 colors &#x3D; 5 exports.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step7-Import-the-exported-videos"><a href="#Step7-Import-the-exported-videos" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Import the exported videos"></a>Step7 Import the exported videos</h5><ul>
<li>Now you have to import the videos that you exported.</li>
<li>Before doing that, first, delete the video in track 2. (The video on which we applied the <strong>Difference</strong>)</li>
<li>Now select all the exports from your library and import them onto the import window.</li>
<li>Please select all of them and drag them on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don’t want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="offset the videos by a few seconds"
                ></p>
<p>To efficiently blend the outlines with the green screen, you can change the blending mode of each of the exported videos to “<strong>Lighten</strong>.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each video.</li>
<li>In the editing panel, choose compositing.</li>
<li>From there, select the “<strong>Lighten</strong>“ option.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="Step8-Add-the-Glow-effect"><a href="#Step8-Add-the-Glow-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add the Glow effect"></a>Step8 Add the Glow effect</h5><p>To make the outlines glow like Neon lights, we will need to add another effect from the effects library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the effects tab and search for “<strong>Glow</strong>.”</li>
<li>Click and <strong>drag</strong> the glow effect to each of the exported videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>You can make it more fun by going one step further!</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each of the glow effects that you added.</li>
<li>In effect, the <strong>editing panel</strong> goes to the video effects.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the <strong>radius</strong> of the Glow effect you added.</li>
<li>Similarly, you can do it in all the other videos.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect"><a href="#Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Apply the Green screen effect"></a>Step9 Apply the Green screen effect</h5><p>We will change our green screen for the final part. Follow the last steps, and then enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the green screen footage below them all to the top track.</li>
<li>Double-click the video to enter the editing panel.</li>
<li>Go to the chroma key (Green Screen) in the editing panel**.**</li>
<li>Click on the arrow aside from the tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will immediately see changes to your video in the main play window. Play the video from the start and notice the changes.</p>

<li>An editing panel will pop up.</li>

<h5 id="Step6-Create-Multiple-Outlines-1"><a href="#Step6-Create-Multiple-Outlines-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Create Multiple Outlines"></a>Step6 Create Multiple Outlines</h5><p>It would help if you created multiple outlines to achieve the Neon Dance effect. These multiple outlines will be produced by exporting them multiple times with the color you want. Follow the below points to get it instantly!</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have selected the color for your outline, export the video by clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>When you have exported the video, move back to the timeline to edit again.</li>
<li>As we had selected the <strong>Blue</strong> color for reference, now choose another color you wish.</li>
<li>After changing the video, export it again.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Export as many times as you want with the color of your choice. <strong>E.g., 5 colors &#x3D; 5 exports.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step7-Import-the-exported-videos-1"><a href="#Step7-Import-the-exported-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Import the exported videos"></a>Step7 Import the exported videos</h5><ul>
<li>Now you have to import the videos that you exported.</li>
<li>Before doing that, first, delete the video in track 2. (The video on which we applied the <strong>Difference</strong>)</li>
<li>Now select all the exports from your library and import them onto the import window.</li>
<li>Please select all of them and drag them on the timeline.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don’t want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>To efficiently blend the outlines with the green screen, you can change the blending mode of each of the exported videos to “<strong>Lighten</strong>.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each video.</li>
<li>In the editing panel, choose compositing.</li>
<li>From there, select the “<strong>Lighten</strong>“ option.</li>

<h5 id="Step8-Add-the-Glow-effect-1"><a href="#Step8-Add-the-Glow-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add the Glow effect"></a>Step8 Add the Glow effect</h5><p>To make the outlines glow like Neon lights, we will need to add another effect from the effects library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the effects tab and search for “<strong>Glow</strong>.”</li>
<li>Click and <strong>drag</strong> the glow effect to each of the exported videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>You can make it more fun by going one step further!</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each of the glow effects that you added.</li>
<li>In effect, the <strong>editing panel</strong> goes to the video effects.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the <strong>radius</strong> of the Glow effect you added.</li>
<li>Similarly, you can do it in all the other videos.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect-1"><a href="#Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Apply the Green screen effect"></a>Step9 Apply the Green screen effect</h5><p>We will change our green screen for the final part. Follow the last steps, and then enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the green screen footage below them all to the top track.</li>
<li>Double-click the video to enter the editing panel.</li>
<li>Go to the chroma key (Green Screen) in the editing panel**.**</li>
<li>Click on the arrow aside from the tab.</li>

<p>Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Provide Topic</strong></p>
<p>Here you need to provide the topic’s name on which we are planning to create the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>

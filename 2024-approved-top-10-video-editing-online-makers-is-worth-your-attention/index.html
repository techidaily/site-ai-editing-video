<ul>
<li>In the basic tab, as visible above, <strong>Check</strong> the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then <strong>adjust</strong> the element’s position at the wand’s tip on the preview window.</li>

You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand’s tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element’s position onto the wand’s tip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.</p>
<p>Finally, it is time to look at the results. Witness how you have curated a magical masterpiece.</p>

<p>Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. To add an item to your timeline, follow the steps mentioned.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want to add to the timeline.</li>
<li>Keep holding the right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>

These are pre-made presets of different clipart and graphics, executing unique movements and effects. For their introduction in the video, read along with the following procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>After dragging and dropping the clip onto the first track on the timeline, go to the stickers tab on the top left ribbon, click it, and scroll down to the filmstock dropdown.</li>

Once you have successfully added the effect element onto your editing workspace, you have to make it do the magic. Attaching the magic effect bling to the base (background) video is like painting your canvas for the magic to occur. It is a crucial step for bringing out those Harry Potter-like magical feats. Continue scrolling for step-by-step instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the effect element and open the Editing Menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="opening the editing menu"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the basic tab, as visible above, <strong>Check</strong> the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then <strong>adjust</strong> the element’s position at the wand’s tip on the preview window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step6-Detailing-the-Effect-Through-Keyframing-1"><a href="#Step6-Detailing-the-Effect-Through-Keyframing-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Detailing the Effect Through Keyframing"></a>Step6 Detailing the Effect Through Keyframing</h5><p>This part of the procedure is iterative. You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand’s tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element’s position onto the wand’s tip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-13.png"
                      alt="eeadjusting the elements position"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.</p>
<p>Finally, it is time to look at the results. Witness how you have curated a magical masterpiece.</p>

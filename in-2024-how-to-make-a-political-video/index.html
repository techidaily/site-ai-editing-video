<p>A political campaign video is quite similar to other forms of marketing videos. As a political candidate, you are the product, and the cause you’re promoting is your unique selling proposition. A political video helps to promote your cause to the voters. When entering into politics, political campaigns are one of the things you would need to learn how to do. It is the best way to get your message out to the voters. A political video informs the people about who you are, your values, and why you’re the best person to vote for. Your political video needs to be captivating, but more importantly, you need it to be informative and succinctly capture your spirit.</p>
<p>According to an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/us-political-ad-spending-to-hit-record-high/" >eMarketer report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, political ad spending has increased by 63.3%. Political ad spending on TV has increased by 82%. However, political videos go beyond TV as the best videos go viral organically on social media. There are several other video channels where you can also share your video. One thing is clear; political videos aren’t going anywhere, and if you’re exploring this path, you need to learn how to make one. Creating an effective political campaign video is essential, and the next section informs you how you can get it done.</p>
<p><strong>4 Political Campaign Video Ideas to Consider</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of political campaign video ideas. It all depends on your target audience and the cause you’re promoting. This section will provide you with four effective pollical campaign videos you can implement in your next political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-4.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is another idea you can implement for your political video. You can hold a Q&amp;A session on an Instagram story or any other platform that allows you to make a live stream. Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-5.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is an excellent idea for political campaign videos because it allows you to connect with a community better. Videos that focus on a community are an effective method of communicating with the community. You can request community members who support your campaign to feature in your video and share their views. It makes it easier for voters to connect with you because they will relate to their stories. Even better, your viewers might recognize some of the faces you use, promoting loyalty to your cause. Your campaign video will show how it affects everyday lives by engaging a community.</p>
<p>Attack political videos are also quite popular and involve a candidate who speaks negatively of another candidate. However, according to research, it is best to avoid such political videos as they have minimal effect on voter turnout. Additionally, it could backfire and affect you in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>How to Make a Political Campaign Video</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have four ideas you could utilize for your next political video; you’re probably wondering how you can go about it. Follow the steps outlined in this article to make an engaging and excellent political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Set Goals</strong></p>
<p>Before you begin making a political campaign video, you need to set the goals you want to achieve. What is the outcome you want from your video? Do you really want to get your name out there, and just how many people you are hoping to achieve that? Is the goal of the video to raise donations, or do you just want to remind people to vote?</p>
<p>Once you decide what you’re looking to get out of the video, you can now make the best decision regarding content, format, and the metrics you want to measure. You can also set SMART goals that will motivate you to achieve the goals you set for the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Decide Your Target Audience</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the goals you want to achieve, you can then decide who you’re looking to get your video in front of. For example, if your goal is raising money, then you can create a political video that speaks to politically engaged people in your political party.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: What is Your Main Style and Message</strong></p>
<p>With the target audience decided and the goal in mind, create a message in a style you think is compelling and engaging.

<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>
<p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>

Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>

There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>

<p>This article includes tutorials on what to shoot and how to add the Super Jump effect using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The use of tools like masking, time ramping, keyframing, and the new version addition, the Boris FX Pack, makes it super easy to get a perfect super jump effect.</p>
<h2 id="Shots-Required-For-Super-Jump-Effect"><a href="#Shots-Required-For-Super-Jump-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Shots Required For Super Jump Effect"></a>Shots Required For Super Jump Effect</h2><p>You can use either a mobile phone or a camera for shooting, but you have to keep these things in mind:</p>
<p>Keep the following important tips in mind while shooting clips using your phone or camera.</p>
<p><strong>● Use Wide-Angle</strong></p>
<p>Always use the wide-angle view to ensure everything is in focus with a good depth of field.</p>
<p><strong>● The Camera Should Be Steady</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that the phone or camera is on a steady surface to avoid any turbulence or frame shifting.</p>
<p><strong>● Sufficient Light</strong></p>
<p>Make sure there is sufficient light and ambiance. Once you have set your camera, these are the three shots you have to take:</p>
<h3 id="Shot-1-Jump-Into-the-Air-at-a-Distance"><a href="#Shot-1-Jump-Into-the-Air-at-a-Distance" class="headerlink" title="Shot 1: Jump Into the Air at a Distance"></a>Shot 1: Jump Into the Air at a Distance</h3><p>The subject will jump into the air at a distance from the camera. He should jump as high as he can, folding his legs so his body is in a ball position while in the air. The distance should be proper—not very far away.</p>

Here is a step-by-step guide for editing these shots.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Edit-These-Clips"><a href="#Steps-To-Edit-These-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Edit These Clips"></a>Steps To Edit These Clips</h3><p>The tools we are going to use in this editing are masking, time ramping, speed ramping, keyframing, the Boris FX effect, and many more.</p>
<p><strong>Open Wondershare Filmora and Add Video Tracks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Select the empty background clip (shot 3) and place it on the first video track timeline.</p>
<p>Step2 Now place the jumping clip (shot 4) on the top.</p>
<p><strong>Adding a Freeze Frame</strong></p>
<p>A freeze frame is a type of still image that is created by simply freezing the action. Most of the time, this is used in the last shot of a movie to capture a moment in time. Here are the steps to adding a free frame.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Move the playhead up to the point where the subject’s body appears smallest.</p>
<p>Step2 Add a freeze frame at this point by right-clicking on the playhead and selecting the speed option.</p>
<p>Step3 Make a cut at the start of the freeze frame, keep it for 8 frames and delete the rest.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Masking of the Video Clips</strong></p>
<p>Masking is a tool in editing software that allows you to hide, duplicate, show, or adjust footage by selecting a specific section of the video or using video overlays. The steps for adding the masking effect are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Now click on the clip view to open the “settings” window.</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the “mask” section and select the circle mask and create the mask of the jumping subject.</p>
<p>Step3 Hide the first track clip so that mask can be viewed better and edited effectively.</p>
<p>Step4 Adjust the scale, position, and shape of the mask and make the edges smoother to match the object.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="masking"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Boris Fx Effect</strong></p>
<p>Boris FX is a video editing and visual effects software. Filmora supports six continuum units-professional quality effects plugins from award-winning developer Boris FX.</p>
<p>To add these effects to your videos, follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Go to the “effects” window and open the Boris FX effects.</p>
<p>Step2 Select the directional blur from the bcc blur category.</p>
<p>Step3 Drag the effect to the freeze frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now clicking on freeze frame, its settings will open.</p>
<p>Step5 Adjust the degree and angle of blur to get a perfect mask object. Turn ON the first video track.</p>
<p>Step6 Add the landing clip (shot 2) on top of the first video track after the freezing frame.</p>
<p>Step7 Find the point where the subject starts to descend toward the floor. Cut the clip here and delete the previous part.</p>
<p>Step8 Move the clip next to the freeze frame clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/super-jump-effect-6.gif"
                      alt="borax fx effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Keyframing</strong></p>
<p>Now we have to add animation in the freezing frame so that the masked shadow can be shown moving from the back towards the front, a speedy moving shadow. This is probably the most crucial step in editing.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the freezing frame, and in the settings window, open “animation.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the customized option. Add the first keyframe at the start of the clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Now move two frames and add another keyframe with the position of the masked shadow as it is moving out of frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now move two frames keeping the settings the same.</p>
<p>Step5 Add another keyframe at the end with your masked shadow appearing half from the top of the frame.</p>
<p>This step is a bit tricky to understand, but the most important. Once it is done, your animation will give the impression of an object moving like a flash from the back to the front of view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="keyframing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramping</strong></p>
<p>Once the keyframing is done, your super jump effect is roughly ready. All you have to do now is synchronize the speed of jumping, moving shadow, and landing. Here we will use the “speed ramping” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the clip, and in the settings window, choose “speed.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on customize and increase the speed of any frame or clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Move the play head on the frame that you intend to increase the speed of, and move the frame on the speed window to speed up that part.</p>
<p>Once you have done speed ramping on both clips, your editing is done. Now play the video and see how the clip looks and if your super jump effect is remarkable or not.</p>

            <h2 id="How-to-Use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion-Free-LUTs-Resource"><a href="#How-to-Use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion-Free-LUTs-Resource" class="headerlink" title="How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion  &amp; Free LUTs Resource"></a>How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion  &amp; Free LUTs Resource</h2><p>LumaFusion is one of the most complex iPad and iPhone video editing apps. Many of its customers adore it, and it has some incredible capabilities that you’d find incompetent editing software. They’ve effectively opened up the realm of LUTs to iPhone and iPad users.</p>
<p>LumaFusion LUTs are individual files that act as containers in LumaFusion. This container file includes standard LUT data as well as LumaFusion-specific color preset data. A LumaFusion LUT Preset file is similar to a Super LUT. LumaFusion can only employ one standard LUT at a time; however, LumaFusion LUT presets enable simultaneous Color Grading and Color Corrections.</p>
<h2 id="How-will-LUTs-help-with-color-correction-in-Lumafusion"><a href="#How-will-LUTs-help-with-color-correction-in-Lumafusion" class="headerlink" title="How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion"></a>How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion</h2><p>Colors in today’s cameras are vibrant, but they may continuously be improved. Color correction corrects the color that’s already there, whether it’s boosting the exposure to brighten a darker photo or increasing the saturation to make the colors pop. Color correction in other NLEs can be difficult, but not in LumaFusion.</p>
<p>The Color Presets tab in the Color &amp; Effects section is where you begin color correcting footage. There are various presets from which to pick. I wouldn’t use these settings on my videos because they’re too stylized, but they’re there. You may alter any of the presets to your taste, so some of the more dramatic ones can be toned down. By picking the original setting, purists can color-fix their raw footage without using LumaFusion. Moving the sliders till the color seems perfect is all that’s required from there.</p>
<p>Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, mid-tones, and saturation and hue are all controlled by sliders. The color sliders can be used for a more forceful approach. But proceed with caution. The sliders are delicate, and it’s easy to overdo them. Play around with the sliders until you get the look you want. If you don’t like it, toss it in the trashcan and start over.</p>
<p>Color grading and color correction are not interchangeable terms. Color correction is a technical requirement, but color grading is primarily creative. You’ll have no command over the color grading process if you’re working with film material where primary colors aren’t even visible. Before diving into the creative LUTs, make sure you complete adequate color correcting.</p>
<p>Color grading, unlike color correction, adjusts the shot’s color to modify the atmosphere or feel. The only way to do that in LumaFusion is to play around with the color sliders under the Color Presets tab, but that’s not ideal. As previously stated, the three sliders are sensitive and limited. LumaFusion isn’t designed for color grading, which is OK. Thankfully, LumaFusion allows you to use LUTs.</p>
<p>Always color correct your footage before utilizing any LUTS, which entails changing the White-balance, Highlights, Contrast, and Shadows. Do not apply the LUTS to your footage directly.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion"><a href="#How-to-use-LUTs-in-Lumafusion" class="headerlink" title="How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?"></a>How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?</h2><p>Videographers, colorists, and editors use LUTs because they are efficient. Rather than starting from zero every time you work on a video editing project, you may speed up the color grading process using a LUT with predefined color profiles. It’s elementary to import LUTs. Simply import the preset files into LumaFusion and add the preset to your footage like an Instagram filter.</p>
<p>The Import button in the Color &amp; Effects editor is the easiest way to load LUTs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Double click on any video&#x2F;photo clip on the timeline to access the Clip Editors.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the Clip Editor UI, select the Color &amp; Effects tab.</li>
<li>The import button is located directly below the effect preset library.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="How-Long-Does-It-Take-To-Edit-A-Video"><a href="#How-Long-Does-It-Take-To-Edit-A-Video" class="headerlink" title="How Long Does It Take To Edit A Video"></a>How Long Does It Take To Edit A Video</h2><p>If you want to put together the pieces for online videos the number one thing most of the time takes is <strong>editing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too many choices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip.

It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free. Along with this, it is very professional video editing software that people used to create Hollywood movies and that kind of stuff. It provides a very easy and professional interphase that anyone can use without having training.</p>

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free.

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

<li>You can select <strong>slow, fast, normal,</strong> and the most interesting one is <strong>speed ramping.</strong></li>

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos.

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Import the video you want to add slow motion effect to the media library, and then drag and drop it to the timeline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To add slow motion effect to part of the video, you need to split the video first and then right click it to choose <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Duration</strong>. There will be a pop-up window. The motion effects will be sped up or slowed down based on the speed values.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When you increase or decrease the video playing speed, the video audio speed changes.

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

Video may be recorded with a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of 120 or 240 fps and then played back at a considerably slower rate than usual.</p>
<p>However, if you don’t record video on your iPhone, making slow motion out of videos shot on other cameras or devices is more challenging. The good news is that iMovie for Mac can do this for you. We’ll show you how in this guide.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are easy to make <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >using iMovie on your Mac <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Just follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on the <strong>Import Media</strong> option in iMovie once launched on your Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the blue <strong>Import Selected</strong> button once you’ve selected the video file in the file browser to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may now open the movie in iMovie. Creating a <strong>Project</strong> is required at this stage. To do so, click on the Projects option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’ve entered a name for your project, click the blue <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> By dragging the movie onto your timeline, you may modify the video. Select the video by clicking on it and clicking on the <strong>Speed</strong> option to change its speed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: The speed-editing interface will be shown here. Change <strong>Normal to Slow</strong> in the Speed drop-down menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: The duration of your movie will be increased by halves the pace at which it was initially recorded. The video may be slowed down even further by moving the <strong><em>speed slider</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Go to the Menu Bar and choose <strong>File &gt; Share</strong>. Select the file you want to share.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Click the blue <strong>Next</strong> button once you’ve selected the properties you want for the file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Select a name for the file, store it, and then click the blue <strong>Save</strong> button to save it to your computer.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To add slow motion effect to part of the video, you need to split the video first and then right click it to choose <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Duration</strong>. There will be a pop-up window. The motion effects will be sped up or slowed down based on the speed values.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg"
                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.</p>

                      alt="filmora startup window"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Import the video you want to add slow motion effect to the media library, and then drag and drop it to the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To add slow motion effect to part of the video, you need to split the video first and then right click it to choose <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Duration</strong>. There will be a pop-up window. The motion effects will be sped up or slowed down based on the speed values.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When you increase or decrease the video playing speed, the video audio speed changes. If you wish to retain the video audio’s actual playing speed, you may first <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Detach Audio</strong> from the video</a> and then edit the video to achieve a perfect pitch.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Select <strong>Expor</strong>t after you’ve completed setting the video speed. By selecting <strong>Format</strong>, you may save the video in any significant format.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: click on the <strong>Choose File</strong> option from the website to upload the video (max. 200MB).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now select the <strong>Speed</strong> of the video from the given options. Since we are going to make a video with slow motion effect, choose 0.5x or 0.8x will work perfectly.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-capcut.jpg"
                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg"
                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-capcut-normal.jpg"
                      alt=" change speed  in capcut"
                ></p>
<p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.</p>

You can make commercials, animated movies etc. Here are some questions from which you will get to know everything you need to know:</p>
<h3 id="01What-is-an-Online-Storyboard"><a href="#01What-is-an-Online-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="01What is an Online Storyboard?"></a>01What is an Online Storyboard?</h3><p>Online Storyboard allows you to create animation videos or films on a web based platform, which is credible in the sense that you do not need to be device specific to use the tool. A web based storyboard works in all your preferred devices and smart phones. The tool does not require a download or installation; however the tool requires a sign up for working on the platform.</p>
<h3 id="02What-are-the-components-of-a-storyboard"><a href="#02What-are-the-components-of-a-storyboard" class="headerlink" title="02What are the components of a storyboard?"></a>02What are the components of a storyboard?</h3><p>Every shot of the storyboard captures different components. Here are some main components:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Learning purpose</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A detailed description of communication</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Informatory Strategies to teach the learners</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Format should be perfect according to the topic</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Proper information of audio with file names</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Feedback for the assessment</p>
<h3 id="03Why-do-you-need-a-Storyboard"><a href="#03Why-do-you-need-a-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="03Why do you need a Storyboard?"></a>03Why do you need a Storyboard?</h3><p>A Storyboard is a process of pre- production. It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p>
<h3 id="04How-to-Label-Storyboards"><a href="#04How-to-Label-Storyboards" class="headerlink" title="04How to Label Storyboards?"></a>04How to Label Storyboards?</h3><p>If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p>
<p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them “OTS 1” and “OTS 2” with the corresponding dialogues.</p>

It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p>

If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p>
<p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-1"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-1" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene.

It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p>

If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p>
<p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-2"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-2" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene.

It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p>

If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p>
<p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-3"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-3" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene.

                      alt="fake-facetime-call-video-"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: You can now find your videos in your media library. Drag and drop the picture-in-picture videos you want to alter to the editing timeline. As shown in the sample below, arrange the two videos one over the other. Make sure both clips are precisely underneath one another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fake-facetime-call-video-"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Now that your movies are aligned, select the one you want to shrink. The video you’re reducing must be at the top of the screen. To move it from the bottom to the top, drag and drop it. A small box will appear on the timeline in the bottom left corner of the clip. The clip will shrink when you click the box once. When you click the box once again, modifying choices will appear. You can move the smaller video around and increase or decrease its size.</p>

A small box will appear on the timeline in the bottom left corner of the clip. The clip will shrink when you click the box once. When you click the box once again, modifying choices will appear. You can move the smaller video around and increase or decrease its size.</p>

<p>Step 2: Click the ‘Create a video’ button on the left sidebar. There are five different forms from which to pick. First, choose the video aspect ratio that works best for your project. For example, if you wish to upload to YouTube, we recommend shooting in widescreen 16:9.</p>

<p>Step 4: You can now find your videos in your media library. Drag and drop the picture-in-picture videos you want to alter to the editing timeline. As shown in the sample below, arrange the two videos one over the other. Make sure both clips are precisely underneath one another.</p>

<p>Step 5: Now that your movies are aligned, select the one you want to shrink. The video you’re reducing must be at the top of the screen. To move it from the bottom to the top, drag and drop it. A small box will appear on the timeline in the bottom left corner of the clip. The clip will shrink when you click the box once. When you click the box once again, modifying choices will appear. You can move the smaller video around and increase or decrease its size.</p>

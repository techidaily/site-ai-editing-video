You may need to add texts in the intro and outro of the video as well as to highlight important parts in the middle of the video. Showing regular and static texts and titles is very unappealing, and that is why everyone includes font effects to animate the texts.</p>
<p>There are different types of font effects available to apply to the texts and titles in your video. There are premium video editors available with a wide range of effects such as After Effect font effects. If you are an occasional video creator, you can use online font effects while you edit your videos on the go. We will illustrate how to add font effects to videos on any device.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"
                      alt="start new project"
                ></p>
<p>Step3Import your video file from your hard drive by going to File&gt; Import Media&gt; Import Media Files from the menu bar. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the video file into Project Media folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-03.png"
                      alt="import media file "
                ></p>
<p>Step4Drag and drop the video file into the Timeline. You can add multiple video clips. Thereafter, you can arrange them in proper order on the Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="arrange the video file"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Go to Titles located at the top bar. From the left panel, select any category of text effect and drop into the Timeline on top of the video clip. You should place the text effect on the Timeline wherever you want it to appear in the video. You can also stretch the duration of the text effect as per your preference.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="duration of the text effect"
                ></p>

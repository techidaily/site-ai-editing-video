Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their <strong>brand storytelling</strong>. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray <strong>your brand story</strong> than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.</p>
<p>Modern-day consumers are much more educated and sophisticated than before. You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their <strong>branding and storytelling</strong> strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own <strong>brand storytelling video</strong> and are wondering how to make it a successful one.</p>
<p>Take no worries as the further sections will clear all your doubts and give you the perfect answer. So, let’s start.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Keep a good balance between the text and the images so that it does not look weird.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The color and the font of the text are among the most important factors to be considered. Make sure that both the text color as well as the font match and blend well with the theme and the images in the collage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keeping the background of the text simple, less detailed, and also clutter-free is important so that the text content comes out nicely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure only to add a few words or lines in your collage to make it look sophisticated. It’s majorly a photo collage with a dash of the text so keep it that way only and not vice-versa.</p>

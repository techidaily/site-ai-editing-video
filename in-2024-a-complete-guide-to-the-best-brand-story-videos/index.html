Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.</p>
<p>However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their <strong>brand storytelling</strong>. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray <strong>your brand story</strong> than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.</p>
<p>Modern-day consumers are much more educated and sophisticated than before. You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their <strong>branding and storytelling</strong> strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own <strong>brand storytelling video</strong> and are wondering how to make it a successful one.</p>
<p>Take no worries as the further sections will clear all your doubts and give you the perfect answer. So, let’s start.</p>

The Most Successful Video Practises of Brand Storytelling</h2><h3 id="1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You"><a href="#1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You" class="headerlink" title="1. Spotify - All Ears On You"></a>1. Spotify - All Ears On You</h3><p>Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.</p>
<p>One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get the Most Out of Big Data:</strong> The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage User-Generated Content:</strong> Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize The Trending Hashtags &amp;</strong> <strong>Topics</strong>: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms</li>
<li>Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Airbnb-The-Story-of-a-Symbol-of-Belonging"><a href="#2-Airbnb-The-Story-of-a-Symbol-of-Belonging" class="headerlink" title="2. Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging"></a>2. Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging</h3><p>The center of focus of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU" >Airbnb’s brand story <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> revolves around the basic ideology of ‘belonging.’ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can ‘belong anywhere.’</p>
<p>Their official tagline also turned out to be ‘Belong Anywhere,’ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure it’s instantly recognizable.</p>
<p><strong>Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization</strong>: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.</li>
<li><strong>It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story</strong>: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.</li>
<li><strong>Content Is The King:</strong> Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-Apple-Chase"><a href="#3-Apple-Chase" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple - Chase"></a>3. Apple - Chase</h3><p>Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.</p>
<p>They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk" >iPhone 14 pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.</p>
<p>Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.</p>
<h3 id="4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos"><a href="#4-Nike-Most-Powerful-Brand-Story-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos"></a>4. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos</h3><p>If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dIAMe1sQno" >LeBron James <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They don’t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.</p>

<h3 id="1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You-1"><a href="#1-Spotify-All-Ears-On-You-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Spotify - All Ears On You"></a>1. Spotify - All Ears On You</h3><p>Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.</p>
<p>One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.</p>
<p><strong>Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get the Most Out of Big Data:</strong> The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage User-Generated Content:</strong> Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Utilize The Trending Hashtags &amp;</strong> <strong>Topics</strong>: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.</li>

<p><strong>Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization</strong>: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users.

<li><strong>It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story</strong>: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.</li>
<li><strong>Content Is The King:</strong> Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.</li>

<p>I have shown you the six best online mp4 croppers and each of its pros and cons. By now, you have an idea of which of these would suit you as a user.</p>
<p>The question is… are you aware of what you need or want for a mp4 video cropper? It’s time for you to weigh your own values and which mp4 cropper would fit that. Yes, you can read tons of reviews on the internet but if you don’t have self- awareness then you would still be confused on which would fit you.</p>
<p>There is no need to fear the unknown. A part of the process is exploring the possibilities and here we are demonstrating to you your 6 best choices to try from.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments about your thoughts on these tools. You could also make your own pros and cons of these mp4 video croppers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>
<li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li>
<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>

This is where the <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editing feature comes into play. You can stabilize a video with the Google Photos app that has a built-in video stabilizer and other editing tools to give a finishing touch to your media files before they are shared online or with family, friends, and&#x2F;or colleagues.</p>
<p>In this article, we will show you how to use Google Photos as a <strong>stabilizer video Google</strong> offers to its consumer. In addition, you will also learn about one of the most trusted and efficient third-party tools to stabilize the clips if <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> fails to produce quality output.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?</a></p>

<p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos Online?</a></p>
<p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Use Google Photos to Edit Video?</a></p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Google-Photos-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Google-Photos-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.</p>
<p>The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if&#x2F;when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p>
<p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p>
<p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Stabilize-Videos-with-Google-Photos-on-Android-and-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Stabilize-Videos-with-Google-Photos-on-Android-and-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?"></a>Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?</h2><p>Google Photos is available for both Android and iPhone smartphones, and as explained earlier, the app can be downloaded from Play Store and App Store respectively. Using the built-in <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.</p>
<p>You can learn how to work with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos</strong></p>
<p>Download and install Google Photos on your smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations). Launch the app, tap <strong>Library</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the interface, and tap to open the source video that you want to stabilize with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Stabilize the Video</strong></p>
<p>After the video opens in the app and the playback begins, tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the bottom. On the next screen, ensure that the <strong>Video</strong> section is selected. Tap the <strong>Stabilize</strong> icon from the lower-left area of the window, and wait while <strong>Google Photos stabilize video</strong>.</p>

<p>The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if&#x2F;when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p>
<p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p>
<p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p>

<p>The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if&#x2F;when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p>
<p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p>
<p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p>

Some post-production tasks that you can perform while using Google Photos include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Trimming</strong></p>
<p>The trimming handles can be seen when you are on the ‘Video’ section after tapping ‘Edit’ in Google Photos after opening the video. You can drag these handles inwards to get rid of the unwanted starting and ending parts of a clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-trim-video.jpg"
                      alt="google photos trim video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>2. Cropping</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Crop’ section enables you to crop the videos in a particular aspect ratio that can be selected from the available list, or drag the handles manually to get custom results.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-crop-video.jpg"
                      alt="google photos crop video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>3. Rotating</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Crop’ section also has an option to rotate the video. Each time you tap the ‘Rotate’ icon, the screen rotates 90o in the counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate video google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>4. Color Correction</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Adjust’ section allows you to adjust the display of a video such as its brightness, contrast, shadows, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video color correction google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>5. Filters</strong></p>
<p>You can even add a filter using the presets available in the ‘Filters’ section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filters-google-photos.jpg"
                      alt="filters google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>6. Annotations</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Markup’ section enables you to annotate the video. You can either use the ‘Pen’ tool or ‘Highlighter’ to write text on the video or give the screen a different shade respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-markup-google-photos.jpg"
                      alt="video markup google photos"
                ></p>
<p>Depending on the type of modifications you want in your video, you can use Google Photos to get the job done easily and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Google video stabilizer is a built-in tool in Google Photos. Google Photos can be obtained from Play Store or App Store for your Android or iOS smart devices respectively. In addition to stabilizing your videos, Google Photos app also enables you to make other modifications such as trimming, cropping, applying filters, and much more.</p>

Amidst this, videos have become a powerful medium to relive the past. If you’re aiming to infuse your videos with a touch of the ‘90s, look no further than the VHS effect.</p>
<p>For those who need a quick trip down memory lane, VHS tapes were once the cornerstone of home entertainment. These clunky plastic cassettes captured countless memories, from family gatherings to favorite films and TV shows. While they might be alien to newer generations, they hold a special place in the chronicles of video evolution.</p>
<p>The VHS effect isn’t just about mimicking the look of these tapes. It’s about encapsulating their essence—grainy visuals, occasional jitters, and that characteristic static. Incorporating these imperfections into today’s high-definition videos imparts a distinctive vintage flair. It’s akin to applying an Instagram filter to a photo, where a simple touch can transport a viewer back in time. Dive in as we guide you on adding this retro charm to your free videos.</p>

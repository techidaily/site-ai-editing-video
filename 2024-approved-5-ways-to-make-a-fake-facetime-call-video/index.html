<p>5 ways to make a fake facetime call video</p>
<h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora"></a>1. Filmora</h3><p>Compatibility: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the greatest video editor on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p>
<p>You’ll discover some professional tools to help you improve video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort with the Filmora video editor. This tool is one of the most dependable, aside from the features that allow you to modify video rotation easily.</p>
<h4 id="Steps"><a href="#Steps" class="headerlink" title="Steps"></a>Steps</h4><p><strong>Step 1: Import the photo or video files</strong></p>
<p>Import all your media files, including video, photos, and music. You have two options for importing your videos: drag and drop directly into our software or click import to select the media files you wish to upload.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fake-facetime-call-video-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Edit the video</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora’s video templates can be added. You can apply music, text, filters and overlays, and motion effects by right-clicking on them and selecting apply. After adding video resources such as text and elements, you may customize the texts by changing the size, placement, etc.</p>
<p>Also, you can add overlay video clips using templates of a video call to make it look like a real call.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="Step-3-Export-and-Save"><a href="#Step-3-Export-and-Save" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Export and Save"></a>Step 3: Export and Save</h4><p>Quickly export your project to a new video. After you’ve applied the video resources to your videos and clicked Export, you’ll have a whole new video that you can share at birthday parties, weddings, or for marketing purposes, just like any other video you’ve created.</p>

<h3 id="4-Clipchamp"><a href="#4-Clipchamp" class="headerlink" title="4. Clipchamp"></a>4. Clipchamp</h3><p>Compatibility: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>
<p>Clipchamp is a free online video editor that makes movie creation simple for anyone, even if they have no prior editing knowledge. It lets you blend films, photos, and audio files and add text and effects before saving the finished product to your computer.</p>
<h4 id="Steps-3"><a href="#Steps-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps"></a>Steps</h4><p>Step 1: To get started, log into your Clipchamp account or create a free account.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-12.jpg"
                      alt="fake-facetime-call-video-"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Click the ‘Create a video’ button on the left sidebar. There are five different forms from which to pick. First, choose the video aspect ratio that works best for your project. For example, if you wish to upload to YouTube, we recommend shooting in widescreen 16:9.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-13.jpg"
                      alt="fake-facetime-call-video-"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Click ‘Add media’ and drag and drop your films, audio, and photographs into the media box if you already have filmed footage you’d like to utilize in your project. You may also add media by clicking ‘Browse my files.’ If you wish to use free stock footage, go to ‘Stock’ and upload your films to the project by clicking the ‘+’ button. All your films will be saved in your library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-14.jpg"
                      alt="fake-facetime-call-video-"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: You can now find your videos in your media library. Drag and drop the picture-in-picture videos you want to alter to the editing timeline. As shown in the sample below, arrange the two videos one over the other. Make sure both clips are precisely underneath one another.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-15.jpg"
                      alt="fake-facetime-call-video-"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Now that your movies are aligned, select the one you want to shrink. The video you’re reducing must be at the top of the screen. To move it from the bottom to the top, drag and drop it. A small box will appear on the timeline in the bottom left corner of the clip. The clip will shrink when you click the box once. When you click the box once again, modifying choices will appear. You can move the smaller video around and increase or decrease its size.</p>

<p>Step 4: You can now find your videos in your media library. Drag and drop the picture-in-picture videos you want to alter to the editing timeline. As shown in the sample below, arrange the two videos one over the other. Make sure both clips are precisely underneath one another.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Now that your movies are aligned, select the one you want to shrink. The video you’re reducing must be at the top of the screen. To move it from the bottom to the top, drag and drop it. A small box will appear on the timeline in the bottom left corner of the clip. The clip will shrink when you click the box once. When you click the box once again, modifying choices will appear. You can move the smaller video around and increase or decrease its size.</p>

<p>Masking video editing is the process of hiding or obscuring certain elements in a video clip. This can be done for aesthetic purposes and is often used to remove unwanted objects or blemishes from the footage. Masking can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-Masking-2"><a href="#What-is-Masking-2" class="headerlink" title="What is Masking?"></a>What is Masking?</h2><p>Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage. The mask is the portion of the video you’ve chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.</p>
<p>Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!</p>
<h3 id="Different-types-of-masking-2"><a href="#Different-types-of-masking-2" class="headerlink" title="Different types of masking"></a>Different types of masking</h3><p>There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>
<p>Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.</p>
<p>Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.</p>
<p>Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.</p>

<p>Masking video editing is the process of hiding or obscuring certain elements in a video clip.

The mask is the portion of the video you’ve chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.</p>
<p>Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional.

<h3 id="Different-types-of-masking-3"><a href="#Different-types-of-masking-3" class="headerlink" title="Different types of masking"></a>Different types of masking</h3><p>There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>
<p>Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.</p>
<p>Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.</p>
<p>Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.</p>

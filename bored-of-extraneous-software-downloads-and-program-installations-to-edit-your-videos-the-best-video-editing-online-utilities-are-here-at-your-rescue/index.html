<h3 id="New-Features-1"><a href="#New-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="New Features"></a>New Features</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Separates the Object:</strong> RSMB Pro has the additional capability to isolate the background and foreground effectively. It utilizes a specified matte that can help in object separation to create motion blur with great precision. (Not available with Movie Studio, Vegas Pro, Catalyst Edit, Smoke, Media Composer, Flame, or Nucoda)</li>
<li><strong>Blur with Motion Vectors:</strong> If you have imported a 3D animation video, the pro version can blur the motion vectors provided by you. Thus, it can work on a 3D animation system perfectly. (Not available with Vegas Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Movie Studio, Media Composer, Catalyst Edit, or Nucoda)</li>
<li><strong>RGB+A Tracking:</strong> This option is used to recognize and track dark images with mattes by using the alpha channel. You can use this option for masked or CG stuff. (Not available with Media Composer)</li>
<li><strong>Use of Tracking Points:</strong> To help the RSMB’s calculation of motion vectors, you can provide tracking points. By defining the tracking points, you can tell RSMB about the movement of one pixel from one frame to another efficiently. (Not available with Vegas Pro, Media Composer, Catalyst Edit, DaVinci Resolve, Smoke, Flame, Movie Studio, or Nucoda)</li>
<li><strong>Spline Guidance:</strong> If RSMB encounters problems related to tracking, you can draw and animate shapes to tell about the object’s movement. Thus, it can help the RSMB find the object movement easily. (Not available with Premiere Pro, Nucoda, Vegas Pro, HitFilm, Movie Studio, Smoke, Sihouette, Flame, Scratch, Nuke, Motion, Media Composer, DaVinci Resolve, Catalyst Edit, FCPX)</li>

This polished effect can make your video’s title stand out and is one of the best ways to create a stunning title for YouTube and Instagram clips. In this article, we will be looking at how to create the gold text using After Effects.</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-Create-Gold-Text-Effects-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Steps-to-Create-Gold-Text-Effects-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects"></a>Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects</h2><p>Follow these steps to create a gold text effect in your After Effects video project;</p>
<p>Step1Start by creating an environment. To do that just right-click and choose “New Comp” and click “OK” to create one.</p>
<p>Step2Then we need to add fractal noise. To do that, click on “Effects and Presets” and type in “fractal” to choose “Fractal Noise.” You can double-click on it or drag it to the comp.</p>
<p>Step3Once this is done, you will need to do a little bit of housekeeping on the contrast and brightness. Increase the “Contrast” and reduce the “Brightness.”</p>
<p>Then go to the “Sub Settings” and reduce the “Sub Influence” down to zero.</p>
<p>Go to “Transform Option” and decrease the scale just a little bit. Then increase the “Scale Height” just a little.</p>
<p>Step4The next step is to add color to the scene. To do that, right-click on the layer and choose “New &gt; Solid.” Select the gold color and click “OK.” Do the same with the second layer.</p>
<p>Step5Now you want to blend both colors by choosing a blending mode. Hold the “Shift” key and “hyphen” or “&#x3D;” sign on the keyboard and choose “Overlay.”</p>
<p>Step6To make the color stronger, go to “Layer &gt; Solid Settings” and choose a color.</p>
<p>Step7Go back to “Comp 3.” Right-click on it and select “New &gt; Light” to add a new point of light.</p>
<p>Step8Go back to the project panel to click on “Comp 4” to add the environment. Right-click on the Comp 4 layer and make it an environment layer.</p>
<p>Step9In the options that appear, set “Appears in Reflections” to “Only” and you can then increase and decrease the color saturation until you have the desired result.</p>

<p>To do that, go click on the “Titles” tab at the top and drag one of the default titles to the timeline.</p>
<p>Once it is in the timeline, double-click on the title and edit it. Type in anything you want to appear in the title.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.</p>
<p>Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.</p>
<p>Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.</p>
<p>Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:</p>
<p>- Scale the video up or down</p>

<p>There are two main ways to rotate video in Filmora: through the use of keyframes or by using the Transform Tool.</p>
<h3 id="Step-by-step-on-how-to-rotate-videos-in-Filmora-2"><a href="#Step-by-step-on-how-to-rotate-videos-in-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Step-by-step on how to rotate videos in Filmora"></a>Step-by-step on how to rotate videos in Filmora</h3><p>To rotate a video clip using keyframes…</p>
<p>Step 1: Import the video clip you want to rotate to your project.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: In the timeline, place the playhead at the beginning of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: With the playhead still at the beginning of the clip, drag the rotation handle in the preview window to rotate the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-9.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Move the playhead to the end of the clip and drag the rotation handle again to rotate it further.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-10.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>To rotate a video clip using the Transform Tool…</p>
<p>Select the “Edit” tool from the toolbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-11.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Go to the “Transform” selection, then select the rotate option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-12.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Adjust the rotation angle using the tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-13.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Both methods are fairly straightforward and easy to use. Experiment with each to see which works best for your project.</p>
<p>Step 2: Then, click on the “Strip” menu and select “Transform.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: In the Transform Properties window, you will see a list of different tools for the video. Scroll down until you see the “Rotation” property. This is where you can manually rotate the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-3.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Click on Enter to save the rotation of the video.</p>
<p>The second way to rotate a video in Blender is by using the Transform Properties window. To do this…</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the video that you want to rotate in Blender.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-4.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Next, go to ‘Transform’ in the Active Tool portion of the screen.</p>
<p> Figure 5</p>
<p>Step 3: Go to the ‘Transform’ option in the properties window and adjust based on the rotational angle that you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-6.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Click on ‘Enter’ to apply it to the video.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.</p>
<p>Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.</p>
<p>Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.</p>
<p>Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:</p>
<p>- Scale the video up or down</p>
<p>- Flip the video horizontally or vertically</p>
<p>- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport</p>

<p>If you’re just starting out, it might be a good idea to stick to a more traditional style of videography. This will help you get the hang of things and build your skills before trying something more adventurous.

Understand your videography style and skill level</h3><p>Wedding videography can be done in a variety of styles, depending on your skill level and interests. Some videographers prefer to stay in the background and capture everything as it happens, while others like to get more involved, interviewing the couple and capturing special moments. It’s important to understand what style you feel comfortable working in, and what the couple is looking for in a video.</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out, it might be a good idea to stick to a more traditional style of videography. This will help you get the hang of things and build your skills before trying something more adventurous.

<h3 id="10Neo-Tokyo-3"><a href="#10Neo-Tokyo-3" class="headerlink" title="10Neo-Tokyo"></a>10Neo-Tokyo</h3><p><strong>Major Attractions</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Compiling 3 short stories into a single movie, this one is an experiment of brilliance in the anime world</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The engaging storylines of each of the 3 shorts will never let you have enough of the movie with a desire to stream one more time</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The directors aim to tell the stories in an animated poetic style that suits the theme of the plot.</p>
<p>Introduced to the anime cinema in 1987, Neo-Tokyo was initially addressed as Manie Manie: Labyrinth Tales. The movie is a split-up craft of the biggest names in the anime world and features shots directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Katsuhiro Otomo and Rintaro. The film got its existing name during its re-release in 1989 by Streamline Pictures to avoid a title clash with Otomo’s allied production Akira, that had hit the screens in the same year.</p>
<p>Viewing through the specific shorts in particular, the ‘Labyrinth Labyrinthos’ directed by Rintaro is inspired by German Expressionism in cohesion with the craft of Salvador Dali. The plot follows Sachi, a notorious young girl who, via the dresser’s looking glass, gets drawn into the gloomy space of a hallucinating quirkiness, along with Cicerone, her pet kitten.</p>
<p>As of ‘The Running Man’ directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the latter is an ugly science fiction noir short that draws its inspiration from Blade Runner. The storyteller here is a sports correspondent who gets the privilege to see Jack Hugh’s last race. This legendary sports star of a dangerous running tournament was then reported to have imbibed fatal psionic tendencies.</p>
<p>Reserving the best for the last, here enters ‘Construction Cancellation Order’, the last short directed by Katsuhiro Omoto. The story progresses with the journey of Tsutomu Sugioka, who is sent to a fictitious and remote area in Aloana Republic, a city in South America by his seniors. His job is to shut down Facility 444, a remote construction project of his Japanese company.</p>
<p>Put collectively, Neo-Tokyo is a masterpiece of technical excellence that showcases the bright future of amine movies, provided that they are crafted by the most unique film creators of the anime world.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Comments</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a fantastic and cohesive alignment of 3 non-connected stories in one frame to represent an integration that is nothing short of magic</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a gorgeous play of twisted blocks and designs that conveniently takes the shape of a really great anthology flick</p>

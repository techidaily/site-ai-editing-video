<p><strong>What you need to prepare:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A computer (Windows or macOS)</li>

</ul>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Step 1</p>
<p>Go ahead and download the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before all else. The program will install and start automatically. Just hit “Download” and then “Install”.</p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>Once the program starts, open a New Project. Then, go to “<strong>Sample Color</strong>” and drag any color you want to the Timeline.</p>

                      alt="sample color filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Now, head over to the “<strong>Titles</strong>” tab and drag the Basic Title to the Timeline. Place it above the Sample Color clip.</p>

                      alt="basic title in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Right-click on the Title clip in the Timeline and select <strong>Edit Properties</strong> from the menu. From there, click on “ADVANCED” to open the advanced settings. Here, you can change the font, adjust the text size, and place your titles wherever you want on the screen.</p>

Wondershare Filmora Will Fill the Crazy Colors in Your Handwritten Note or Words"></a>You Can Make Stylish Chroma Key Text Effects After Reading This Article. Wondershare Filmora Will Fill the Crazy Colors in Your Handwritten Note or Words</h2><p>Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Chroma-Key-Text-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Chroma-Key-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?"></a>Part 1. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?</h2><p>Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png"
                      alt="chroma key text effect"
                ></p>
<p>Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it’s an easy way to make 3D motion videos.</p>
<p>To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Filming-Tips-for-Written-Texts"><a href="#Part-2-Filming-Tips-for-Written-Texts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Filming Tips for Written Texts"></a>Part 2. Filming Tips for Written Texts</h2><p>To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-1-A-Pen-and-a-White-Paper"><a href="#Tip-1-A-Pen-and-a-White-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. A Pen and a White Paper"></a>Tip 1. A Pen and a White Paper</h3><p>We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.</p>
<p>We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png"
                      alt="purple color pen on white paper"
                ></p>
<p>It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it’s more apparent during filming.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-2-Different-Color-Paper"><a href="#Tip-2-Different-Color-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Different Color Paper"></a>Tip 2. Different Color Paper</h3><p>There are many chances that you don’t have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don’t need to worry because you can use different color papers too.</p>
<p>But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png"
                      alt="different color paper with different markers"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don’t use dull color pens with bright color paper.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-3-Camera-Angles"><a href="#Tip-3-Camera-Angles" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Camera Angles"></a>Tip 3. Camera Angles</h3><p>While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the writer’s hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png"
                      alt="don&#39;t block the letters from the left side"
                ></p>
<p>After checking the alignment of the camera, it’s time to look at what size we have to use for writing!</p>
<h3 id="Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters"><a href="#Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters"></a>Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters</h3><p>As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.</p>
<p>It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-5.png"
                      alt="the larger size of the written key text"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.</p>
<p>After filming all the clips, you must edit those shots on the Filmora to get the chroma effect. Scroll more to get the step-by-step process!</p>

<h3 id="Tip-3-Camera-Angles-1"><a href="#Tip-3-Camera-Angles-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Camera Angles"></a>Tip 3. Camera Angles</h3><p>While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the writer’s hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After checking the alignment of the camera, it’s time to look at what size we have to use for writing!</p>
<h3 id="Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters"></a>Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters</h3><p>As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.</p>
<p>It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.</p>

<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>These steps will help you to know how to edit video with Filmora software;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start a new project.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png"
                      alt="filmora start new project"
                ></p>
<p>After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import your media</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"
                      alt="filmora import media"
                ></p>
<p>The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the <em>‘File &gt; Import Media Folder’</em> menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.</p>
<p>After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.</p>
<p>These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add clips to the timeline, trim, adjust appropriately and sequence them.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filmora split video"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.</p>
<p>Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.</p>
<p>After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.</p>

<p>When working on your video footage, click the spacebar of your computer keyboard to preview. By doing this, you will be able to see how your clips are joined together.</p>
<p>Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Click on the Effect icon at the top of the app and a deep visual library of effects will be visible. If you want to add a certain effect to your active clip, just double-click it.</p>
<p>Add transitions in your video timeline to cut the scene-to-scene. They are quite necessary as they help establish your audience’s attention.</p>
<p>The next thing after adding the transmissions will be adding the overlays and exporting your video by clicking on the ‘<em>Export</em>‘ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Export your finished video.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>

<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>These steps will help you to know how to edit video with Filmora software;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start a new project.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png"
                      alt="filmora start new project"
                ></p>
<p>After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import your media</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"
                      alt="filmora import media"
                ></p>
<p>The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the <em>‘File &gt; Import Media Folder’</em> menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.</p>
<p>After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.</p>
<p>These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add clips to the timeline, trim, adjust appropriately and sequence them.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"
                      alt="filmora split video"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.</p>
<p>Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.</p>
<p>After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.</p>
<p>If you want to split a clip in the timeline, pick the scissors by clicking on the ‘_Scissors_’ icon.</p>
<p>When working on your video footage, click the spacebar of your computer keyboard to preview. By doing this, you will be able to see how your clips are joined together.</p>
<p>Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/modify-transitions-win-4.jpg"
                      alt="filmora add transitions"
                ></p>
<p>Click on the Effect icon at the top of the app and a deep visual library of effects will be visible. If you want to add a certain effect to your active clip, just double-click it.</p>
<p>Add transitions in your video timeline to cut the scene-to-scene. They are quite necessary as they help establish your audience’s attention.</p>
<p>The next thing after adding the transmissions will be adding the overlays and exporting your video by clicking on the ‘<em>Export</em>‘ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Export your finished video.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/export-to-local-win-1.png"
                      alt="filmora export video"
                ></p>
<p>You can click the ‘Export’ button and switch to the platform you want your video to be exported.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Choosing an appropriate video editing tool is equally as important as the video itself. And with the availability of so many of these video editing tools, choosing among them is quite hard. You can easily get confused especially if you are a beginner in the video editing industry. To avoid the complications you need to know what editing software is the best for your project.</p>

But the way one presents it or goes about filming clips also has a profound effect on the end product. And as you may know, not every aspect of a video production activity always goes without hiccups. But editing can come in clutch as it can easily solve minor problems like skewed footage that was shot at the wrong angle or is upside down (an issue that can happen while using mobile phones).</p>
<p>Thus, with this article, we will be looking at steps to rotate a video in Cyberlink PowerDirector to help you when required. We have also mentioned the steps you will need to follow in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X.</em></p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-Rotate-Videos-with-CyberLink-PowerDirector"><a href="#Steps-to-Rotate-Videos-with-CyberLink-PowerDirector" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector"></a>Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector</h2><p>Put yourself in a situation where you’ve just finished filming a project with your smartphone but end up realizing that the footage isn’t in the right orientation by default. While the error has an easy fix on most smartphones, you can also perform this action with video editing tools.</p>
<p>Also, while this form of rotating might be the most basic implementation of the feature, you can often use the feature to add a dynamic nature to your video with Keyframes.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Keyframes in Video Editing is a software feature that allows an editor to set start and endpoints (denoted by In and Out Markers), presenting the opportunity to custom clip properties between the two positions. The set changes occur gradually as the playhead continues moving through the clip. Properties that can undergo modification with this method are zoom, rotation, colors, positions, etc.</p>
<p>The process of rotating clips is fairly straightforward; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><em>If you do not have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html"><em>Cyberlink’s official website</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 and choose Full Mode.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-1.jpeg"
                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.</p>
<p>For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-2.jpeg"
                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-3.jpeg"
                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>EXTRA</strong></p>
<p>Rotation added in the PiP Designer will function as a keyframe-based rotation action. Right-click on the video in the preview window, choose Edit and then Modify to access this menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-4.jpeg"
                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p>Following this, you can click on the Motion Tab, go into Rotation Settings, and modify the angle with greater precision. In the Preview Window, you will now be able to see the rotating video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Accessing the rotate function while available in the forefront, the use of PiP Designer didn’t feel intuitive.</p>
<p>In Wondershare <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , rotating footage only happens via the Edit Option, and this straightforward approach felt simple. As for those who want to use Keyframes, the integration of this feature right above the Timeline is an appreciated convenience.</p>
<p>This emphasis on quick accessibility is present with almost every function in Filmora, and we believe this to be a significant advantage. The use of modern and unique iconography also increases familiarity, an aspect that will always be welcoming to new and budding creators.</p>
<p><em>If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website.</em></p>
<p>To help you learn how to use the rotate function and show you an example of the easy accessibility in Filmora, here is how you can use the feature to get the output you desire.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Once you have a new project open in Filmora, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import a Media File to edit into your Video Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the video clip onto the Timeline and then select it with a mouse click to activate further interactions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the Edit Option (marked in Red).</p>
<p>This will bring up the Edit Window in the left-top corner of your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the Transform Menu and use the Rotation Slider to edit the orientation.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong></p>
<p>Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn’t always the most accurate.</p>
<p>And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.</p>

<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn’t always the most accurate.</p>
<p>And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.</p>
<p>For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.</p>

<p>This effect may be used for a number of reasons, including clip transitions, speeding up a clip to make it shorter, and slowing down a clip to make it longer. Speed ramping may be used with a number of various effects.</p>
<p>According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The ability to alter the speed of individual clips is one of Premiere Pro’s most important capabilities. While speed ramping is often used in sports highlights, changing the speed of video may be useful for a number of other types of material.</p>
<p>You’ll learn how to construct a spectacular speed ramp in Adobe Premiere Pro, beginning with capturing the proper kind of video and moving to advanced tips and methods. Following that, we’ll go through some ideas and inspiration for when to use a speed ramp in your circumstance.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#What-is-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="What is Speed Ramping?"></a>What is Speed Ramping?</h2><p>A speed ramp is used to gradually increase the speed of a video clip as it accelerates or decelerates. It is guaranteed that a smooth transition between two separate speeds will take place. The method is crucial in changing the tempo of the film and, as a consequence, creating a dramatic impression. The film’s required velocity is achieved by the employment of super-fast visual effects.</p>
<p>A speed ramp, as opposed to a rapid shift in speed, provides for a more smooth transition between two drastically differing speeds. This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.</p>

Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.</p>
<p>You may also use Speed Ramping to alter the runtime of your video to fit the time limits of other social media sites, such as Instagram and Vine. If you just have 30 seconds to deliver your video, the following are the two most common places where people apply speed ramping techniques:</p>

<p>If you want to go deep into the game, Speed Ramp offers some more advanced options that give you even more control over your speed modifications. The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<p>If you want to go deep into the game, Speed Ramp offers some more advanced options that give you even more control over your speed modifications. The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-1"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-1" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-1"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-1" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-1"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<h3 id="Speed-Ramping-Tips-1"><a href="#Speed-Ramping-Tips-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramping Tips"></a>Speed Ramping Tips</h3><ul>
<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-2"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-2" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-2"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-2" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-2"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-2" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-3"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-3" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-3"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-3" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-3"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-3" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<h3 id="Speed-Ramping-Tips-3"><a href="#Speed-Ramping-Tips-3" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramping Tips"></a>Speed Ramping Tips</h3><ul>
<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<p><strong>●</strong> Promote videos – can utilize time to promote their videos on other social media platforms or collaborate with other content creators for promotions.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Provide Topic</strong></p>
<p>Here you need to provide the topic’s name on which we are planning to create the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>
<p>Based on the topic name and keywords, the tool will generate suggestions for the video ideas using the Neural Network concept of Artificial Learning.</p>

<p>Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>

<h3 id="Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Using Track Mattes in After Effects"></a>Using Track Mattes in After Effects</h3><p>In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p>

                      alt="alpha track matte"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p>

Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements.

<h5 id="Step-3-1"><a href="#Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip.

<h3 id="Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Using Track Mattes in After Effects"></a>Using Track Mattes in After Effects</h3><p>In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p>

                      alt="alpha track matte"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h5 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3-2"><a href="#Step-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p>

Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-3"><a href="#Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p>

<h5 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set “Mask Mode” from the timeline to “Subtract.” This will remove the selected object from the clip.</p>

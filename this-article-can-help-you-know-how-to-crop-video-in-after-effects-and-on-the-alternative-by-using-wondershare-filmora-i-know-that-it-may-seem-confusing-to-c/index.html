<h2 id="04-Smilebox-2"><a href="#04-Smilebox-2" class="headerlink" title="04 Smilebox"></a>04 Smilebox</h2><p>Smilebox is an automatic video collage maker that is capable of turning photographs into a video collage without much input from you It’s the tool to use if all you’re looking for is a quick solution. By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety</p>
<p>It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>

It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done</p>
<p>Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free <strong>music photo collage</strong> tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.</p>

The layouts in question are customizable, allowing you to control what your <strong>music photo collages</strong> look like in the end. You also have the choice of creating said collage with photos, videos, GIFs, and music</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Now, however, not only can you create a moving collage (with images, videos, GIFs, etc.) but you can even add music to it</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> These types of <strong>music photo collage</strong>s are really fun to share with friends and family online. And, these days, there are even digital picture frames that will allow you to display them in your home (and yes, some of these picture frames do come with speakers for playing music)</p>

<p>It is definitely possible Usually, people use video collage makers for this reason. But you can also create an actual photo collage with music as well (no need to use actual video clips if you don’t want to.)</p>
<p>In the end, it all depends on the collage maker you’re using to be completely honest. In this case, the collage maker in question would have to have video editing functionalities advanced enough to allow you to create a video consisting of a picture collage with music Learn more about the different tools that you can check out below as we break down some of the best of the best available</p>
<h2 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>The first of the video makers that we’re going to be introducing is called Filmora. This is a professional editor that’s equipped with just about everything you need for creating high-quality video content. That includes the things that you will need in order to create a <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>
<p>For your reference, that means that you can use it to create a video showing off a picture collage with music. Usually by making use of the templates provided by the software and uploading your own images (although, in the newest version of Filmora, Filmora V11, there is a ‘Stock Media’ option that includes an endless supply of photographs, videos, music, etc. for adding to your content.)</p>

<h2 id="02-Canva-3"><a href="#02-Canva-3" class="headerlink" title="02 Canva"></a>02 Canva</h2><p>Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a <strong>picture collage with music</strong></p>
<p>Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)</p>

<h2 id="03-Express-It-3"><a href="#03-Express-It-3" class="headerlink" title="03 Express It"></a>03 Express It</h2><p>You can say that “Express It” is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a <strong>photo collage with music</strong> <strong>app</strong> that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>
<p>FAQs about GoPro Video Editing:</p>

</ol>
<p>Yes, GoPro has its own video editor “Quik”. It is available on mobile phones and desktops both. It is simple and easy to use. It provides basic features to edit your video.

Although this isn’t the issue with Quik mobile app, here you can import videos from other devices also.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Can I make videos for social media with a GoPro?</strong></li>

<ol>

Just think of it as cutting something on your video so you can see what’s in the bottom layer. So, without wasting time, let me show you how to mask a video in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="fire up wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>

<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="click the effect button"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="film the subject walking from one side of the tree"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tell your subject to walk to the marker"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import the clip into filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="customize the clip with a mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="customize the clip with a mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>

                      alt="double-click the video track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

                      alt="unhide the first track on the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Launch Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Download and install the latest version of Wondershare Filmora on your computer. Launch the software and click on “New Project” to open a blank window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create new video project"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import TikTok Video</strong></p>
<p>Start by adding the TikTok video that needs to be edited across Wondershare Filmora. Click on the “Arrow” icon across the “Media” tab to import the required video. As you’ve added it, drag it across the timeline to start editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/tiktok-slow-zoom-video-7.jpg"
                      alt="add tiktok video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Cut Down the Clip for Video Editing</strong></p>
<p>At first, you need to clip the part of the video where you want to add the <strong>slow zoom effect TikTok.</strong> Place the red indicator across the pointer where you want to start the part and hit the split icon. Drag the indicator across the next frames to the point where you want to keep the audio. You will have a separate clip now.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split the video clip"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Specify Slow Speed of Clip</strong></p>
<p>Select the clip and find the “Speed” icon across the menu above the timeline of the interface. Select the appropriate speed from the drop-down menu that appears on the screen. Go into the “Slow” section and select speeds like 0.5x to slow down the clip speed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/tiktok-slow-zoom-video-9.jpg"
                      alt="choose slow speed for video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Include Animation Keyframes</strong></p>
<p>Proceed to add animation keyframes on the specific clip. Right-click on it and select “Add Animation” from the menu. Proceed into the “Animation” tab and find the “Customize” section across the screen. Move the indicator to the point where you want to add the first keyframe and hit “Add.” Move the indicator further across the clip to add the second keyframe across it. The reason for adding multiple keyframes is to set up the animation keyframe across the TikTok clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Change the Scale Clip and Export</strong></p>
<p>As you have made respective edits across the video, double click to open a new range of settings for it. Click on the “Transform” menu to open a list of different options. Locate the “Scale” option among them and manage the scaling of the clip through the slider percentages. Once done, click on the “Export” button to download the edited TikTok.</p>

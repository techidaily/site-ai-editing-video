But believe me; it’s not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.</p>
<p>That’s why in this brief guide, we’ll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio &amp; video when a single camera can record both. So let’s first answer this simple question.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-We-Need-to-Sync-Separate-Audio-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-We-Need-to-Sync-Separate-Audio-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio &amp; Video?"></a>Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio &amp; Video?</h2><p>Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can’t expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That’s why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.</p>
<p>You might think it’s an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg"
                      alt="recording audio and video separately for higher quality"
                ></p>
<p>But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don’t do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn’t it?</p>
<p>Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let’s first see what preparations we need. After that, we’ll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let’s begin our journey.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Preparation-for-Syncing-Audio-With-Video-During-Recording"><a href="#Part-2-Preparation-for-Syncing-Audio-With-Video-During-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording"></a>Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording</h2><p>You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It’s to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.</p>
<p>And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.</p>

<p>Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It’s best to clap before you say “Action” or speak so that it’s easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a <strong>Tail Slate</strong>!!!</p>
<p>After you’ve recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world’s leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora.

<p>As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let’s start with the manual process first.</p>

<h5 id="Step2Import-your-files"><a href="#Step2Import-your-files" class="headerlink" title="Step2Import your files"></a>Step2Import your files</h5><p>The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the “New Project” button from the opening interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on the new project"
                ></p>
<p>When a new project is created, you’ll see an “Import Media” section on it. Click on this section to browse your audio and video files from the computer. Or you can also drag and drop these files here to import them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step3Prepare-your-files"><a href="#Step3Prepare-your-files" class="headerlink" title="Step3Prepare your files"></a>Step3Prepare your files</h5><p>Now, it’s time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the “Import Media” section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we’ll see a spike.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bonus Tip:</em></strong> <em>If you can’t find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier.</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="find the sound spike on video and audio files"
                ></p>
<p>Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>That’s it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let’s see how to do it now.</p>

Or you can also use the “Ctrl+Alt+D” as the hotkey.</p>

<p>Once the audio file has been separated, you can move forward and delete it. To delete this audio, right-click on it and select “Delete.”</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments about your thoughts on these tools. You could also make your own pros and cons of these mp4 video croppers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>

<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>

In this article, we’ll be sharing with you the 10 best Spanish text-to-speech converter websites that you can use for free. But before actually moving to the list, here is a little information on this topic.</p>
<p>When it comes to free text to speech converter websites, there are a lot of them on the internet but not all of them support the Spanish language as the majority of websites only support English.

However, we have tried our very best to provide you with a list of the best TTS converter websites that offer the highest benefits with the lowest limitations for free. Therefore, some websites in this list might be completely free while some might have a free plan to use but whatever they might be, know that they offer the best for something that’s free and includes support for Spanish.</p>

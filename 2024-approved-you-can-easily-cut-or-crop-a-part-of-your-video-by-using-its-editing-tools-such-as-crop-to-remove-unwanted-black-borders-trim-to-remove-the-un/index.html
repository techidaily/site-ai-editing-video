It has many of the features of Adobe Premiere, but it is free.</p>
<p>It supports the following formats: AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, MOV, FLV and 3GP.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is different than most video editors in that it does not use timelines. Instead, the user edits clips in a storyboard and adds effects and titles to them. It also has an Audio Visualization feature that plays back music in your collection and shows what you’re listening to in real time. There is no voice-over tool and it is not possible to add an audio track.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora has a very large number of effects, all editable via keyframes. These include simple motion graphics such as fades and dissolves, but it also includes advanced options like motion blur and chroma-key. There are free downloadable effects, which are created by users.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora supports text editing and there is a large library of free fonts available for download on its website. It does not support green-screening&#x2F;chroma-keying. This can be done in post production via Adobe Premiere or other software.</p>
<p>It also has the ability to add a number of different titles, which can be stacked and moved around in 3D space.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora allows you to import photos for use in slideshows and effects. Every clip or image can have its own effect applied to it if desired.</p>
<p>After editing, the project is rendered in real time with no waiting. You can also choose to render only part of the video by selecting the time range.</p>
<p>One final bonus is Wondershare Filmora’s media library, which allows users to add files from their computer and sort them by category. This makes finding your desired video a much easier task.</p>
<p>This software has a very simple interface that is easy to navigate, even for beginners. The design of the program makes it intuitive enough that you can start editing videos right away without having to go through tutorials. It is easy to create the desired effects and titles that you need for your video with just a few clicks. Its editing tools are powerful enough for professional use while still being easy to learn.</p>
<p>The one downside is that Wondershare Filmora does not support 4K resolution—the maximum output size is 1080p.</p>

<p>Wondershare Filmora allows you to import photos for use in slideshows and effects. Every clip or image can have its own effect applied to it if desired.</p>
<p>After editing, the project is rendered in real time with no waiting. You can also choose to render only part of the video by selecting the time range.</p>
<p>One final bonus is Wondershare Filmora’s media library, which allows users to add files from their computer and sort them by category. This makes finding your desired video a much easier task.</p>
<p>This software has a very simple interface that is easy to navigate, even for beginners. The design of the program makes it intuitive enough that you can start editing videos right away without having to go through tutorials. It is easy to create the desired effects and titles that you need for your video with just a few clicks. Its editing tools are powerful enough for professional use while still being easy to learn.</p>
<p>The one downside is that Wondershare Filmora does not support 4K resolution—the maximum output size is 1080p.</p>

Without further ado, let us dive into the step by step process of making an <strong>Aquasoft slide show</strong> in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>Detailed User Guide to Create Aquasoft Slideshow</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download the Software Program</strong></p>
<p>Visit the official Aquasoft website to initiate a free download the slideshow product kit to your Windows or MacOS compatible system and proceed to install and launch the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Project Selection</strong></p>
<p>Launching the Aquasoft slideshow program successfully will guide you to the latter’s welcome interface, where you will have to select a new slideshow project in the 4:3 aspect ratio. Move ahead with selecting a presentation layout by navigating to the ‘View’ tab in the toolbar at the top and clicking on the ‘Layout’ option from its dropdown menu. You will also see the project ‘Timeline’ appear at this instant.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Your Images</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with choosing the layout, navigate to the top toolbar again and hit the ‘Add’ tab. From the dropdown that follows, click on ‘Images’ to include a photo within the presentation. You can also include a complete directory of images by selecting the ‘Directory’ option from the ‘Add’ dropdown. Your chosen images will appear in the project ‘Timeline’.</p>
<p>If you want to rearrange the order of the selected images, you can do so by clicking on the ‘Edit’ tab in the toolbar at the top, followed by choosing the ‘Sort’ option from the dropdown that follows next. The app sets the images in a natural logical order, while also allowing you to rearrange them manually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Images"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Include a Background Music</strong></p>
<p>To complement your <strong>Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate</strong> presentation with a suitable background audio, visit the top toolbar and click on the ‘Add’ tab and select ‘Background Music’ from the list of options that appears next. A series of music titles will appear as you click on the ‘+’ icon in the ‘Background Music’ interface. You are allowed to reset the order of the listed music files through a mouse click.</p>
<p>If you want to remove the music titles, click on the ‘Trash Bin’ icon beside the ‘+’ button. To adjust the settings of a particular music tile, click on the same and make suitable parameter adjustments. When you are satisfied with the changes, click ‘OK’. Your final selections of the background music will appear in the app’s project timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Including Background Music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the default arrangements, you can also proceed to make adjustments in the transition play duration and even customize a transition style of your own with text and effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Playing the Presentation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Adjust Your Image Properties</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adjusting Image Properties"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Add Suitable Transitions</strong></p>
<p>If the randomly included transitions of the slideshow program do not suit your presentation style, choose to add your preferred one from the software’s ‘Transition Library’ and tap the ‘Adjust’ button to customise the properties of your selection. You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Transitions"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Images’ menu and hit the ‘Text’ tab to include text add-on within the slideshow images while formatting them suitably. You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button. To present a combined play of text and image, while avoiding the separate text animation, click on the ‘Show Text with Image’ checkbox at the bottom right corner of the ‘Images’ menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Including Text Customizations"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Add Comments to the Images</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Sound’ tab and enable your system’s microphone to add recorded comments to your slideshow. Start with clicking on the ‘Record’ button and narrate the comment. Don’t worry about the sync of image and comment play durations as the software program will automatically adjust both to be in line with each other.</p>
<p>If you are interested to add a particular sound file to a specific image, navigate to the ‘Yellow Folder’ at the top right corner to make your selection.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Image Comments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10: Adding Effects to the Images</strong></p>
<p>To complement the images of your <strong>Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate 12</strong> presentation with stunning images, navigate to the toolbar at the bottom of the editing workspace and click on the ‘Image Effects’ icon. To add the effect, drag it to a desired image in the project timeline. When you have reached the right place, drop the effect to apply it. To see the effect preview, navigate to the ‘Layout Designer Panel’ at the left, where you can find your image with the chosen effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Image Effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Collage Creation</strong></p>
<p>Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>
<p>Move ahead with expanding the collage, to ensure a proper display of the images. You can further, apply selected transitions to the created collage under the latter’s ‘Object Settings’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Creating an Image Collage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12: Edit Your Collage</strong></p>
<p>Start with selecting the first image of your collage and adjusting its size in the ‘Layout Designer’ through the position frame at the edges of the photo. Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/5-tips-for-aquasoft-slideshow-10.JPG"
                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Editing the Collage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13: Including a Chapter</strong></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with a single image track, proceed to add chapters to your presentation. Start with selecting the ‘Chapter’ object from the ‘Object Toolbar’ to insert the former in the timeline, followed by dragging 2 images into the same. Tap the ‘Play’ button to open the chapter and add suitable text and animation to it in similar way as you would do for a collage. Position the images at the desired place using the red ‘Position Bar’.</p>

While there are a number of underlying reasons to the user disloyalty, it is often observed that a variety of issues are put forward post the uninstallation process. Entering into the domain, let us talk about some of the potential causes and after effects of the Aquasoft Slideshow Premium software uninstallation in the following section:</p>
<h3 id="01Reasons-Behind-the-Uninstallation-of-Aquasoft-Slideshow-Premium-Software"><a href="#01Reasons-Behind-the-Uninstallation-of-Aquasoft-Slideshow-Premium-Software" class="headerlink" title="01Reasons Behind the Uninstallation of Aquasoft Slideshow Premium Software"></a>01Reasons Behind the Uninstallation of Aquasoft Slideshow Premium Software</h3><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Compatibility Issues</strong></p>
<p>Working with the aforesaid slideshow creator program tends to cause a distortion in the normalized running of the other already existing applications within your device. While some of them may encounter a temporary shutdown, others may permanently cease to operate, causing a great deal of inconvenience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Flawless Running Issues</strong></p>
<p>When using the tool on a regular basis, you may encounter frequent and periodic software crashes, along with a complete standby of the program, prohibiting you from moving ahead with the slideshow creation process, or a flawless execution of the created slideshow presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Re-installation Cringes</strong></p>
<p>The software enters into repeated installation and uninstallation cycles out of the blue, causing much inconvenience at the user’s disposal, making it a necessity to permanently get rid of the program.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Reduced User Credibility</strong></p>
<p>The software reviews often report of unsatisfied users with an unreliable working experience. If that was not enough, some of the most trusted product review websites and long term users of the program have rendered the utility to be malicious.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Absence in Control Panel</strong></p>
<p>While all your system and application software can be found on the Control Panel and Windows listings, the aforesaid slideshow creator program is an exception. This leads to the unavailability of troubleshooting methods and settings adjustments, in case the program encounters a problem while running.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Incomplete Removal</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest glitches with the software is that you possibly can never uninstall it completely, because some of the latter’s associated processes and software file traces tend to remain forever on your system, causing interference with the working of other programs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Never-ending Uninstallation Process</strong></p>
<p>While you may opt to take the program out of your system to get rid of the inconvenience, that too is not an easy process to say the least. The uninstallation process once initiated does not seem to reach its end to what you can call ages!</p>
<h3 id="02Uninstallation-Inconsistencies-of-Aquasoft-Slideshow-Premium-Software"><a href="#02Uninstallation-Inconsistencies-of-Aquasoft-Slideshow-Premium-Software" class="headerlink" title="02Uninstallation Inconsistencies of Aquasoft Slideshow Premium Software"></a>02Uninstallation Inconsistencies of Aquasoft Slideshow Premium Software</h3><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Uninstaller Issues</strong></p>
<p>Inconsistencies lie within the software itself, with its inbuilt uninstaller program refusing to work in cohesion with the assigned task. Sometimes it may refrain from opening up, while in other cases, the program comes to an unannounced run halt amid the uninstallation process.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Issues of File Processing</strong></p>

Pros and Coins about TS Video Format</h2><p>Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.</p>
<p>Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.</p>
<h3 id="Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of TS File Format"></a>Drawbacks of TS File Format</h3><p>Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices.

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS"><a href="#TS" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4"><a href="#MP4" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line"><a href="#Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format.

<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-1"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-1" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically.

This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.</p>
<p>Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-1"><a href="#TS-1" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-1"><a href="#MP4-1" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-3"><a href="#TS-3" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-3"><a href="#MP4-3" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format. We talked about how you can play TS files on VLC and also shed light on its pros and cons. Moreover, we also shared a video editor to edit your TS file format videos.

<p>What is a Lower Third</p>
<p>A lower third is text and&#x2F;or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.</p>
<p>A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.</p>
<p>Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Add-A-Lower-Third"><a href="#2-Why-Add-A-Lower-Third" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Add A Lower Third"></a>2. Why Add A Lower Third</h2><p>So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”</p>
<p>Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.</p>
<p>In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.</p>

<p>Why Add A Lower Third</p>
<p>Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.</p>
<p>As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.</p>
<h2 id="3-6-Quick-Tips-to-Add-A-Lower-Third"><a href="#3-6-Quick-Tips-to-Add-A-Lower-Third" class="headerlink" title="3. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third"></a>3. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third</h2><p>As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.</p>
<p>Tip #1</p>
<h6 id="Use-Readable-Font"><a href="#Use-Readable-Font" class="headerlink" title="Use Readable Font"></a>Use Readable Font</h6><p>Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.</p>
<p>Tip #2</p>
<h6 id="Don’t-Make-It-Too-Long"><a href="#Don’t-Make-It-Too-Long" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make It Too Long"></a>Don’t Make It Too Long</h6><p>There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.</p>
<p>Tip #3</p>
<h6 id="Use-Branding"><a href="#Use-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Use Branding"></a>Use Branding</h6><p>A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.</p>
<p>Tip #4</p>
<h6 id="Use-Templates"><a href="#Use-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Use Templates"></a>Use Templates</h6><p>Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.</p>
<p>Tip #5</p>
<h6 id="Keep-It-Simple"><a href="#Keep-It-Simple" class="headerlink" title="Keep It Simple"></a>Keep It Simple</h6><p>Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don’t use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.</p>
<p>Tip #6</p>
<h6 id="Emphasize-With-Your-Lower-Third"><a href="#Emphasize-With-Your-Lower-Third" class="headerlink" title="Emphasize With Your Lower Third"></a>Emphasize With Your Lower Third</h6><p>Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.</p>

<p>What is a Lower Third</p>
<p>A lower third is text and&#x2F;or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.</p>
<p>A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.</p>
<p>Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.</p>
<p>In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.</p>

<p>Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.</p>
<p>As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong> A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.</p>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.</p>
<p>Tip #1</p>
<h6 id="Use-Readable-Font-1"><a href="#Use-Readable-Font-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Readable Font"></a>Use Readable Font</h6><p>Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.</p>
<p>Tip #2</p>
<h6 id="Don’t-Make-It-Too-Long-1"><a href="#Don’t-Make-It-Too-Long-1" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make It Too Long"></a>Don’t Make It Too Long</h6><p>There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.</p>
<p>Tip #3</p>
<h6 id="Use-Branding-1"><a href="#Use-Branding-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Branding"></a>Use Branding</h6><p>A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.</p>
<p>Tip #4</p>
<h6 id="Use-Templates-1"><a href="#Use-Templates-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Templates"></a>Use Templates</h6><p>Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.</p>
<p>Tip #5</p>
<h6 id="Keep-It-Simple-1"><a href="#Keep-It-Simple-1" class="headerlink" title="Keep It Simple"></a>Keep It Simple</h6><p>Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don’t use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.</p>
<p>Tip #6</p>
<h6 id="Emphasize-With-Your-Lower-Third-1"><a href="#Emphasize-With-Your-Lower-Third-1" class="headerlink" title="Emphasize With Your Lower Third"></a>Emphasize With Your Lower Third</h6><p>Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.</p>

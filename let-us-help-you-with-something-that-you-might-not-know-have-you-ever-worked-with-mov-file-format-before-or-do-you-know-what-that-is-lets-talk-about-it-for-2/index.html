The cue behind these backgrounds is that they exclusively permit the object of focus to have an opaque or colored pixelation, while leaving the remaining pixels as transparent or colorless. This is beneficial in adding an extra spotlight to the main elements of your creation, while rendering the less important parts behind the scene.</p>
<p>Having known the credibility of transparent backgrounds in video crafting, you may feel motivated to try hands on experimenting with transparent backgrounds to uplift your graphic motion artwork.</p>
<p>Considering the most affordable picks of video editing software to choose from, you can rely on the ‘After Effects’ motion graphic template to kick start the creation process. When using the aforesaid template to export videos with transparent backgrounds, you need to adhere to the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch the After Effects Template</strong></p>
<p>Start with downloading the graphic template from its official website and launching the same on your system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select Your Video</strong></p>
<p>On a successful launch, the template welcomes you with its composition timeline and project panel. Here, you need to select a desired video from either of the two places to export with a transparent background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add to Queue</strong></p>
<p>Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Launch After Effects</strong></p>
<p>This one is an efficient motion graphics template that you can use to add a visible spunk to your graphic design artworks. Begin with launching the template in your system after an official website download of the same.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Film Ready</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to remove the black background in After Effects template, make sure that your footage is ready to take up the action.

The cue behind these backgrounds is that they exclusively permit the object of focus to have an opaque or colored pixelation, while leaving the remaining pixels as transparent or colorless. This is beneficial in adding an extra spotlight to the main elements of your creation, while rendering the less important parts behind the scene.</p>
<p>Having known the credibility of transparent backgrounds in video crafting, you may feel motivated to try hands on experimenting with transparent backgrounds to uplift your graphic motion artwork.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Select Your Video</strong></p>
<p>On a successful launch, the template welcomes you with its composition timeline and project panel. Here, you need to select a desired video from either of the two places to export with a transparent background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add to Queue</strong></p>
<p>Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.</p>

<p>Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet.

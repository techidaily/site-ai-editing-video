<p><strong>Specific Personality Traits: The Pragmatic Ones</strong></p>
<p>The pragmatic personality trait belongs to those who prefer a logical approach over an emotional one while making important decisions. If you have a pragmatic nature, you might stick to the straightforward attitude of looking at things, ahead of inclining towards the empathetic side.

One such character example is Kiritsugu Emiya from the anime series called Fate&#x2F;Zero.</p>
<p>Talking about the character in some detail, this character has a habit of sacrificing the smaller assets while hoping for bigger and greater opportunities.

<p>A downside of the pragmatic traits is their double faceted appearance to the viewers in case the latter fail to interpret the character in a correct form.

Ahead of the physical features and personality, you can even use your zodiac sign to identify your anime mirror. Discussing along the line, let us talk about some of the zodiac deciding constellations and the anime characters that correspond to the same in what follows next:</p>
<h3 id="01Taurus-Himsura-Kenshin"><a href="#01Taurus-Himsura-Kenshin" class="headerlink" title="01Taurus: Himsura Kenshin"></a>01Taurus: Himsura Kenshin</h3><p>Belonging to the Taurus constellation, you will have an inherent love for quietness and peace. Satisfying your love for nature, you would be more comfortable with enjoying the small pleasures of life. Talking of a relatable anime character, you bear a close resemblance with Kenshin, the main lead of the anime movie by the name Ruroni Kenshin. The latter went on to trade his murderous past to live a peaceful life in his present.</p>
<p>The major appeals of Kenshin’s character are a gentle and kind personality that caters to understand and care about everyone he comes across. Choosing to kill as the last option, he works to transform his sword into a no blood sucking object. Like most Taurus personalities, the only expectation Kenshin has is of leading a simple, happy and peaceful life around his loved ones.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="02Gemini-L-Lawliet"><a href="#02Gemini-L-Lawliet" class="headerlink" title="02Gemini: L Lawliet"></a>02Gemini: L Lawliet</h3><p>Being a Gemini, you may well be the master of a conflicting personality, which is commonly victimized of being misinterpreted. Possessing the strongest of thinking abilities, you might be a smart and intelligent philosopher. People belonging to this zodiac sign, however have a quite hidden out perspective of looking at the world. Being a Gemini, you may prefer being a bit antisocial person, who has his own unconventional ways of taking the challenges of life.</p>
<p>In the anime world, the aforesaid zodiac sign traits have the closest connections with Detective L Lawliet from the movie Death Note. The latter possesses a gray shade character, who never reveals his real motives and true colors. He often works out cunning ways and means to get something that suits his needs and wants, in line with a problem he aims to solve.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Lawliet always attempts to put the well-being of the society ahead of his personal interest in solving cases. While the character is both, complex and fascinating at the same time, a comparison with the latter is an indirect way of addressing yourself as an intelligent and a goal oriented personality. You should however, take care to stop losing your self-confidence amid the process of reaching at your desired goal.</p>

<h3 id="03Cancer-Takeshi-Natsume"><a href="#03Cancer-Takeshi-Natsume" class="headerlink" title="03Cancer: Takeshi Natsume"></a>03Cancer: Takeshi Natsume</h3><p>Talking of the specific characteristics of possessing a Cancarian personality, you will have a sensitive naughtiness and high level of empathy as the common aspects of your behavior. While you may encounter great difficulties to adjust with the world around you, don’t be skeptical about being alone in the race. Natsume, the title character of the anime Natsume’s Book of Friends shares this personality with you.</p>
<p>The striking aspect of this anime character is that its kindness remains untouched by the hardships that life has daunted upon him. The latter additionally obliges with respect towards the kindness he is showered on by other people. The thoughtful aspect of his character is however something that often works against him. The latter becomes oblivious to everything else to care about others’ feelings, making his sensitivity a cursed blessing for himself.</p>

                      alt="decrease zoom on discord"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You can reset the zoom settings to default by holding down the “Ctrl” key and hitting “0” on the keyboard. This will restore the settings back to the default 100%.</p>

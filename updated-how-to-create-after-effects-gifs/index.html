<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create <strong>after effects GIFs</strong> within a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.</p>
<p>However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.</p>
<p>Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.</p>
<p>You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.</p>

<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar"><a href="#01What’s-Similar" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>
<h3 id="02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition"><a href="#02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition" class="headerlink" title="02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition"></a>02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition</h3><p>In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>
<h3 id="03Vector-and-Shapes"><a href="#03Vector-and-Shapes" class="headerlink" title="03Vector and Shapes"></a>03Vector and Shapes</h3><p>You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.</p>
<h3 id="04Destructive-Effects"><a href="#04Destructive-Effects" class="headerlink" title="04Destructive Effects"></a>04Destructive Effects</h3><p>After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.</p>
<p>You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs"></a>Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs</h2><p>After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-1.jpg"
                      alt="new composition after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg"
                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg"
                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-5.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-6.jpg"
                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-7.jpg"
                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-8.jpg"
                      alt="render after effects"
                ></p>
<p>If you find <strong>exporting gifs from After Effects</strong> too complicated, you can also upload and loop videos using <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> which has plenty of other amazing video editing features you can drag and drop to create.</p>

<h3 id="02Converting-Animation-to-GIF-in-Photoshop"><a href="#02Converting-Animation-to-GIF-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="02Converting Animation to GIF in Photoshop"></a>02Converting Animation to GIF in Photoshop</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new file in Photoshop with the same specs as you did in After Effects. Now go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Import’ &gt; ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows &gt; Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-10.jpg"
                      alt="timeline photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ &gt; Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-11.jpg"
                      alt="export and save as gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ending-Thoughts"><a href="#Part-1-Ending-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ending Thoughts"></a>Part 1 Ending Thoughts</h2><p><strong>●</strong> GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe <strong>after effects gifs</strong> or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after <strong>exporting after effects to gif</strong>. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.</p>

In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>

                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>

                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.</p>

Now go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Import’ &gt; ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows &gt; Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="timeline photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ &gt; Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="export and save as gif photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-1"><a href="#Part-1-Ending-Thoughts-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ending Thoughts"></a>Part 1 Ending Thoughts</h2><p><strong>●</strong> GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe <strong>after effects gifs</strong> or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after <strong>exporting after effects to gif</strong>. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.</p>

<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create <strong>after effects GIFs</strong> within a matter of minutes.</p>

This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.</p>
<p>This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.</p>
<p>However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.</p>
<p>Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.</p>
<p>You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can provide instructions in a short span of time.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.</p>

<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar-2"><a href="#01What’s-Similar-2" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>

However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>

Now go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Import’ &gt; ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ &gt; Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.</p>

They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after <strong>exporting after effects to gif</strong>. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.</p>

<p>GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you won’t be able to <strong>make a gif in after effects</strong> directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.</p>
<p>Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.</p>
<p>In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create <strong>after effects GIFs</strong> within a matter of minutes.</p>

This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.</p>
<p>This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.</p>
<p>However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.</p>
<p>Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.</p>
<p>You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can provide instructions in a short span of time.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can display some amazing things on your website.</p>

<p>Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.</p>
<h3 id="01What’s-Similar-3"><a href="#01What’s-Similar-3" class="headerlink" title="01What’s Similar?"></a>01What’s Similar?</h3><p>Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.</p>
<h3 id="02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-3"><a href="#02Groups-PS-and-Nested-AE-Composition-3" class="headerlink" title="02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition"></a>02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition</h3><p>In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.</p>
<p>Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.</p>
<p>Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.</p>
<h3 id="03Vector-and-Shapes-3"><a href="#03Vector-and-Shapes-3" class="headerlink" title="03Vector and Shapes"></a>03Vector and Shapes</h3><p>You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.</p>
<h3 id="04Destructive-Effects-3"><a href="#04Destructive-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="04Destructive Effects"></a>04Destructive Effects</h3><p>After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.</p>
<p>You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-After-Effects-Gifs-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs"></a>Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs</h2><p>After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.</p>
<p>Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.</p>
<h3 id="01Animating-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#01Animating-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="01Animating in After Effects"></a>01Animating in After Effects</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="new composition after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg"
                      alt="project panel after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg"
                      alt="timeline panel"
                ></p>
<p>Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-5.jpg"
                      alt="set scale after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-6.jpg"
                      alt="repeat process"
                ></p>
<p>Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-7.jpg"
                      alt="set position"
                ></p>
<p>Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="render after effects"

</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now it’s time to edit the video. Make all the editing you want with graphics and visuals to finalize your video before using the audio mixer. And once it’s done, we can move to the first-class audio mixer of Filmora.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Before using the audio mixer, ensure you have a headphone to see the changes you are making instead of relying on your desktop speaker.</p>
<h5 id="Step3Start-the-audio-mixer"><a href="#Step3Start-the-audio-mixer" class="headerlink" title="Step3Start the audio mixer"></a>Step3Start the audio mixer</h5><p>To open up the audio mixer, click on the “audio mixer” icon on the toolbar below the preview window.</p>

                      alt="click on the audio mixer icon"
                ></p>
<p>This is what your audio mixer will look like at the start.</p>

                      alt="audio mixer starting interface"
                ></p>
<p>Now we can start adjusting the audio settings. Let’s go with the audio levels first.</p>
<h5 id="Step4Adjust-the-audio-levels"><a href="#Step4Adjust-the-audio-levels" class="headerlink" title="Step4Adjust the audio levels"></a>Step4Adjust the audio levels</h5><p>To adjust the audio levels, look at the left side of the audio mixer. Here you’ll see two vertical bars, which are;</p>
<ul>
<li>The audio levels for the video clip.</li>
<li>The audio levels for the sound and music in the music track.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can adjust the icon up or down to make these channels louder or softer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adjust the levels of your audio tracks"
                ></p>
<p>After the audio levels, let’s see how we can change the audio channels.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p>

<h5 id="Step5Adjust-the-audio-channels"><a href="#Step5Adjust-the-audio-channels" class="headerlink" title="Step5Adjust the audio channels"></a>Step5Adjust the audio channels</h5><p>See those circles above the audio levels? These are for adjusting the audio channels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotate the knob-like icon in these circles to adjust the Audio channels’ pan&#x2F;bounce control. This switches the sound between the left and right channels.</li>
<li>On top of that, you can see these changes on the channel control panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the channels of your audio tracks"
                ></p>
<p>To check the effect, let’s rotate the knob to the left. And to see the result hit the “Play” button on the bottom left corner of the audio mixer interface. Here’s how it looks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview of the adjusted audio tracks"
                ></p>
<p>Now it’s time to select the audio mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step6Select-the-audio-mode"><a href="#Step6Select-the-audio-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step6Select the audio mode"></a>Step6Select the audio mode</h5><p>The audio mixer of Filmora provides you with two audio mode options. These are;</p>
<p>● <strong>Stereo Mode</strong></p>
<p>In the Stereo mode, you can pan from left to right and control your audio just like the knob of the audio channel.</p>
<p>● <strong>Surround Mode</strong></p>
<p>You can pan from left to right and front to back in this mode by rotating the video or music icons. This provides you with complete control over the audio positions. But remember that this mode works best if your video is played with the surround sound system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the mode of your audio tracks"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have changed the audio mode, let’s look at the master levels.</p>
<h5 id="Step7Adjust-the-master-levels"><a href="#Step7Adjust-the-master-levels" class="headerlink" title="Step7Adjust the master levels"></a>Step7Adjust the master levels</h5><p>On the very left of the window, you’ll find the Master levels.</p>
<p>This is where you can adjust the master section or all your audio files on your timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just drag the master level slider upward and downwards, and you’ll notice the changes right away.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step5Adjust-the-audio-channels-1"><a href="#Step5Adjust-the-audio-channels-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Adjust the audio channels"></a>Step5Adjust the audio channels</h5><p>See those circles above the audio levels? These are for adjusting the audio channels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rotate the knob-like icon in these circles to adjust the Audio channels’ pan&#x2F;bounce control. This switches the sound between the left and right channels.</li>
<li>On top of that, you can see these changes on the channel control panel.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="adjust the channels of your audio tracks"
                ></p>
<p>To check the effect, let’s rotate the knob to the left. And to see the result hit the “Play” button on the bottom left corner of the audio mixer interface. Here’s how it looks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview of the adjusted audio tracks"
                ></p>
<p>Now it’s time to select the audio mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step6Select-the-audio-mode-1"><a href="#Step6Select-the-audio-mode-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6Select the audio mode"></a>Step6Select the audio mode</h5><p>The audio mixer of Filmora provides you with two audio mode options. These are;</p>
<p>● <strong>Stereo Mode</strong></p>
<p>In the Stereo mode, you can pan from left to right and control your audio just like the knob of the audio channel.</p>
<p>● <strong>Surround Mode</strong></p>
<p>You can pan from left to right and front to back in this mode by rotating the video or music icons. This provides you with complete control over the audio positions. But remember that this mode works best if your video is played with the surround sound system.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Once you have changed the audio mode, let’s look at the master levels.</p>
<h5 id="Step7Adjust-the-master-levels-1"><a href="#Step7Adjust-the-master-levels-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7Adjust the master levels"></a>Step7Adjust the master levels</h5><p>On the very left of the window, you’ll find the Master levels.</p>
<p>This is where you can adjust the master section or all your audio files on your timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just drag the master level slider upward and downwards, and you’ll notice the changes right away.</li>
</ul>

After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs.

<p>Click the <strong>Square</strong> icon, it is located beside the <strong>Pencil</strong> icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the <strong>Proportiona</strong>l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.</p>

<h2 id="How-Long-Does-It-Take-To-Edit-A-Video"><a href="#How-Long-Does-It-Take-To-Edit-A-Video" class="headerlink" title="How Long Does It Take To Edit A Video"></a>How Long Does It Take To Edit A Video</h2><p>If you want to put together the pieces for online videos the number one thing most of the time takes is <strong>editing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too many choices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Select the video and hit the <strong>speed</strong></li>
<li>You can select <strong>slow, fast, normal,</strong> and the most interesting one is <strong>speed ramping.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Speed ramping</strong> allows you to set automatically made patterns to slow down then fast again slow. It will create a cinematic effect in the video. But this feature is only for paid users.</li>

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time.

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

This means when a clip is trimmed, it causes a ripple effect throughout the rest of your timeline, shifting all other clips into a new timeline position.</p>
<p>Similarly, when working with lengthy timelines, the Razor tool is also really helpful because you can select the clip you wish to cut by dragging your razor over it. So, the Razor cut is the tool to use if you need to make a lot of cuts in your videos quickly.</p>

As we have seen, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gives you a wealth of options to customize the title in various ways including changing the font size, color, and type all from the text editing panel.

Why Should I add Text to my Video?</h3><p>Adding text and titles to any video can be very important for several reasons. For instance, you can decide to add text to emphasize a point, add a call to action and even help your audience to follow along with the content when the audio is turned off. Titles and any other text that you add to a video can also make the content more understandable, engaging, and clearer. But the effectiveness of the text will depend on how and where you place the text within the video and the video editor you choose can be very instrumental in this regard.</p>

Once you have all these details, you then need to choose a video editor that offers a wide range of fonts and colors to choose from. Thankfully, <strong>Filmora</strong> offers all the colors, fonts, and animations you could ever need, allowing you to customize the text any way you want.</p>

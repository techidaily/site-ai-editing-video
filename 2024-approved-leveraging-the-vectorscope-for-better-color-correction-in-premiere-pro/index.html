When two people look at the same picture, they may see different shades of colors. In post-production, Vectorscopes help to color grade and make sure you get your images exactly right. This means that you will process the exact color that you want across devices. <strong>Premiere Vectorscope</strong> is a great choice for anyone looking to correct and grade colors. Using Vectorscope Premiere allows you to get quantitative data about your image for a more accurate assessment of colors within the film. In this article, we explore what comprises Premiere Pro Vectorscope and how to use them in video editing.</p>

Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read"></a><strong>Part 1. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read</strong></h2><p>Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.</p>
<p>The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope"><a href="#How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope" class="headerlink" title="How to Read a Vectorscope"></a><strong>How to Read a Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="reading vectorscope"
                ></p>
<p>The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.</p>
<p>Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.</p>
<p>Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Vectorscope-in-Premiere-Pro-A-Brief-Guide"><a href="#Part-2-Vectorscope-in-Premiere-Pro-A-Brief-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.</p>
<p>The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:</p>
<h3 id="1-Reading-a-Vectorscope-on-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#1-Reading-a-Vectorscope-on-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro"></a><strong>1. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro</strong></h3><p>A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).</p>

                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.</p>

<h3 id="2-Adjusting-Skin-Tones"><a href="#2-Adjusting-Skin-Tones" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjusting Skin Tones"></a><strong>2. Adjusting Skin Tones</strong></h3><p>A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate</p>
<p>The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.</p>

It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.</p>
<p>The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope-1"><a href="#How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Read a Vectorscope"></a><strong>How to Read a Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="reading vectorscope"
                ></p>
<p>The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.</p>
<p>Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.</p>
<p>Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Vectorscope-in-Premiere-Pro-A-Brief-Guide-1"><a href="#Part-2-Vectorscope-in-Premiere-Pro-A-Brief-Guide-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Vectorscope in Premiere Pro: A Brief Guide"></a><strong>Part 2.</strong> <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Vectorscope in Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: A Brief Guide</strong></h2><p>Just like many other video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro offers Vectorscope to help in post-production. The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.</p>
<p>The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:</p>
<h3 id="1-Reading-a-Vectorscope-on-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#1-Reading-a-Vectorscope-on-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro"></a><strong>1. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro</strong></h3><p>A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).</p>

                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.</p>

<h3 id="2-Adjusting-Skin-Tones-1"><a href="#2-Adjusting-Skin-Tones-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjusting Skin Tones"></a><strong>2. Adjusting Skin Tones</strong></h3><p>A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate</p>
<p>The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.</p>

Talking of the most recent add-ons to the already long list of utilities, storyboards have emerged as a revolution in the field of motion graphic customization and design.</p>
<p>Diving a bit deeper into understanding the credibility of storyboards, let us move ahead with having an insight of different aspects and elements of the same in the upcoming sections of this article:</p>
<p><strong>What is a Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Attempting to define a <strong>storyboard</strong>, you can regard the utility as a sequential setup of sketches, images, elements and illustrations that create a road map to address a video editing task. Dividing the entire process into a series of individual processes, the aforesaid facility caters to ease out the video creation task.</p>
<p>Moving ahead to draft a technical explanation of storyboards, they are a collection of chronologically arranged drawings, supplemented with video customization elements, such as dialogues, camera direction and other allied detailing. The fundamental merit of these visual arrangements lies in the sequential and scene unfolding of a video footage.</p>
<p>This in turn, works to simplify the film creation process, while ensuring the latter’s cohesiveness and facilitating the elimination of errors and inconsistencies. It is a common mistake to regard storyboards as a midway and optional utility, these trial and error representations are quite essential to ensure a flawless video output in the final stage of design. The facility works additionally to minimize unnecessary production delays, while significantly cutting down on the overall creation cost.</p>
<p>Having a visibility more or less similar to a comic strip, storyboards have a varying scale of design, ranging from being modestly simple to explicitly complex, in cohesion with the specific creation requirements. These visual scripts are mostly hand crafted, through there are a host of storyboard creation software packages and programs available in the IT design market, as well as across the web.</p>
<p>Extending our discussion a bit further, let us have a walk-through of the essential storyboard categories and types in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Traditional Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>These are a logically placed sequence of hand crafted drawings in ink or pencil for representing the video filming chronology, prior to the start of the actual creation process. You can conveniently observe the sequential arrangement of your video elements through these storyboards by placing them at a suitable space, like your studio wall.</p>
<p>You are granted the liberty to add as much detailing to these drawings as you wish, while using them for filming either a single or a series of film shots. These easily editable storyboards are often supplemented with written text notes for describing the events of a specific scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Thumbnail Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>These are rather small storyboards, mostly of a postage stamp size, that depict a sequence of the video elements and scenes on separate paper pieces. Owing to their miniature size, these storyboards are relatively easier to craft, require a lesser creation time and have much fewer details in comparison to their traditional counterparts.</p>
<p>This category of storyboards comes credible in catering a quick jot down of video creation ideas, before you proceed to analyze each element in a more comprehensive manner through the traditional alternatives.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animated Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>This class of storyboards comes into play when you aim to craft complex video outlines, while supplementing the same with additional elements of music and dialogues. These are designed essentially to depict the general scene flow through the characteristics of time and pace in a series of animated sketches.</p>
<p>As of creating these storyboards, there is a diversity of online and software based utilities to address the concern. Such facilities work to integrate the images within a sketch into a single video, while adding life to the footage within a span of several minutes. The creation process is quite simple, without a download or software learning requirement.</p>

Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>

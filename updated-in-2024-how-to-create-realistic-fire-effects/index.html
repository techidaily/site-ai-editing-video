It saves them from potential danger in production and helps them manage the time required to create a project. In this article, you will get pro tips and easy ways to add Fire effects by Wondershare Filmora.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> let’s not count Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan productions because their movies have a higher budget, and creating fake fire is easy.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-do-you-need-to-create-fire-effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-do-you-need-to-create-fire-effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?"></a>Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?</h2><p>Using simple tools such as Filmora and visual effects, you can create a realistic fire effect with an easy setup. For filming the effect, we will need</p>
<ol>
<li>A good camera</li>
<li>A light source</li>
<li>Video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</li>
<li>Basic editing skills</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the light source is key to the fire effects. It will be beneficial if you have a <strong>warmer color</strong> light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use <strong>tungsten</strong> light bulbs or small circular <strong>LEDs</strong> that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.</p>

How to make a realistic effect fire?</h2><p>After getting prepared, it’s time to do the real things. Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Record-your-footage"><a href="#Step1-Record-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Record your footage"></a>Step1 Record your footage</h5><p>While recording the video, you can <strong>slightly shake</strong> your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.</p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light manually</strong></p>
<p>Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.</p>

                      alt="shaking the light source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light using a dimmer</strong></p>
<p>You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a <strong>dimmer</strong>, your work will be more accessible.</p>
<p>A <strong>regulator</strong> on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.</p>

Ensure the camera is placed under a <strong>good light</strong> source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the <strong>level of the eye</strong> so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind to <strong>zoom out</strong> the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object. The more natural the acting is, the more realistic would be the fire effect.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> download the latest version of filmora. It will give you a pro version and help you to create more realistic fire effects.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create a new project and import the recorded clips</strong></p>
<p>Before adding the fire effects to your video, you must ensure that you are familiar with the editing software. Your first step would be to add your clips to the <strong>timeline.</strong> Drag the footage from the library and enter it into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>3. create the fire effect more realistic by adding smoke</strong></p>
<p>The next step would be to add smoke to the fire. As it is only fair that the fire makes the smoke so. Adding the smoke will create the fire effect more realistic. Follow the below steps to get your cinematic video!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects"><a href="#Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects" class="headerlink" title="#Step1 Search for smoke effects"></a>#Step1 Search for smoke effects</h5><p>To add the smoke effect, click on the element’s icon on the bar above and search for <strong>smokescreen 2.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect"><a href="#Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect" class="headerlink" title="#Step2 Add a smoke effect"></a>#Step2 Add a smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have searched and found the smoke screen 2 effects, then <strong>import</strong> that effect onto your timeline so that you can begin editing.</p>

                      alt="adding smokescreen2 effect"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’ve added the fire effect, you will notice the change on the screen in the top right corner.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-duration"><a href="#Step3-Add-duration" class="headerlink" title="#Step3 Add duration"></a>#Step3 Add duration</h5><p>The next step would be to set the duration of the smokescreen effect so that it <strong>matches the length of the video</strong>. To do so,</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the edge of the smoke screen effect.</li>
<li>Drag it to the right if the effect appears <strong>smaller</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>And drag it to the left if it is <strong>larger</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>As soon as it matches the length of the video, leave the drag, and it will fit right into place.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect"><a href="#Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect" class="headerlink" title="#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect"></a>#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have matched the duration of the smoke screen effect to the video clip, our next step would be to make some changes. These changes will make the <strong>smokescreen appear more pleasing</strong>—<strong>double-click</strong> on the smokescreen effect, which will open the transform menu.</p>
<p>We would first focus on the transform panel. Here you would have many options, but our focus would be on <strong>rotation, scale, and position</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure to rotate the smoke screen effect by simply sliding the slider or dragging the slider right or left to your desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>You would have created an <strong>angle</strong> of the smokescreen to make it more natural.</li>
<li>Now, we would have to adjust the <strong>scale</strong> of the smokescreen effect.</li>
<li>Drag the slider to the right to expand the smoke to spread on the screen. It will help the smoke screen do appear more natural.</li>
<li>You can adjust how much the smoke screen is visible on the screen by decreasing the opacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust the slider to the <strong>left</strong> so it blends in with the flickering of the light we created. Now playback the video from the big screen to get an idea of the effect you added. And here are our parameters for reference.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the slider"
                ></p>
<p>Cool, isn’t it? Now we have added smoke to our timeline. Combined with the flickering light effect, we are closer to our goal.</p>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, <strong>click</strong> on the bar above the element’s icon.</li>
<li>Once you have opened the elements tab, look to your <strong>left</strong> window, where further options are available.</li>
<li>From these options, click on the <strong>fire tab</strong>.</li>
<li>A new window will <strong>pop up</strong> in the library panel.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-the-flame-to-the-timeline"><a href="#Step2-Add-the-flame-to-the-timeline" class="headerlink" title="#Step2 Add the flame to the timeline"></a>#Step2 Add the flame to the timeline</h5><p>Click on a large scale <strong>14</strong> and drag it into your timeline above the smoke effect and the clip. Doing so would have created <strong>two extra layers</strong> after the video tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step3-Adjust-the-flame-effect"><a href="#Step3-Adjust-the-flame-effect" class="headerlink" title="#Step3 Adjust the flame effect"></a>#Step3 Adjust the flame effect</h5><p>Now, we have to do steps similar to the ones above the first job. But first, you have to click on the edges of the effect. Then, match it to the length of your video.</p>
<p>Now, remember if the length of the effect is <strong>more</strong> than that of the video clip. You can adjust it by clicking on the edge and dragging it to the <strong>left</strong>. And if it appears to be <strong>smaller</strong> than the video clip, drag the edge to the <strong>right</strong> to match the length.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Blend-the-video"><a href="#Step4-Blend-the-video" class="headerlink" title="#Step4 Blend the video"></a>#Step4 Blend the video</h5><p>When you look at the effect as you play the video from the start, you will notice that <strong>the effect is a little more intense</strong> than we want. To change it to your desires, you can follow the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First of all,</strong> double-click and open the <strong>transform</strong></li>
<li>Experiment with the <strong>rotation</strong> and the <strong>scale</strong> and position; make your choice.</li>
<li>Then move on to the compositing panel and focus on the <strong>blending mode</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you will notice a <strong>drop-down panel</strong> and select the screen option from all the other options.</li>
<li>Doing so would help you blend the spark effect video much better.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you focus on the spark effect that appears on the screen, you will notice that it seems to be much more intense than we require. If you want to blend it further, you can use <strong>the opacity adjuster</strong> and decrease the transparency. <strong>Then, adjust</strong> the slider till you feel it to be just right.</p>
<p>And the following are ideal parameters of our adjustment just for you to refer to.</p>

What do you need to create fire effects?"></a>Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?</h2><p>Using simple tools such as Filmora and visual effects, you can create a realistic fire effect with an easy setup. For filming the effect, we will need</p>
<ol>
<li>A good camera</li>
<li>A light source</li>
<li>Video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</li>
<li>Basic editing skills</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the light source is key to the fire effects. It will be beneficial if you have a <strong>warmer color</strong> light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use <strong>tungsten</strong> light bulbs or small circular <strong>LEDs</strong> that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.</p>

How to make a realistic effect fire?</h2><p>After getting prepared, it’s time to do the real things. Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Record-your-footage-1"><a href="#Step1-Record-your-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Record your footage"></a>Step1 Record your footage</h5><p>While recording the video, you can <strong>slightly shake</strong> your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.</p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light manually</strong></p>
<p>Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="shaking the light source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light using a dimmer</strong></p>
<p>You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a <strong>dimmer</strong>, your work will be more accessible.</p>
<p>A <strong>regulator</strong> on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.</p>

<h5 id="Step3-Adjust-the-flame-effect-1"><a href="#Step3-Adjust-the-flame-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step3 Adjust the flame effect"></a>#Step3 Adjust the flame effect</h5><p>Now, we have to do steps similar to the ones above the first job. But first, you have to click on the edges of the effect. Then, match it to the length of your video.</p>
<p>Now, remember if the length of the effect is <strong>more</strong> than that of the video clip. You can adjust it by clicking on the edge and dragging it to the <strong>left</strong>. And if it appears to be <strong>smaller</strong> than the video clip, drag the edge to the <strong>right</strong> to match the length.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Blend-the-video-1"><a href="#Step4-Blend-the-video-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step4 Blend the video"></a>#Step4 Blend the video</h5><p>When you look at the effect as you play the video from the start, you will notice that <strong>the effect is a little more intense</strong> than we want. To change it to your desires, you can follow the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First of all,</strong> double-click and open the <strong>transform</strong></li>
<li>Experiment with the <strong>rotation</strong> and the <strong>scale</strong> and position; make your choice.</li>
<li>Then move on to the compositing panel and focus on the <strong>blending mode</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you will notice a <strong>drop-down panel</strong> and select the screen option from all the other options.</li>
<li>Doing so would help you blend the spark effect video much better.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you focus on the spark effect that appears on the screen, you will notice that it seems to be much more intense than we require. If you want to blend it further, you can use <strong>the opacity adjuster</strong> and decrease the transparency. <strong>Then, adjust</strong> the slider till you feel it to be just right.</p>
<p>And the following are ideal parameters of our adjustment just for you to refer to.</p>

<p><strong>Freeze frame</strong> effect in video editing is a skill that requires more practice to master. It adds drama and impact to movies. If you want to see more energy and acting in the videos you watch, then you should see more freeze-frame examples.</p>
<p>Sometimes we notice that a particular action stays on longer than necessary in a movie or video. The filmmakers use this skill to emphasize some intense moments further to sustain or pique your interest.</p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing feature is a valuable skill that helps filmmakers make excellent movies. We have a list of the top 12 examples of freeze-frame effects in movies for you.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Freeze-Frame-Video-Editing"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Freeze-Frame-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?</strong></h2><p><strong>Freeze frame</strong> video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Ways-to-Use-Freeze-Frame-in-Video-editing"><a href="#Part-2-Ways-to-Use-Freeze-Frame-in-Video-editing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing"></a>Part 2 <strong>Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing</strong></h2><p>Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the beginning of a movie&#x2F;video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience’s interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This <strong>freeze-frame</strong> technique was used in the film ‘Good Fellas’ to pique the audience’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The ‘breakfast club’ filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie ‘The Departed.’</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Best-Freeze-Frame-Video-Editing-Examples"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Best-Freeze-Frame-Video-Editing-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?"></a>Part 3 <strong>What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?</strong></h2><p>It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.</p>
<p>But several movie directors have effectively used the <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing technique that wowed the audience.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the best <strong>freeze frame examples</strong> you would love;</p>
<h3 id="01The-Departed"><a href="#01The-Departed" class="headerlink" title="01The Departed"></a>01<strong>The Departed</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The Departed"
                ></p>
<p>In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.</p>
<p>He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.</p>
<h3 id="02Rocky-III"><a href="#02Rocky-III" class="headerlink" title="02Rocky III"></a>02<strong>Rocky III</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-2.jpg"
                      alt="Rocky III"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.</p>
<p>During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.</p>
<p>The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, “Ding Dong.”</p>
<p>The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.</p>
<h3 id="03400-Blows"><a href="#03400-Blows" class="headerlink" title="03400 Blows"></a>03<strong>400 Blows</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="400 blows"
                ></p>
<p>In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.</p>
<p>In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.</p>
<p>He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="04Thelma-and-Louise"><a href="#04Thelma-and-Louise" class="headerlink" title="04Thelma and Louise"></a>04<strong>Thelma and Louise</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-4.jpg"
                      alt="Thelma and Louise"
                ></p>
<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>
<p>Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.</p>
<h3 id="05The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street"><a href="#05The-Wolf-of-Wall-Street" class="headerlink" title="05The Wolf of Wall Street"></a>05<strong>The Wolf of Wall Street</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The wolf of wall street"
                ></p>
<p>Scorsese uses freeze-frame at the beginning of this movie, just as he did in Good Fellas. The freeze-frame effect here helps introduce the character and shows us the plot of the movie hence piquing the audience’s interests immediately.</p>
<h3 id="06Out-of-Sight"><a href="#06Out-of-Sight" class="headerlink" title="06Out of Sight"></a>06<strong>Out of Sight</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Out of Sight"
                ></p>
<p>This movie is another excellent example of <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing. What other way to pique the audience’s interest significantly and emphasize them than capture them in a freeze-frame.</p>
<h3 id="07Death-Proof"><a href="#07Death-Proof" class="headerlink" title="07Death Proof"></a>07<strong>Death Proof</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Death Proof"
                ></p>
<p>In this movie, the freeze-frame stays till the very end. It captures three women as they raise their hands-on celebration after successfully beating to death a psychopath who has been killing young women.</p>
<h3 id="08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid"><a href="#08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid" class="headerlink" title="08Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"></a>08<strong>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid"
                ></p>
<p>This movie follows two train robbers, Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, known as the ‘Sundance Kid.’ After conducting several robberies, they go on the run as the authorities pursue them. After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.</p>
<p>Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.</p>
<h3 id="09Good-Fellas"><a href="#09Good-Fellas" class="headerlink" title="09Good Fellas"></a>09<strong>Good Fellas</strong></h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Good fellas"
                ></p>
<p>Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in ‘Good Fellas’ to emphasize the movie plot.</p>
<p>In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> before uttering the lines, “As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster.”</p>
<p>This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.</p>
<h3 id="10Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban"><a href="#10Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban" class="headerlink" title="10Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"></a>10<strong>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Hardy Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban"
                ></p>
<p>During a bad and weird year at Hogwarts, Harry potter experiences an extremely joyous moment when he goes anti-gravity on his new Firebolt broom.</p>
<p>He becomes overjoyed and his expression gets captured in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="11The-Breakfast-Club"><a href="#11The-Breakfast-Club" class="headerlink" title="11The Breakfast Club"></a>11<strong>The Breakfast Club</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The Breakfast Club"
                ></p>
<p>The Breakfast Club is an 80s movie showing teenagers trying to find their identity in life and overcoming the challenges of these years.</p>
<p>This is another <strong>freeze frame example</strong> where the filmmakers showed great expertise. The character John Bender is caught in a <strong>freeze-frame,</strong> punching the air to celebrate his victory.</p>
<p>He has just shared a kiss with the class sweetheart Claire. He and his classmates have also just won over the authoritative principal, Mr. Vernon.</p>
<h3 id="12Pulp-Fiction-Pumpkin-and-Honey-Bunny"><a href="#12Pulp-Fiction-Pumpkin-and-Honey-Bunny" class="headerlink" title="12Pulp Fiction: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny."></a>12<strong>Pulp Fiction: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Pulp Fiction"
                ></p>
<p>Pulp Fiction is another movie such as ‘Good Fellas’ with its freeze-frame edition done at the movie’s beginning.</p>
<p>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are shown at the movie’s beginning, sitting together in a diner. They argue whether it will be safer to rub a bank or a restaurant. In the end, they settle for a diner — the same one they are sitting in.</p>
<p>They kiss and pull out their guns, and the images freeze before the credits roll out.</p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> gives us a sneak peek of the violence to experience in the movie, and indeed, we were not disappointed.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> At the beginning of a movie&#x2F;video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience’s interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This <strong>freeze-frame</strong> technique was used in the film ‘Good Fellas’ to pique the audience’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The ‘breakfast club’ filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.</p>

It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.</p>
<p>But several movie directors have effectively used the <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing technique that wowed the audience.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the best <strong>freeze frame examples</strong> you would love;</p>
<h3 id="01The-Departed-1"><a href="#01The-Departed-1" class="headerlink" title="01The Departed"></a>01<strong>The Departed</strong></h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.</p>
<p>He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.</p>
<h3 id="02Rocky-III-1"><a href="#02Rocky-III-1" class="headerlink" title="02Rocky III"></a>02<strong>Rocky III</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Rocky III"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.</p>
<p>During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.</p>
<p>The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, “Ding Dong.”</p>
<p>The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.</p>
<h3 id="03400-Blows-1"><a href="#03400-Blows-1" class="headerlink" title="03400 Blows"></a>03<strong>400 Blows</strong></h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.</p>
<p>In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.</p>
<p>He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.</p>

                      alt="Thelma and Louise"
                ></p>
<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>
<p>Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.</p>

                      alt="The wolf of wall street"
                ></p>
<p>Scorsese uses freeze-frame at the beginning of this movie, just as he did in Good Fellas. The freeze-frame effect here helps introduce the character and shows us the plot of the movie hence piquing the audience’s interests immediately.</p>
<h3 id="06Out-of-Sight-1"><a href="#06Out-of-Sight-1" class="headerlink" title="06Out of Sight"></a>06<strong>Out of Sight</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Out of Sight"
                ></p>
<p>This movie is another excellent example of <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing. What other way to pique the audience’s interest significantly and emphasize them than capture them in a freeze-frame.</p>
<h3 id="07Death-Proof-1"><a href="#07Death-Proof-1" class="headerlink" title="07Death Proof"></a>07<strong>Death Proof</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Death Proof"
                ></p>
<p>In this movie, the freeze-frame stays till the very end. It captures three women as they raise their hands-on celebration after successfully beating to death a psychopath who has been killing young women.</p>
<h3 id="08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-1"><a href="#08Butch-Cassidy-and-the-Sundance-Kid-1" class="headerlink" title="08Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"></a>08<strong>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid"
                ></p>
<p>This movie follows two train robbers, Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, known as the ‘Sundance Kid.’ After conducting several robberies, they go on the run as the authorities pursue them. After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.</p>
<p>Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.</p>
<h3 id="09Good-Fellas-1"><a href="#09Good-Fellas-1" class="headerlink" title="09Good Fellas"></a>09<strong>Good Fellas</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Good fellas"
                ></p>
<p>Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in ‘Good Fellas’ to emphasize the movie plot.</p>
<p>In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> before uttering the lines, “As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster.”</p>
<p>This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.</p>
<h3 id="10Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban-1"><a href="#10Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban-1" class="headerlink" title="10Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"></a>10<strong>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Hardy Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban"
                ></p>
<p>During a bad and weird year at Hogwarts, Harry potter experiences an extremely joyous moment when he goes anti-gravity on his new Firebolt broom.</p>
<p>He becomes overjoyed and his expression gets captured in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="11The-Breakfast-Club-1"><a href="#11The-Breakfast-Club-1" class="headerlink" title="11The Breakfast Club"></a>11<strong>The Breakfast Club</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="The Breakfast Club"
                ></p>
<p>The Breakfast Club is an 80s movie showing teenagers trying to find their identity in life and overcoming the challenges of these years.</p>
<p>This is another <strong>freeze frame example</strong> where the filmmakers showed great expertise. The character John Bender is caught in a <strong>freeze-frame,</strong> punching the air to celebrate his victory.</p>
<p>He has just shared a kiss with the class sweetheart Claire. He and his classmates have also just won over the authoritative principal, Mr. Vernon.</p>
<h3 id="12Pulp-Fiction-Pumpkin-and-Honey-Bunny-1"><a href="#12Pulp-Fiction-Pumpkin-and-Honey-Bunny-1" class="headerlink" title="12Pulp Fiction: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny."></a>12<strong>Pulp Fiction: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Pulp Fiction"
                ></p>
<p>Pulp Fiction is another movie such as ‘Good Fellas’ with its freeze-frame edition done at the movie’s beginning.</p>
<p>Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are shown at the movie’s beginning, sitting together in a diner. They argue whether it will be safer to rub a bank or a restaurant. In the end, they settle for a diner — the same one they are sitting in.</p>
<p>They kiss and pull out their guns, and the images freeze before the credits roll out.</p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> gives us a sneak peek of the violence to experience in the movie, and indeed, we were not disappointed.</p>

It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> At the beginning of a movie&#x2F;video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience’s interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This <strong>freeze-frame</strong> technique was used in the film ‘Good Fellas’ to pique the audience’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The ‘breakfast club’ filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie ‘The Departed.’</p>

It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.</p>
<p>But several movie directors have effectively used the <strong>freeze-frame</strong> video editing technique that wowed the audience.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the best <strong>freeze frame examples</strong> you would love;</p>
<h3 id="01The-Departed-3"><a href="#01The-Departed-3" class="headerlink" title="01The Departed"></a>01<strong>The Departed</strong></h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.</p>
<p>He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.</p>
<h3 id="02Rocky-III-3"><a href="#02Rocky-III-3" class="headerlink" title="02Rocky III"></a>02<strong>Rocky III</strong></h3><p><img

                      alt="Rocky III"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>freeze-frame</strong> came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.</p>
<p>During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.</p>
<p>The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, “Ding Dong.”</p>
<p>The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.</p>

<p>In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.</p>
<p>In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.</p>
<p>He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.</p>

                      alt="Thelma and Louise"
                ></p>
<p>Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.</p>
<p>While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.</p>
<p>Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a <strong>freeze-frame</strong> as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.</p>
<p>Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.</p>

Don’t worry because this guideline will provide you with the required information. These simple steps will let you add your favorite VHS look to your video using Premiere Pro.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import your video into Adobe Premiere Pro. Open the “Lumetri Color” panel by clicking “Color” in the main toolbar. Further, choose “Lumetri Scopes” to access the graph window. Then, adjust the basic settings in the “Lumetri Color” panel. Continue to decrease the value of “Whites,” increase the “Contrast,” and set the “Blacks” to 10 on the graph.</p>

                      alt="set lumetri color parameters"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Navigate to the “Creative” tab in the “Lumetri Color” panel. Increase the “Faded Film” and decrease the “Sharpness,” “Saturation,” and “Vibrance” to your liking. Use the color wheels in the “Color Wheels &amp; Match” section to give the right tone. Further, proceed to increase the “Vignette” value from the same tab.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change other lumetri parameters"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enable editing mode by selecting “Editing” in the main bar. Choose “Edit” from the lower section and search for the “Channel Blur” effect. Apply the effect by dragging and dropping it onto your video clip. Place the effect above previous adjustments and effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add channel blur effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the “Channel Blur” effect tab, enable “Repeat Edge Pixel” and increase “Red Blurriness” to 30. Repeat the same step but this time increase “Blue Blurriness” to 30 and “Red Blurriness” to 15 and change “Blur Dimensions” to “Vertical.”</p>

                      alt="change channel blur parameters"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Continue to add the “Unsharp Mask” and “Color Emboss” effects from the “Effect” tab. Proceed and change “Amount” and “Radius” for “Unsharp Mask” to 85 and 20, respectively. Slightly increase the “Relief” values for the “Color Emboss” effect.</p>

                      alt="add unsharp and color emboss"
                ></p>
<p>Proceed to apply the “Noise” effect from the “Noise &amp; Grain” section and further adjust the “Amount of Noise” to your preference. Induce the “Wave Warp” effect and set the parameters of “Wave Height” to 2 and “Wave Width” to 1000. Change “Direction” to 0 and “Pinning” to “Horizontal Edges.”</p>

                      alt="add noise and wave warp"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You can crop your video to a 4:3 aspect ratio to give your video more authenticity. To do this, create two “Color Matte” layers using the “New Item” icon. Name and place them over the video clip. Apply the “Crop” effect to both layers. Set the “Left” option to 86 for the first layer and the “Right” option to 86 for the second layer. Set the “Edge Feather” to 30 for both layers.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Make sure to save your VHS effect as a preset for future use by right-clicking and selecting “Save Preset.” Finally, export your <strong>VHS effect Premiere Pro</strong> video to your desired format.</p>

<li>B-roll</li>
</ol>
<p>B-roll is secondary video that is frequently used as cutaway video to add context and visual interest to your story. The term is originated from the early days of Hollywood when there used to be an A-roll which was the primary video and B-roll which served as a secondary video footage. This can help you visualize your video from different dimensions, giving it a more realistic look for captivating viewers.</p>

<li>Compression rate, bit depth, bit</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of data the camera records each second is referred to as bit rate. Every single second of a video is subject to significant data processing by cameras. The higher the quality of the video, the more is the bit rate. Bit depth refers to the number of colors your camera can read per pixel. Common bit depths are 8-bit and 10-bit, which enable a camera to read 256 million or 1.07 billion colors respectively. To upload your edited video, a compression is usually required to convert your resolution to internet quality so that the upload can be made simpler, without distorting the video resolution.</p>

When you take images or record sound, you frequently end up with distorted results due to lens distortion. In this article, we will discuss what lens distortion is, how it may be fixed, and the factors you need to pay attention to avoid lens distortion when taking or recording videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Basic-introduction-to-lens-distortion"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-introduction-to-lens-distortion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion"></a>Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion</h2><p><strong>1. What is lens distortion</strong></p>
<p>Distortion means that the straight rectilinear projection is not straight. In the pinhole camera model, lens distortion is measured by how far from the image’s ideal projection is. From a geometric optics point of view, the scene’s straight lines don’t look straight in the image.</p>
<p>When you take a picture, the camera lens can somehow change the shape of the image. It is called camera lens distortion. In simple terms, we can tell you that this is the case because distortion in-camera is when the lens makes curved lines in an image and doesn’t show the straight lines from the scene.</p>
<p><strong>2. What cause it</strong></p>
<p>Lens distortion happens with all lenses. It is because of several things, such as how the lens is curved, how far away the subject is, and the angle at which the photo was taken. Furthermore, it changes the image in many ways, but you can see it most when straight lines at the frame’s edges are no longer parallel.</p>
<p>Most geometric lens distortions happen when the focal distance is short (barrel distortion), long (pincushion distortion), or when a fish-eye lens is used to take a picture from a low angle (keystone distortion).</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-correct-a-distorted-lens"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-correct-a-distorted-lens" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?"></a>Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?</h2><p>A lot of times, with lower-end wide-angle lenses, especially action cams like GoPro, you get pretty gnarly distortion when you’re filming. As we know, the Earth is round, but it shouldn’t look like this when you take a picture. Indeed, it’s very distorted, it has the horizon line bending all over the place, and basically, all of the lines in the video have some level of curvature.</p>
<p>Hence, follow all the steps below to know how to fix it:</p>
<p>Step1 Import your video to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p>Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the “Camera model” based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="click on the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To adjust the distortion, you can slide the bar to the left or the right. If you slide the bar to the right (maximum level), there will be no adjustment. However, if you slide the bar to the left, you can see it pulling those lines as high up as possible.</p>
<p>You can see a bit of curvature, but it looks much more natural, and all of the lines in the video look so much better.</p>

Avoid very wide-angle lenses</strong></p>
<p>The more distortion there is in a lens, like a 15mm prime, the wider it is. Sometimes you need a very wide-angle lens, and distortion is unavoidable. If you have room to move back, you could try using a lens with a different focal length.</p>
<p><strong>2. Avoid getting too close</strong></p>
<p>Doing so will enhance optical distortion in many lenses and the likelihood of perspective distortion in all lenses.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be mindful of your composition</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous instances where distortion is acceptable or even intended. Others must be carefully examined, such as utilizing a wide-angle lens to photograph a row of people. When you get too close to a group, the distortion makes the people at each end appear considerably wider! Therefore, consider your composition. Stand back and add space around your group; if necessary, you can trim the image afterward.</p>
<p><strong>4. Use a 50mm lens</strong></p>
<p>50mm lenses are often called “all-purpose” lenses. There is a good reason</p>
<p>for this. A 50mm lens is great for portraits, street photography, and many other kinds of photography, including architecture. If your subject is big, you just need space to stand back. You will see that a 50mm lens rarely distorts the image.</p>

You can change momentum. You can slow it down and speed it up to convey a particular mood. In this article, you will learn how and when to control the speed of the video and its importance.</p>
<h2 id="Importance-of-Speeding-up-Slowing-Down-Your-video"><a href="#Importance-of-Speeding-up-Slowing-Down-Your-video" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Speeding up&#x2F;Slowing Down Your video?"></a>Importance of Speeding up&#x2F;Slowing Down Your video?</h2><p>Speeding up or slowing it down, known as slow or fast motion, can make your video faster or slower than its actual speed, called speed ramping. Overall, adjusting the speed of video clips can enhance the video’s visual effects, especially if you want to convey a particular mood to the audience. Speeding up your video may create a comical and dramatic impact, while slowing down your video can give viewers a time-lapse feel or an emotional mood.</p>
<p>This video speed controlling software can instantly speed up video up to 50x times. On the contrary, you can also slow down the video up to 0.1x, which means a one-minute video will run for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>How important is this Feature? The technique plays an essential role in adjusting the video’s speed. You will appreciate this technique once you’ve started editing your video. At first, controlling the speed of your video without music will give you a plain or bare impression. Based on my experience, I cannot quickly identify which video part needs to control the speed. Still, once you’ve added music at the start, you can quickly determine when and where you should maintain the momentum based on the beat of the music.</p>

<p><strong>Speed ramping</strong> - In Filmora, you can choose to change speed uniformly or speedily. To change the rate of the video or audio clip speed, you need to use the Filmora Speed Ramping feature.</p>
<p>In the Speed Ramping panel, you can customize the speed or select the speed preset such as Montage, Hero Moment, Bullet Time, Jumper, Flash in, and Flash out. You can choose the Preset speed ramps.</p>
<p>Evenly change the speed of the video clip to match another clip. Much software available will give you the option to speed ramp.</p>
<p>The importance of speed controls Having control over the speed of your motors and machinery is vital for you to get the full potential of your tools. Giving yourself complete speed control will ensure you experience little to no tool chatter and a perfect machined finish every time.</p>
<p>Playing with speed controls can help displeasure interest and guide focus when editing your video. You might have used slow motion to overemphasize a scene, or maybe you’ve sped up a clip to create a time-lapse—but have you tried to speed ramping?</p>

<p><strong>Speed ramping</strong> - In Filmora, you can choose to change speed uniformly or speedily. To change the rate of the video or audio clip speed, you need to use the Filmora Speed Ramping feature.</p>

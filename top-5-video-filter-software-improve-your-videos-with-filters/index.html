More Engaging Than Text or Images</h2><p>When you’re scrolling through your feed, what’s more, likely to stop you in your tracks: a picture or a video? For most people, the answer is video. In general, video is more engaging than image because it captures our attention more effectively and holds it for longer. Studies have shown that the human brain processes video 60,000 times faster than text, and that viewers retain 95% of a message when they watch it in a video, as opposed to 10% when they read it in text. Furthermore, video is more likely to evoke an emotional response than an image. We can’t help but be drawn in by the movement, sound, and facial expressions of the people in the video, which makes us more likely to feel connected to them. So next time you’re trying to capture someone’s attention, think about using video instead of a still image.</p>

Boost your SEO</h2><p>SEO is an acronym that stands for “search engine optimization.” It is a process of improving the visibility and ranking of a website or web page in search engine results pages (SERPs). The higher a website or web page appears in the SERPs, the more likely it is to be clicked by users.</p>
<p>If you’re like most people, you probably spend a good chunk of your day scrolling through social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And when you’re not scrolling through your feed, you’re probably watching videos. Whether it’s a funny cat video or a cooking tutorial, chances are you’ve watched a video online in the past 24 hours. What you may not realize is that videos can also be used to boost your SEO.</p>
<p>That’s right - by creating and posting engaging videos, you can attract more visitors to your website and improve your search engine ranking. Here’s how it works: when people watch your videos and share them with their friends, they are effectively giving your website a “vote” of approval. This helps to improve your visibility on search engines and attracts more visitors to your site. In addition, videos help to keep people on your website for longer periods of time, which is also a positive signal to search engines. So if you’re looking for a new way to improve your SEO, consider adding videos to your website. You might just be surprised at the results.</p>

Drive Traffic to Your Website</h2><p>Website traffic refers to the number of visitors who visit a website. This can be measured in a number of ways, including the number of unique visitors, the number of page views, and the amount of time spent on the site.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a way to give your website a boost, you may want to consider using videos. By posting engaging videos on social media sites, you can drive traffic to your site and increase your visibility.

<h2 id="5-Increase-Your-Social-Media-Reach-1"><a href="#5-Increase-Your-Social-Media-Reach-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Increase Your Social Media Reach"></a>5. Increase Your Social Media Reach</h2><p>Social media reach is the number of people who see your content. It’s the potential audience for your message. The more people who see it, the more likely it is that someone will engage with it. The size of your reach depends on the platform you’re using and how many followers you have. Some platforms, like Facebook, make it easy to reach a large audience.</p>
<p>The best way to increase your reach is to create compelling video content that people want to share. Videos are highly shareable, and if they are well-made and engaging, they can quickly attract a large audience. In addition, videos are a great way to build brand awareness and show potential customers what your business is all about. By including videos in your social media marketing strategy, you can reach a wider audience and create more opportunities for customer engagement.</p>

<h2 id="6-Boost-your-SEO-1"><a href="#6-Boost-your-SEO-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Boost your SEO"></a>6. Boost your SEO</h2><p>SEO is an acronym that stands for “search engine optimization.” It is a process of improving the visibility and ranking of a website or web page in search engine results pages (SERPs). The higher a website or web page appears in the SERPs, the more likely it is to be clicked by users.</p>
<p>If you’re like most people, you probably spend a good chunk of your day scrolling through social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And when you’re not scrolling through your feed, you’re probably watching videos. Whether it’s a funny cat video or a cooking tutorial, chances are you’ve watched a video online in the past 24 hours. What you may not realize is that videos can also be used to boost your SEO.</p>
<p>That’s right - by creating and posting engaging videos, you can attract more visitors to your website and improve your search engine ranking. Here’s how it works: when people watch your videos and share them with their friends, they are effectively giving your website a “vote” of approval. This helps to improve your visibility on search engines and attracts more visitors to your site. In addition, videos help to keep people on your website for longer periods of time, which is also a positive signal to search engines. So if you’re looking for a new way to improve your SEO, consider adding videos to your website. You might just be surprised at the results.</p>

<p>Can you imagine having shot a scene with impeccable attention to detail, but a small uncontrollable action leaves a portion of an unwanted cable or equipment in the frame? Bummer, right? But luckily, due to the power of video editing software, it is not hard to deal with such problems.</p>
<p>A way to work with such clips is to use the crop function while editing, as it can help emphasize or detract attention from a particular part of any video project.</p>
<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> While filming, try to capture footage in the highest resolution allowed by the available camera hardware; this will give you more room to play with while using the crop function.</p>
<p>To preface, CyberLink PowerDirector is a free video editing tool capable of accomplishing this and providing a professional touch to your video projects. And like other competing software, the program not only allows you to crop into clips but also uses keyframes to modify aspects like panning and zoom. So to help you perform this action, in this article, we list the steps you will need for cropping into video clips with PowerDirector. As an added bonus, we have also included the method to perform the same actions in WonderShare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X.</em></p>
<h2 id="How-to-Crop-Videos-with-CyberLink-PowerDirector"><a href="#How-to-Crop-Videos-with-CyberLink-PowerDirector" class="headerlink" title="How to Crop Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector?"></a>How to Crop Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector?</h2><p>The idea of cropping into clips has always been an easy action to perform; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><em>If you do not already have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FIN.html"><em>Cyberlink’s official website</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 by choosing Full Mode.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p>This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
<p>The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.</p>
<p>We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.</p>

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p>This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
<p>The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.</p>
<p>We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.</p>

<p>An emphasis on quick accessibility is present with Filmora, and we believe this is a huge plus for beginning creators. The use of iconography resemblant to mobile software is another aspect that helps increase familiarity.</p>
<p><em>If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website.</em></p>
<p>Now, to help you learn how to use the Crop Tool and to show you an example of what we mean, here is how you can use the feature Wondershare Filmora to get the desired output.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Once you have the software open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the Media File into your Video Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the clip onto the Timeline and then select it to activate further interactions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the Crop Options (marked in Red) to open the Crop window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick any edge within the visible box and resize them to select the portion you want to keep in the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p>Having read this bit of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more convenient due to the easier access it provides to the crop function.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-2"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-2" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>So, at the end of the day, both software listed in this article are fully functional and highly-capable video editing tools, but saving time spent in front of the computer is a huge factor for any video editor.</p>
<p>And Wondershare Filmora does just that with its modern iconography and increased accessibility. With its thoughtful, less-frills approach, Filmora is the one to pick if you do not want to be bogged down by needless menus and have to hunt for actions that will help you create a video that you would want to watch yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.</p>

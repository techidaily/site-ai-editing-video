How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.</p>
<p>Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.</p>
<p>You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Whip-Your-Camera"><a href="#Whip-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Whip Your Camera"></a>Whip Your Camera</h2><p>You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a stepwise guide for you to try</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.</li>
<li>Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.</li>
<li>For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.</li>
<li>Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.</li>
<li>Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.</p>
<p>The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="Fill-The-Frame"><a href="#Fill-The-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill The Frame"></a>Fill The Frame</h2><p>In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.</p>
<p>Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan the two shots you are going to take.</li>
<li>Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.</li>
<li>In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.</li>
<li>The second shot will take place at another time or place.</li>
<li>To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.</li>
<li>Import both shots into <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.</li>

<p>One important thing is to match the color and brightness of the object or subject. It will provide you with much better results. The video attached below explains all the steps of filling the frame.</p>

<h2 id="Match-Cut"><a href="#Match-Cut" class="headerlink" title="Match Cut"></a>Match Cut</h2><p>In a video, a match cut transitions from one shot to another. During this, the composition of the two shots is matched by action, subject, and subject matter. The goal is to make a visual match between two situations that don’t have a direct link. Here are the steps to creating a match-cut transition in your videos.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan the shot you are going to take.</li>
<li>Record the action in the first shot, for example, clapping your hands.</li>
<li>Go to another place or scene to record the second shot.</li>
<li>Repeat the same action in the second shot.</li>
<li>Import both camera shots to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Cut one shot to another when the action is at its peak.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, you can smoothly transition from one place or scene to another. There is a video attached below for a better understanding of the steps.</p>

A lot of thought is involved in creating a brand video, but most importantly, you need a high-quality video editor to refine your video and make it more fun, entertaining, and innovative - A video editor like Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>And that’s what this article is about - How to use the various basic and advanced editing tools in Filmora to create a brand video that makes a difference!</p>
<p>But first, let’s have a look at…</p>
<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video"></a>Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video</h2><p>What’s so special about it, you ask?</p>
<p>For starters, it fits right into the criteria we mentioned above. It’s innovative, entertaining, vibrant, and fun and showcases all the features of Filmora 11.</p>
<p>Here, see for yourself…</p>
<p>From all the new effects to the AR sticker themes and other video editing features like speed ramping, masking, and green screen effect, the video successfully lets the audience know how creative they can get with Filmora.</p>
<p>But did you see that they didn’t put the features out there just like that! They actually used all the basic and advanced video editing features in the video to give us an idea of what it looks like when put in action.</p>
<p>And the video quality, the content, and the flow of the video speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, I watched the video all the way to the end without getting bored for even a single second. And, being a video editor, I might as well get Filmora 11 after watching the highly compelling video!</p>
<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording"><a href="#3-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing"><a href="#5-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>
<h3 id="Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora at a Glance"></a>Wondershare Filmora at a Glance</h3><p><img

<p>Wondershare Filmora has plenty of basic and advanced video editing features to add that wow factor to your video. It can turn a plain boring video into something fun, exciting, and watch-worthy.</p>
<p>For example, the motion tracking feature lets you add an object that follows a certain movement in the video. Then we have the AR stickers that help enhance emotions and add personality to your video. Also, the green screen feature lets you add amazing background to your video to give the desired effect.</p>
<p>Filmora also has many video effects, templates, speed ramping, masking, auto beat sync, voice recording, and other features that can really take your brand video to the next level.</p>
<p>I’m sure you now have the hang of how to make a brand video that makes your business pop. But, you still might be confused about how to make the most of these features using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some helpful tips on using these features to make an effective brand video that creates brand awareness and drives sales!</p>

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>

<p>And that’s what this article is about - How to use the various basic and advanced editing tools in Filmora to create a brand video that makes a difference!</p>
<p>But first, let’s have a look at…</p>
<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video"></a>Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video</h2><p>What’s so special about it, you ask?</p>

<p>But did you see that they didn’t put the features out there just like that! They actually used all the basic and advanced video editing features in the video to give us an idea of what it looks like when put in action.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-1"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-1"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting-1"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording-1"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-1"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing-1"><a href="#5-Video-Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>
<h3 id="Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora at a Glance"></a>Wondershare Filmora at a Glance</h3><p><img

<p>Therefore, here are some helpful tips on using these features to make an effective brand video that creates brand awareness and drives sales!</p>

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-1"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-1"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-1"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-1"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-Up-1"><a href="#Wrapping-Up-1" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Shooting a brand video is easy, and it’s even easier to edit it. All you need is to let your creativity flow!</p>

<p>Here, see for yourself…</p>
<p>From all the new effects to the AR sticker themes and other video editing features like speed ramping, masking, and green screen effect, the video successfully lets the audience know how creative they can get with Filmora.</p>
<p>But did you see that they didn’t put the features out there just like that! They actually used all the basic and advanced video editing features in the video to give us an idea of what it looks like when put in action.</p>
<p>And the video quality, the content, and the flow of the video speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, I watched the video all the way to the end without getting bored for even a single second. And, being a video editor, I might as well get Filmora 11 after watching the highly compelling video!</p>
<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-2"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-2"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting-2"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording-2"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-2"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing-2"><a href="#5-Video-Editing-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>
<h3 id="Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora at a Glance"></a>Wondershare Filmora at a Glance</h3><p><img

<p>Filmora also has many video effects, templates, speed ramping, masking, auto beat sync, voice recording, and other features that can really take your brand video to the next level.</p>

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-2"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-2"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-2"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-2"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-2"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-Up-2"><a href="#Wrapping-Up-2" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Shooting a brand video is easy, and it’s even easier to edit it. All you need is to let your creativity flow!</p>

<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting-3"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording-3"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-3"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing-3"><a href="#5-Video-Editing-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-3"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-3"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-3"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-3"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-Up-3"><a href="#Wrapping-Up-3" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Shooting a brand video is easy, and it’s even easier to edit it. All you need is to let your creativity flow!</p>

Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film</h2><p>Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the <strong>call of duty montage</strong>.</p>
<p>In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.</p>
<p>Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie “Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual&#x2F;metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).</p>
<h3 id="3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times"><a href="#3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times" class="headerlink" title="3 Top Montages in Film for All Times"></a>3 Top Montages in Film for All Times</h3><p>If the above two examples did not fully express <strong>what is a montage video</strong>, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.</p>
<p><strong>1. Rocky (1976)</strong></p>
<p>One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer “Rocky”. The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots’ full training progression process.</p>
<p>To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character’s passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mulan (1998)</strong></p>
<p>Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.</p>
<p>Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character’s struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.</p>
<p>Watch this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX5zkYnGB0" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get an idea of how music and visuals can partner for tonal video montages.</p>
<p><strong>3. Creed (2015)</strong></p>
<p>Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.</p>
<p>Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky’s health deterioration against Creed’s training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.</p>

Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media"></a>Part 2. Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media</h2><p>Of course, movies and TV shows are the only types of media where video montage techniques are useful. Many non-professionals use options like a <strong>fortnite montage editor</strong> to create and edit montage videos for other projects they can share across platforms. Some even create video montages to create videos for social media.</p>
<p>These include vlog-like videos that people record and then edit together into a montage which different techniques. Plus, some users create montages of different things that interest them, like gameplay. Then, they share those videos across social media for views, like on TikTok or YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="·-Gaming-Montages"><a href="#·-Gaming-Montages" class="headerlink" title="· Gaming Montages"></a>· Gaming Montages</h3><p>Different creators focus on developing <strong>gaming montage</strong>s to create projects for the games they operate. These can include videos showcasing the skills or gameplays of the creation, all explaining a specific theme in some cases.</p>

<p>Part 1. Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film</p>
<p>Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the <strong>call of duty montage</strong>.</p>
<p>In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.</p>
<p>Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie “Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual&#x2F;metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).</p>
<h3 id="3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times-1"><a href="#3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times-1" class="headerlink" title="3 Top Montages in Film for All Times"></a>3 Top Montages in Film for All Times</h3><p>If the above two examples did not fully express <strong>what is a montage video</strong>, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.</p>
<p><strong>1. Rocky (1976)</strong></p>
<p>One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer “Rocky”. The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots’ full training progression process.</p>
<p>To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character’s passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mulan (1998)</strong></p>
<p>Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.</p>
<p>Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character’s struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.</p>

<p><strong>3. Creed (2015)</strong></p>
<p>Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.</p>
<p>Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky’s health deterioration against Creed’s training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.</p>

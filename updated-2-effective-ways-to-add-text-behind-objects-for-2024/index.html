<ul>
<li>You have to start by importing your video in the import library.</li>
<li>From the import library, you can click on the video and drag it down below to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-3.png"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile"><a href="#Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add the Text Tile"></a>Step3 Add the Text Tile</h5><p>It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> icon on the bar above the import library.</li>
<li>A drop-down option will be available on the left side.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.</li>
<li>You can choose anyone you like.</li>
<li>The most commonly used tile is the <strong>Basic 6</strong>.</li>
<li>When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.</li>
<li>To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png"
                      alt="choose the text tile"

<h5 id="Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile"><a href="#Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Edit the Text Tile"></a>Step4 Edit the Text Tile</h5><p>After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as “<strong>Hello, World.</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.</li>
<li>After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png"
                      alt="edit the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.</li>
<li>Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.</li>
<li>Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move on to animate the text tile.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>
<li>Now scroll down to where you will see the <strong>Right Roll</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Right Roll</strong> and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner of the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png"
                      alt="animate the text"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png"
                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png"
                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png"
                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png"
                      alt="change the position of the mask by dragging x"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>

<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add the Text Tile"></a>Step3 Add the Text Tile</h5><p>It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> icon on the bar above the import library.</li>
<li>A drop-down option will be available on the left side.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.</li>
<li>You can choose anyone you like.</li>
<li>The most commonly used tile is the <strong>Basic 6</strong>.</li>
<li>When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.</li>
<li>To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as “<strong>Hello, World.</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.</li>
<li>After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<li>Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.</li>
<li>Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move on to animate the text tile.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile-1"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>
<li>Now scroll down to where you will see the <strong>Right Roll</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Right Roll</strong> and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner of the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object-1"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png"
                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the position of the mask by dragging x"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>

<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>

                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>It supports the following formats: AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, MOV, FLV and 3GP.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is different than most video editors in that it does not use timelines. Instead, the user edits clips in a storyboard and adds effects and titles to them. It also has an Audio Visualization feature that plays back music in your collection and shows what you’re listening to in real time.

With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective"><a href="#Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective"></a>Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective</h5><p>Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.</p>

But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.</p>

This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.</p>

You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.</p>

<p>Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency’s creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.</p>

Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.</p>
<p>Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.</p>

<h5 id="Step-7-Dive-Into-the-Process"><a href="#Step-7-Dive-Into-the-Process" class="headerlink" title="Step 7 Dive Into the Process"></a>Step 7 Dive Into the Process</h5><p>You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.</p>
<p>Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.</p>

<h5 id="Step-8-Focus-on-Communication"><a href="#Step-8-Focus-on-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Step 8 Focus on Communication"></a>Step 8 Focus on Communication</h5><p>Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the <strong>video marketing company</strong>. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.</p>
<p>Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.</p>

It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.</p>
<p>You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.</p>

The software attempts to guide you at every step of the slideshow creation process with on screen pop-ups that contain tips and tricks for a hassle free working experience with the program. Working with the program, you are allowed to use the vast library of categorized premade templates for creating manual masterpieces of slideshow presentations.</p>
<p>Talking of customization features, you can choose to add images to the presentation, both from your device gallery, or through a Facebook import. The program library has a decent set of 48 transition and 58 image effects to amplify the appearance of the added photos. You can work to modify the image size to a screen fit to ward off blank spaces at the sides.</p>
<p>The slides can further be supplemented with premade music, GIFs and customizable text annotations. The software however, demands an account creation to address slideshow export needs to different media sharing platforms, like, Facebook, YouTube, DVD burning, etc.</p>

The rule states that the perfect slideshow presentation consists of a maximum of 10 slides, has a run time of approximately 20 minutes and has minimum font size of 30 points.</p>
<h3 id="02What-is-the-6-x-6-bullet-rule-of-slideshow-presentations-3"><a href="#02What-is-the-6-x-6-bullet-rule-of-slideshow-presentations-3" class="headerlink" title="02What is the 6 x 6 bullet rule of slideshow presentations?"></a>02What is the 6 x 6 bullet rule of slideshow presentations?</h3><p>The 6 x 6 bullet point rule states that you should include a maximum of 6 bullet points within each slide, along with limiting the bullet description to 6 words at the most. Abiding by this rule, your presentations slides will never look cluttered, while you can convey the desired information in a precise manner.</p>
<h3 id="03Why-should-the-presentation-slides-have-a-limited-amount-of-text-3"><a href="#03Why-should-the-presentation-slides-have-a-limited-amount-of-text-3" class="headerlink" title="03Why should the presentation slides have a limited amount of text?"></a>03Why should the presentation slides have a limited amount of text?</h3><p>Creating a crowded slideshow with a bundled text annotations are a downside to audience interests.

To get an appreciable response from the audience, you should aim at coming directly at the point, instead of beating about the bush. In an otherwise case of longer lengths, you may end up distracting your audience.</p>
<h3 id="05What-is-the-affordable-word-limit-of-each-slide-within-a-presentation-3"><a href="#05What-is-the-affordable-word-limit-of-each-slide-within-a-presentation-3" class="headerlink" title="05What is the affordable word limit of each slide within a presentation?"></a>05What is the affordable word limit of each slide within a presentation?</h3><p>To ensure a decent and professional look of your slideshow, restrict the latter’s text content to a maximum of 30 words within 6 to 8 lines. Add precise bullet points and avoid including lengthy paragraphs to create an engaging impact on the audience, instead of forcing them to read the presentation content as if it were a news article.</p>

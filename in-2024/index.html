<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>

<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>
<p>5. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Examples-of-Augmented-Reality-AR-In-Marketing"><a href="#Part-3-Examples-of-Augmented-Reality-AR-In-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing"></a>Part 3 <strong>Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing</strong></h2><p>Having discussed enough about the fundamental aspects of augmented reality, let us proceed towards understanding the credibility of <strong>augmented video</strong> in the light of modern day information centered applications. While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-1"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-1" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

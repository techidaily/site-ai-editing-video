It extends to the usage of photos and the creation of photo collages using these photos. Microsoft Word has the right features which you can easily use to organize pictures and photos in a certain way to make a photo collage. The <strong>collage maker Microsoft</strong> is not a hard operation to access if one knows the various options and operations of Microsoft Word well. There are different versions of Microsoft Word, all of which serve the same purposes but have different options and different icons representing various features. No matter which version you are using, the primary process of creating remains the same in all of those processes as it is simply the collection of the desired pictures, deciding on a particular shape and dimension of the page where you will arrange the pictures, inserting the pictures into the page, and then arranging them in a certain order.</p>
<p>Up until now, Microsoft has launched more than ten versions of Microsoft Word, with the preliminary ones being named “Microsoft Office”. In recent times, the newer version of Microsoft Word has become more user-friendly and thus it has become easier to perform so-called more complex tasks with the software, such as the creation of photo collages. With the addition of options and features to each newer version of Microsoft Word, it has become easier to work with graphics and arrange them or resize them or edit them in the desired way. More templates have been included in the newer versions to make it easy for the users to come to a decision when it comes to the shape of the collage and the number of pictures in it. Thus, it has various <strong>collage Microsoft Word</strong> options available now, which make the job much easier. There are a variety of options that are offered by the newer versions of Microsoft Word which will surely greatly help the user in creating photo collages as they open up the path to more features.</p>

                      alt="design tab ms word"
                ></p>
<p>The difference has been in the quality and the quantity of the features that each of the new versions of Microsoft Word contains. For example, the older versions were predominantly used for text, and thus, there were not any viable options for pictures and arranging them, and creating a collage. The newer versions of Microsoft Word have sections and options entirely dedicated to the creation of collages and thus contain special <strong>Microsoft collage maker</strong> options which make it much easier to arrange pictures in certain ways and create collages. For example, the newer versions consist of features such as ‘SmartArt” which is a built-in feature to create collages in Microsoft Word. It is available in the newer versions of Word. ‘SmartArt” works as a <strong>Microsoft auto collage</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The 2013 and 2016 versions of Microsoft Word also contain something called the ‘Developer” option, which can be accessed from the ‘Customizing the Ribbon” section. You can use it to specify the number of pictures and then insert pictures from a file. There is also the option of using Word Tables which can be used in any version of Microsoft Word to create a certain arrangement for your photo collage. Word Tables give the user complete control over the layout of the collage and this makes it easier for the user to arrange the pictures of the collage.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers a way of describing the world</strong></p>
<p>For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.</p>

<p>Though it is based on colours, they learn the process of classification and sorting, which then gets applied to the other factors in life.</p>

<p>The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures. That is commonly reflected through the traffic lights, where we stop at red colour, get ready to move in the colour tallow and the green colour gives us the signal to move or the message of being out of danger.</p>
<p>Also, the colour blue indicates paleness or bruises in the skin. The colour red indicates rashes or blood. So, the knowledge of colour helps the children learn about safety and health.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about association</strong></p>

If a child is unable to understand that the colour red is associated with danger, green is associated with safety and the like; then the knowledge will be of no use.</p>
<p>So, when the child learns about colours and connects them to the different safety and health measures, they automatically learn how to associate one thing with another. This process is crucial and will benefit them throughout their lives.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The following list points out the importance of learning colours for children.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Integrates basic knowledge</strong></p>
<p>Knowing about the different colours is the basic and the most initial information that every child must have. We need colours in every instance of our lives. Therefore, it is vital for the children to learn about them from the initial stages of their lives.</p>
<p>So, learning about the colours integrates the basic knowledge of colours in their minds which is to stay with them throughout their lives and utilize them as and when the necessity arises.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers them a means for verbal communication</strong></p>
<p>When a child learns about colours, they attain a way to describe the world around them. Therefore, it helps in enhancing their method of communication. As a result, it also nurtures and improves their verbal skills to a large extent.</p>
<p>When they know about the colours, it inaugurates a novel hallway of set communicating and knowing about the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers a way of describing the world</strong></p>
<p>For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.</p>
<p>So, when they learn about colours, they tend to find a way to describe the environment. It gives them a better understanding of the world and their surrounding as they learn about the colours.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning to classify and sort</strong></p>
<p>When a child learns about colours, they tend to learn about sorting things and classifying the different objects based on colours. For example, they might be able to separate blue balloons from the red ones from a bunch of balloons in front of them.</p>
<p>Though it is based on colours, they learn the process of classification and sorting, which then gets applied to the other factors in life.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning about safety and health through colours</strong></p>
<p>The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures. That is commonly reflected through the traffic lights, where we stop at red colour, get ready to move in the colour tallow and the green colour gives us the signal to move or the message of being out of danger.</p>
<p>Also, the colour blue indicates paleness or bruises in the skin. The colour red indicates rashes or blood. So, the knowledge of colour helps the children learn about safety and health.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about association</strong></p>
<p>The above point of learning about health and safety with the help of colours includes learning another important aspect in life, which is association. If a child is unable to understand that the colour red is associated with danger, green is associated with safety and the like; then the knowledge will be of no use.</p>
<p>So, when the child learns about colours and connects them to the different safety and health measures, they automatically learn how to associate one thing with another. This process is crucial and will benefit them throughout their lives.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about letters</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, as the child learns about colours, they would spell them as well. So, as a result, they will learn how to spell different colours. That will be a way to practice spelling, and this will result in them learning about letters and words a lot more efficiently and excitingly.</p>

<p>When they know about the colours, it inaugurates a novel hallway of set communicating and knowing about the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers a way of describing the world</strong></p>
<p>For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.</p>
<p>So, when they learn about colours, they tend to find a way to describe the environment. It gives them a better understanding of the world and their surrounding as they learn about the colours.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning to classify and sort</strong></p>

<p>Though it is based on colours, they learn the process of classification and sorting, which then gets applied to the other factors in life.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning about safety and health through colours</strong></p>
<p>The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures. That is commonly reflected through the traffic lights, where we stop at red colour, get ready to move in the colour tallow and the green colour gives us the signal to move or the message of being out of danger.</p>
<p>Also, the colour blue indicates paleness or bruises in the skin. The colour red indicates rashes or blood. So, the knowledge of colour helps the children learn about safety and health.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about association</strong></p>
<p>The above point of learning about health and safety with the help of colours includes learning another important aspect in life, which is association. If a child is unable to understand that the colour red is associated with danger, green is associated with safety and the like; then the knowledge will be of no use.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about letters</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, as the child learns about colours, they would spell them as well. So, as a result, they will learn how to spell different colours. That will be a way to practice spelling, and this will result in them learning about letters and words a lot more efficiently and excitingly.</p>

Internet users post thousands of videos every day that you can watch online or download and rewatch in your free time. Suppose you encounter a video that is upside down or shot at an angle that makes it difficult for you to enjoy it fully.</p>
<p>It would be nice to find a way to rotate the video to portrait mode so you can watch it without any distractions. Fortunately, this article will discuss using Media Player Classic to rotate any video. We also discuss an excellent alternative to the aforementioned media player.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Media-Player-Classic"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Player-Classic" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Player Classic?"></a>What Is Media Player Classic?</h2><p>In a nutshell, Media Player Classic is an open-source media player suitable for 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows. If you have used the original interface, you might notice that it resembles Windows Media Player 6.4. The only key difference is that the former is more feature-rich and provides more options. In addition, Media Player Classic is very compact and lightweight.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="media player classic interface"
                ></p>
<p>A programmer named “Gabest’’ created and designed this platform as a closed-source application. Things changed, and he later relicensed the media player as free under the terms of the GLP-2.0 license. He released the final version, MPC 6.4.9.0, on 20th March 2006.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, development stalled in 2006, much to the disappointment of many users who had grown to love it. Gabest made a public statement in 2007 saying that Media Player Classic was not dead, just that he couldn’t work on it anymore.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Rotate-Video-in-Media-Player-Classic"><a href="#How-To-Rotate-Video-in-Media-Player-Classic" class="headerlink" title="How To Rotate Video in Media Player Classic?"></a>How To Rotate Video in Media Player Classic?</h2><p>Media Player Classic allows you to rotate your video around three axes, X, Y, and Z. Once you are done, you can fix a video that was initially upside down or in landscape mode for a better viewing experience. Another perk of using Media Player Classic to rotate a video is that you can use shortcuts to make your work easier.</p>
<p>Before we teach you how to rotate video in windows Media Player Classic, there are a few things you should know. Unfortunately, this platform doesn’t allow you to rotate a video in its graphical user interface. You can’t also use it to edit a video. Suppose you want to add text or overwrite the original video clip. Media Player Classic can only allow you to playback a video or rotate it.</p>
<p>Here is a simple guide on how to rotate videos in Media Player Classic.</p>
<p>Step1 Launch Media Player Classic and click on the “View” tab. Select “Options” or click “O” to display the “Options” window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-options.jpg"
                      alt="options in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Navigate to the left pane to the Player Group and click on “Keys.” If the Player Group is not expanded by the time, you launch the platform, double-click it and wait a few seconds. You can then navigate to the “PnS Rotate” command on the Keys list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-keys.jpg"
                      alt="keys in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Go to the “PnS Rotate+” command and double-click the “Key” field. You can then click on any key to rotate your video around the x-axis. Once you are satisfied with the results, click “…” to apply the changes you have made.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-pns-rotate.jpg"
                      alt="pns rotate in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 You can now assign shortcuts to “PnS Rotate” commands. For instance, you could assign PnS Rotate Y for rotation along the Y axis and PnS Z for rotation along the Z axis. After each axis has a shortcut, select “Apply” then “OK” to save your changes and close the Options window respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-apply.jpg"
                      alt="apply rotate in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Select “Output” on the Options window and navigate to the DirectShow Video section to confirm whether the Media Classic Player supports rotation for the rendered video. Ascertain the Rotation feature has a green check mark, which indicates that the platform promotes rotation for the video. If the video has a red X, select “Apply” and click “OK.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="output rotation in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Use the shortcuts you assigned to the keys in Step 4 to rotate your video as you see fit. Since the rotation occurs gradually, you might need to press the keys numerous times or press and hold to see a visible change.</p>
<p>For instance, you can rotate your video from landscape to portrait by clicking “Alt-Num 1” and “Alt-Num 3,” respectively. To revert your video to its original state, press “Alt-Num 5.”</p>

<p>As you have seen, Media player Classic doesn’t have the Rotate feature per se. However, you can assign shortcuts to the keys to rotate a video along three axes as you see fit. You can also use a combination of keys like Alt and Num to change how your video sits so you can enjoy it as you like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wondershare Filmora has a more comprehensive Rotate feature that allows you to drag your pointer along a bar till the video sits at the correct number of degrees.</p>
<p>This platform also provides additional features, like allowing you to scale the video to fit the screen and adjusting project settings like the resolution and frame rate. If you don’t want to use the sliding bar, you can use your pointer to manually adjust the rotation by clicking on the pivot with your pointer.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Windows Media Player is the ideal choice if you want to rotate your video and leave it at that. However, if you are looking for more advanced features, you are better off choosing Wondershare Filmora.

<p>As you have seen, Media player Classic doesn’t have the Rotate feature per se. However, you can assign shortcuts to the keys to rotate a video along three axes as you see fit. You can also use a combination of keys like Alt and Num to change how your video sits so you can enjoy it as you like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wondershare Filmora has a more comprehensive Rotate feature that allows you to drag your pointer along a bar till the video sits at the correct number of degrees.</p>
<p>This platform also provides additional features, like allowing you to scale the video to fit the screen and adjusting project settings like the resolution and frame rate. If you don’t want to use the sliding bar, you can use your pointer to manually adjust the rotation by clicking on the pivot with your pointer.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Windows Media Player is the ideal choice if you want to rotate your video and leave it at that. However, if you are looking for more advanced features, you are better off choosing Wondershare Filmora. The latter option also makes your videos look more polished like they were edited by a professional.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Videos might be trickier to edit than photos, especially when you want to rotate them. Fortunately, developers have been working tirelessly to ensure you have many tools at your disposal to edit your videos from any device at any time.</p>
<p>If you don’t fancy editing videos on your laptop, you could download the software to your smartphone and rotate videos on the move. Technology is truly a blessing that has come to make our work easier. Hopefully, after reading this article, you can effortlessly rotate any video you encounter.</p>

While that is an entirely unscientific assessment that you should not cite in a college paper, given the accessibility and sophistication of today’s green screen technology, it is probably not far off. Everyone has access to expert compositing technology, from Marvel movies to local news stations.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE GREEN SCREEN AND CHROMA KEYING?</strong></p>
<p>The colored background you want to make transparent and remove from your shot is referred to as a green screen. This is typically a single-colored backdrop, which can be any color but is usually bright green because it is the color most dissimilar to human skin tones. (Blue screens were commonly used in the early days of film, and they may still be used in some cases.)</p>
<p>The chroma key is a time-honored and widely used visual effects technique. Simply stated, chroma key is the process of photographing a subject against a solid-color background and then removing that background in post-production and replacing it with transparency. The subject can then be positioned in front of any new background.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video"><a href="#1-Record-your-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg"
                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Set-the-key"><a href="#3-Set-the-key" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

<h2 id="4-Tweak-and-export"><a href="#4-Tweak-and-export" class="headerlink" title="4. Tweak and export"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Tweak and export</strong></h2><p>Once you’re happy, you can use Lightworks’ other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-1"><a href="#Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 – Clean the edges"></a><strong>Step 3 – Clean the edges</strong></h4><p>As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-1"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg"
                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-1"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Set-the-key-1"><a href="#3-Set-the-key-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

<h2 id="4-Tweak-and-export-1"><a href="#4-Tweak-and-export-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Tweak and export"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Tweak and export</strong></h2><p>Once you’re happy, you can use Lightworks’ other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-2"><a href="#Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 – Clean the edges"></a><strong>Step 3 – Clean the edges</strong></h4><p>As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-2"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg"
                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-2"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Set-the-key-2"><a href="#3-Set-the-key-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

<h2 id="4-Tweak-and-export-2"><a href="#4-Tweak-and-export-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Tweak and export"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Tweak and export</strong></h2><p>Once you’re happy, you can use Lightworks’ other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-3"><a href="#Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 – Clean the edges"></a><strong>Step 3 – Clean the edges</strong></h4><p>As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-3"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg"
                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-3"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Set-the-key-3"><a href="#3-Set-the-key-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

<h2 id="4-Tweak-and-export-3"><a href="#4-Tweak-and-export-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Tweak and export"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Tweak and export</strong></h2><p>Once you’re happy, you can use Lightworks’ other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>This effect may be used for a number of reasons, including clip transitions, speeding up a clip to make it shorter, and slowing down a clip to make it longer. Speed ramping may be used with a number of various effects.</p>
<p>According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The ability to alter the speed of individual clips is one of Premiere Pro’s most important capabilities. While speed ramping is often used in sports highlights, changing the speed of video may be useful for a number of other types of material.</p>
<p>You’ll learn how to construct a spectacular speed ramp in Adobe Premiere Pro, beginning with capturing the proper kind of video and moving to advanced tips and methods. Following that, we’ll go through some ideas and inspiration for when to use a speed ramp in your circumstance.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#What-is-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="What is Speed Ramping?"></a>What is Speed Ramping?</h2><p>A speed ramp is used to gradually increase the speed of a video clip as it accelerates or decelerates. It is guaranteed that a smooth transition between two separate speeds will take place. The method is crucial in changing the tempo of the film and, as a consequence, creating a dramatic impression. The film’s required velocity is achieved by the employment of super-fast visual effects.</p>
<p>A speed ramp, as opposed to a rapid shift in speed, provides for a more smooth transition between two drastically differing speeds. This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.</p>
<h3 id="Examples-of-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#Examples-of-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Speed Ramping"></a>Examples of Speed Ramping</h3><p>It works especially well when utilized to focus the viewer’s attention on a certain moment or action in your videos, such as a tough jump or an impending bullet. Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.</p>
<p>You may also use Speed Ramping to alter the runtime of your video to fit the time limits of other social media sites, such as Instagram and Vine. If you just have 30 seconds to deliver your video, the following are the two most common places where people apply speed ramping techniques:</p>
<p>Assume you are shooting a person walking and want the clip to play in slow motion so that viewers can clearly see the person’s face. In this scenario, speed ramping is precisely what you need since it enables you to do precisely that.</p>
<p>Do you remember the famous movie “The Matrix” scene, when Neo dodges the bullets? It’s not some typical scene; it’s a pretty good example of speed ramping.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>

<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>

<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-1"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-1" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-1"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-1" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-1"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>

<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-2"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-2" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-2"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-2" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<h2 id="What-is-Speed-Ramping-3"><a href="#What-is-Speed-Ramping-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Speed Ramping?"></a>What is Speed Ramping?</h2><p>A speed ramp is used to gradually increase the speed of a video clip as it accelerates or decelerates. It is guaranteed that a smooth transition between two separate speeds will take place. The method is crucial in changing the tempo of the film and, as a consequence, creating a dramatic impression. The film’s required velocity is achieved by the employment of super-fast visual effects.</p>
<p>A speed ramp, as opposed to a rapid shift in speed, provides for a more smooth transition between two drastically differing speeds. This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.</p>
<h3 id="Examples-of-Speed-Ramping-3"><a href="#Examples-of-Speed-Ramping-3" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Speed Ramping"></a>Examples of Speed Ramping</h3><p>It works especially well when utilized to focus the viewer’s attention on a certain moment or action in your videos, such as a tough jump or an impending bullet. Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.</p>
<p>You may also use Speed Ramping to alter the runtime of your video to fit the time limits of other social media sites, such as Instagram and Vine. If you just have 30 seconds to deliver your video, the following are the two most common places where people apply speed ramping techniques:</p>
<p>Assume you are shooting a person walking and want the clip to play in slow motion so that viewers can clearly see the person’s face. In this scenario, speed ramping is precisely what you need since it enables you to do precisely that.</p>
<p>Do you remember the famous movie “The Matrix” scene, when Neo dodges the bullets? It’s not some typical scene; it’s a pretty good example of speed ramping.</p>

<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-3"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-3" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-3"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-3" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color grading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color grading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-5"><a href="#In-this-article-5" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-1"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-1" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-1"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-1"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-1"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-1"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-1"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-1"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>

<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-3"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-3" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-3"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-3"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-3"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-3"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-3"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5.

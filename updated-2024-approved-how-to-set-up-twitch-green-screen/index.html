With Twitch green screen background, you can easily configure Chroma key settings and detect your green screen with a single click.</p>
<p>The twitch green screen attaches directly to the back of your chair. You don’t have to worry about stands, or spacing behind your chair. Just attach it and go. This portable green screen can fit on the back of your chair a feature that makes it easy to assemble and use for start-up twitchers.</p>

<p>First things first, make sure that your camera is being detected on Twitch Studio. If you do not already have a layer with your webcam on your scene, click Edit Scene and add a webcam layer by clicking the + icon on the left next to Layers.</p>
<p>Once your webcam layer has been created, make sure that the desired device is selected, plugged in, and that you have not turned off every webcam (Camera icon on the bottom left of Twitch Studio).</p>
<p>**<strong>Set Up Your Green Screen</strong></p>
<p>Once your green screen is set up in your background, select your webcam layers to display your webcam settings.</p>
<p>We recommend using the Auto-Detect Color feature as it will automatically detect the best color code for you and will be a great base to work from. If you prefer, you can manually pick the color code by either providing the color code in the Color to Remove field or clicking on the colored square to display a color spectrum that you can select from.</p>
<p>The Chroma Key section is located at the bottom of the webcam settings, and you will be able to toggle the chroma key on and off by clicking the eye icon.</p>
<p>To adjust the chroma key settings, you can click on Edit Chroma Key. You will be able to change the color code and change similarity, edge transparency and color correction for the perfect fit.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.</p>

Adding audio to a video is not that difficult, but choosing the right audio can be a hassle. You want something that captures the ears of the audience but, at the same time, compliments your video. The best way to do this is by adding music to your videos with <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p>The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we’ll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos"><a href="#How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="How different types of music affect your videos"></a>How different types of music affect your videos</h2><p>You can easily change the viewer’s perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1"><a href="#Example-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #1"></a>Example #1</h3><p>Let’s say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-1.gif"
                      alt="adding an uplifting beat to your video"
                ></p>
<p>Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from “inspiring” to “sinister.” It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding scary music to your video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" class="headerlink" title="Example #2"></a>Example #2</h3><p>For a better understanding, let’s look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-3.gif"
                      alt="changing the music of a movie scene"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let’s see how to choose the best music audio for your video.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-1-Identify-the-mood"><a href="#Tip-1-Identify-the-mood" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Identify the mood"></a>Tip #1: Identify the mood</h2><p>As we’ve demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-4.gif"
                      alt="identifying the mood of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you’ve figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.</p>

So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?</p>

<p>Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.</p>

We all have a favorite music genre, but sometimes that may not go well with our visuals. For example, you love country music but have a video about the nightlife in the city. Using country music in a video about the town does not match well and will confuse your audience.</p>

<p>The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we’ll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos-1"><a href="#How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How different types of music affect your videos"></a>How different types of music affect your videos</h2><p>You can easily change the viewer’s perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1-1"><a href="#Example-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #1"></a>Example #1</h3><p>Let’s say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.</p>

                      alt="adding an uplifting beat to your video"
                ></p>
<p>Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from “inspiring” to “sinister.” It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="Example-2-1"><a href="#Example-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #2"></a>Example #2</h3><p>For a better understanding, let’s look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="changing the music of a movie scene"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let’s see how to choose the best music audio for your video.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-1-Identify-the-mood-1"><a href="#Tip-1-Identify-the-mood-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Identify the mood"></a>Tip #1: Identify the mood</h2><p>As we’ve demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.</p>

                      alt="identifying the mood of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you’ve figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.</p>

<p>For starters, this vlogging camera seems the perfect package. The Fujifilm X-S10 provides the opportunity of developing vlogs under a 4K video resolution. This model is a little outdated with the advanced features; it fulfills the basic needs of a beginner who is new to vlogging. It also provides users with a 6-stop in-body stabilization with a 26.1 megapixels sensor to offer them beautiful results.</p>
<p>If you really wish to make a difference in your vlogging quality, you should consider buying this camera. This is the real deal!</p>

<p>If you have been following vloggers and vlogging classes, you will have definitely heard about this Canon vlog camera. The features offered across this package are one of the best you can find across any vlogging camera in the market. Where this camera model is still a recommendation of top-notch vloggers, it comes under a lightweight body. The structure makes it great for vlogging, accompanied by a 4K video resolution under 30fps.</p>
<p>Canon’s flip-up screen is one of the most highlighting features offered across such vlogging cameras, making them quite the choice. It is exceptionally good!</p>

<p>GoPro is considered a department of professionals. However, we won’t recommend the latest top-of-the-line models to beginners.

<p>Hyper-stabilization makes it quite compelling overall. Users are recommended to make great use of this vlogging camera if they’re making a start in vlogging. Are you hyped up?</p>

<p><strong>What is a Political Campaign Video?</strong></p>
<p>A political campaign video is quite similar to other forms of marketing videos. As a political candidate, you are the product, and the cause you’re promoting is your unique selling proposition. A political video helps to promote your cause to the voters. When entering into politics, political campaigns are one of the things you would need to learn how to do. It is the best way to get your message out to the voters. A political video informs the people about who you are, your values, and why you’re the best person to vote for. Your political video needs to be captivating, but more importantly, you need it to be informative and succinctly capture your spirit.</p>
<p>According to an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/us-political-ad-spending-to-hit-record-high/" >eMarketer report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, political ad spending has increased by 63.3%. Political ad spending on TV has increased by 82%. However, political videos go beyond TV as the best videos go viral organically on social media. There are several other video channels where you can also share your video. One thing is clear; political videos aren’t going anywhere, and if you’re exploring this path, you need to learn how to make one. Creating an effective political campaign video is essential, and the next section informs you how you can get it done.</p>
<p><strong>4 Political Campaign Video Ideas to Consider</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of political campaign video ideas. It all depends on your target audience and the cause you’re promoting. This section will provide you with four effective pollical campaign videos you can implement in your next political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-4.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is another idea you can implement for your political video. You can hold a Q&amp;A session on an Instagram story or any other platform that allows you to make a live stream. Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-5.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is an excellent idea for political campaign videos because it allows you to connect with a community better. Videos that focus on a community are an effective method of communicating with the community. You can request community members who support your campaign to feature in your video and share their views. It makes it easier for voters to connect with you because they will relate to their stories. Even better, your viewers might recognize some of the faces you use, promoting loyalty to your cause. Your campaign video will show how it affects everyday lives by engaging a community.</p>
<p>Attack political videos are also quite popular and involve a candidate who speaks negatively of another candidate. However, according to research, it is best to avoid such political videos as they have minimal effect on voter turnout. Additionally, it could backfire and affect you in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>How to Make a Political Campaign Video</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have four ideas you could utilize for your next political video; you’re probably wondering how you can go about it. Follow the steps outlined in this article to make an engaging and excellent political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Set Goals</strong></p>
<p>Before you begin making a political campaign video, you need to set the goals you want to achieve. What is the outcome you want from your video? Do you really want to get your name out there, and just how many people you are hoping to achieve that? Is the goal of the video to raise donations, or do you just want to remind people to vote?</p>
<p>Once you decide what you’re looking to get out of the video, you can now make the best decision regarding content, format, and the metrics you want to measure. You can also set SMART goals that will motivate you to achieve the goals you set for the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Decide Your Target Audience</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 3: What is Your Main Style and Message</strong></p>
<p>With the target audience decided and the goal in mind, create a message in a style you think is compelling and engaging. An example is using the Q&amp;A political video idea to provide more details about you and your cause that voters do not know already. When you’re looking to effectively get your name out there, you have to draw focus to your story. Start the video off strong so that people don’t get bored and exit the video.</p>
<p>You can ensure that your video offers different content from your popular marketing material. Let it be new but ensure you use the same brand element, so your viewers still know it is you.</p>

Planning helps you find out the resources you will need for the video. Additionally, you can use different storyboarding tools to plan the details of your political video.</p>
<p>At this point, you can choose to ask for external help to ensure everything goes as planned. For example, you could work with marketing experts or a political ad agency. Such external support has the experience and support to take your political campaign video to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Produce Your Political Campaign Video</strong></p>
<p>Now that everything needed is in place, it’s time to shoot your video. The equipment required usually depends on the style you’re looking to achieve. If you’re shooting the phone on your own, you need good lighting and a phone to pass your message successfully.</p>

<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>

Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

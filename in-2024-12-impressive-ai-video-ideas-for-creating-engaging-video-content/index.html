<p>Step 1: To create cute pet intros, first of all, open Filmora. Then head to the ‘Titles’ tab. You can search for any pet-related title template. Select a template that you like and drag it onto the timeline. You can double-click on the template to edit and customize it as you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

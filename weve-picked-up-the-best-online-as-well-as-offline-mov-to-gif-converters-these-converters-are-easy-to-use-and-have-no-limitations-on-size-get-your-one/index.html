<p>There are more than enough GIF makers available on the Internet. However, we’ve found it difficult to find quality MP4-to-GIF converters. Some of the tools that commonly pop up in your search results are either unreliable or simply bad at what they do. In some cases, you will also have to deal with intrusive ads and pop-ups.</p>
<p>Stop scrolling through a sea of options, and start converting your video files into animated GIFs in just a few steps. You no longer need to upload your files to some random website to get your desired results.</p>

<p>To get started, simply drag and drop your MOV file onto the interface of Filmora. Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose “Import Media Files” from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new window where you can select your desired video file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import media files in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let’s look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Trim to shorten the video</strong></p>
<p>Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="trim the video in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export as GIF</strong></p>
<p>Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="export mov to gif in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save the GIF file</strong></p>
<p>Click “Convert” to start the MOV to GIF conversion.</p>
<p>When it’s done, click “Open Folder”, and you’ll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.</p>

<p>To get started, simply drag and drop your MOV file onto the interface of Filmora. Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose “Import Media Files” from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new window where you can select your desired video file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-9.jpg"
                      alt="import media files in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let’s look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Trim to shorten the video</strong></p>
<p>Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-10.jpg"
                      alt="trim the video in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export as GIF</strong></p>
<p>Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="export mov to gif in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save the GIF file</strong></p>
<p>Click “Convert” to start the MOV to GIF conversion.</p>
<p>When it’s done, click “Open Folder”, and you’ll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.</p>

<p>To get started, simply drag and drop your MOV file onto the interface of Filmora. Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose “Import Media Files” from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new window where you can select your desired video file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import media files in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let’s look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Trim to shorten the video</strong></p>
<p>Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="trim the video in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export as GIF</strong></p>
<p>Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save the GIF file</strong></p>
<p>Click “Convert” to start the MOV to GIF conversion.</p>
<p>When it’s done, click “Open Folder”, and you’ll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.</p>

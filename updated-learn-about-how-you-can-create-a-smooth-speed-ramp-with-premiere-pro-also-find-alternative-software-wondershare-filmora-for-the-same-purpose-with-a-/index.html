<h3 id="Examples-of-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#Examples-of-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Speed Ramping"></a>Examples of Speed Ramping</h3><p>It works especially well when utilized to focus the viewer’s attention on a certain moment or action in your videos, such as a tough jump or an impending bullet. Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.</p>
<p>You may also use Speed Ramping to alter the runtime of your video to fit the time limits of other social media sites, such as Instagram and Vine. If you just have 30 seconds to deliver your video, the following are the two most common places where people apply speed ramping techniques:</p>
<p>Assume you are shooting a person walking and want the clip to play in slow motion so that viewers can clearly see the person’s face. In this scenario, speed ramping is precisely what you need since it enables you to do precisely that.</p>
<p>Do you remember the famous movie “The Matrix” scene, when Neo dodges the bullets? It’s not some typical scene; it’s a pretty good example of speed ramping.</p>

<p>If you want to go deep into the game, Speed Ramp offers some more advanced options that give you even more control over your speed modifications. The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-1"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-1" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-1"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-1" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-1"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<p>If you want to go deep into the game, Speed Ramp offers some more advanced options that give you even more control over your speed modifications. The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-2"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-2" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-2"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-2" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-2"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-2" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<p>If you want to go deep into the game, Speed Ramp offers some more advanced options that give you even more control over your speed modifications. The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-3"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth-3" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-3"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-3" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-3"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-3" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations.

According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers used the “mannequin challenge” to understand depth predictions.</p>
<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

<h3 id="01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content-3"><a href="#01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content"></a>01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content</h3><p>One of the main applications of <strong>AI on YouTube</strong> is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>
<h3 id="02Add-New-Video-Effects-3"><a href="#02Add-New-Video-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="02Add New Video Effects"></a>02Add New Video Effects</h3><p>The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment. You can now swap out backgrounds from videos with just one click due to the in-built AI features on YouTube. This AI neural feature is prepared by <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers to make it easier for the AI algorithms to understand video patterns. This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.</p>
<h3 id="03Maintain-Age-Restrictions-3"><a href="#03Maintain-Age-Restrictions-3" class="headerlink" title="03Maintain Age Restrictions"></a>03Maintain Age Restrictions</h3><p>Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature-3"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature-3" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>
<h3 id="05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-3"><a href="#05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-3" class="headerlink" title="05Training on Depth Prediction"></a>05Training on Depth Prediction</h3><p>YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers used the “mannequin challenge” to understand depth predictions.</p>
<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Cloth-Appearance"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Cloth-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make Cloth Appearance"></a>Part 2: How to Make Cloth Appearance</h2><p>Let’s start with the first one. Before you start, make sure you put the camera on a tripod or a steady surface, so it doesn’t move while filming.</p>
<p>Step1 For the first shot, you must throw a jacket on a stool. Make sure it lands on the stool or wherever your talent is going to sit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_1.jpg"
                      alt="throw a jacket on a stool"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Make a shot of your talent appearing from where the jacket landed. You can add some acting skills to make this shot more realistic.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make a shot of your talent appearing"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Download Filmora to edit your footage. You can get started by going to their official website.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_3.jpg"
                      alt="download filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Now split the first clip on the frame where your jacket lands on the stool. Place it on the first track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split the first clip on the frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Trim the second shot until the talents start acting and place it on the second track to match the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You need to film the empty plate with just a background. Then let the talent enter the frame and jump into the place.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="let the talent enter the frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora and place it onto the first video track.</p>
<p>Step3 Freeze the frame of the empty plate with just the background and extend it as necessary. Place the clip onto the second video track and trim it until the action of the talent jump starts.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="freeze the frame of the empty plate"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Delete the rest on the left. The trick is to use some explosion or smoke effect to hide the transition.</p>
<p>Step5 Use the green screen sample in the default menu here. Add some smoke effects available in film stock. Place it on the third video track and move it to hide the transition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Step1 First, record the empty plate with just a background. Let the talent jump in the frame and set up a green screen for the talent to jump in front of it. It will look like they’re falling from the ceiling.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="record the empty plate"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora again. Follow the steps from the second example so we have the subject appearing on the screen like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import the clip into filmora again"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Add the green screenshot onto the third video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add the green screenshot onto the third video track"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double-click on it, activate the setting window and then key out the background using the chroma key feature.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_12.jpg"
                      alt="activate the setting window "
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Move the clip until it covers only the first frame of the appearing clip. Now keyframe the following subject from the outer frame to the final position.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_13.jpg"
                      alt="move the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Now search for some smoke effects and put it upside down. So it looks like the ceiling is broken when the subject falls. Then add some camera shake to the fall.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="search for some smoke effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Drag the camera shake effect back to the top track and shorten it to an ideal length. You can also add some sound effects if you want to this video.</p>

<p>Intellectuals frequently complain that everyone has attention deficit disorder due to the Internet. According to studies, we only have an attention span of 8 seconds today. You need a punchy, concise message to keep viewers watching your video.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don’t Forget to Smile</strong></p>
<p>Individuals who smile frequently are perceived to be more confident and successful. Therefore, showing your audience that you are confident in your company and services is the best method to gain their trust.</p>
<p><strong>3. Look into the Camera</strong></p>
<p>Direct eye contact with the camera lens is essential. Although it may seem enticing, your sole audience is the person directly in front of you when you’re speaking.</p>
<p>Be mindful of the camera’s confined area. Bring it up to eye level and keep your gaze there rather than elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>There are several fantastic camera effects that you can experiment with in your videos. While some are well-known, others are less well-known and often used. We have mentioned the three fun ways to appear on camera above. We suggest using video editing software like Filmora to use these effects more effectively. You can use these appearance effects to create an atmosphere, make your story more understandable, or spice up the video.</p>

<h2 id="How-To-Use-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects-To-Make-Your-Videos-Pop"><a href="#How-To-Use-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects-To-Make-Your-Videos-Pop" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Face Tracking In After Effects To Make Your Videos Pop"></a>How To Use Face Tracking In After Effects To Make Your Videos Pop</h2><p><strong>Face Tracking</strong> is a process of identifying or locating human faces in digital images and videos, and it is used for a variety of applications, such as to re-target tools and effects to specific areas of the face, to track face data for rotoscoping&#x2F;motion stabilization, or to generate keyframes for facial expressions automatically.</p>
<p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two <strong>Face Tracking</strong> features, i.e., Outline Only and Detailed Feature. The former will help only to track the face, while the latter provides detailed data on different facial features to help you change the eye color, mouth movements, etc.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore <strong>Face Tracking,</strong> its applications, how it works, and its challenges and drawbacks. We will also provide an easy-to-follow guide on using the Face Tracking feature in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Face-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Face-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Face Tracking"></a>Part 1. What Is Face Tracking</h2><p>Face Tracking is a process of identifying or detecting the areas of the face, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, in a video or image. This effect can be used to track and animate face replacements, retouch footage, or add effects to a user’s face in live footage.</p>
<p>Where It Is Applied</p>
<p>Face Tracking can be used for a variety of applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing One Face With Another:</strong> This is helpful if you need to change the face of a character in video footage.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Automatic Effects:</strong> With this feature, you can apply effects to a face in live footage.</li>
<li><strong>Retouching Footage</strong>: Face Tracking can help you retouch a face in a video clip, for instance, you can smooth it or change the skin tone, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Robotic Devices:</strong> Certain robots use Face Tracking technology to perform human tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Face-Tracking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Face-Tracking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Face Tracking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Face Tracking Work?</h2><p>Face Tracking algorithms usually begin by detecting facial landmarks, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Once detected, the AI algorithms use them to track the face as it moves. This information can be used to perform various tasks, such as identifying the person’s emotions or estimating their head pose.</p>
<p>Face Tracking technology is constantly improving and is now being used in various new applications, such as to create 3D models of people’s faces, control robotic devices, and create more realistic avatars for virtual reality systems.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-The-Challenges-And-Drawbacks-Of-Face-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-The-Challenges-And-Drawbacks-Of-Face-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking"></a>Part 3. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking</h2><p>Face Tracking is a technology that has been growing in popularity in recent years. This technology allows computers to detect and track human faces in real-time. While Face Tracking has many potential applications, some challenges and drawbacks also need to be considered:</p>
<p>One of the main challenges with Face Tracking is that it can be difficult to track faces in different lighting conditions. Faces can also be obstructed by objects such as hats or glasses. Another challenge is that things like photographs, makeup, or masks can fool face tracking.</p>
<p>Some privacy concerns need to be considered when using Face Tracking. This technology can be used to collect sensitive data about people without their consent.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges and drawbacks, Face Tracking remains a promising technology with many potential applications, and it can help with many tasks such as identifying a perpetrator, finding a missing person, better security measures in banks and airports, and many more.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-The-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-The-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. The Face Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 4. The Face Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool that can be used for various purposes, including Face Tracking. This feature enables you to track the movement of a person’s face and detect specific parts of a face, including eyes, nose, mouth, etc., to let you work with these facial features individually.</p>
<p>For instance, you can change the mouth movement or pupil color without frame-by-frame adjustments. Moreover, you can measure facial features to see the details, such as how open the eye or mouth is.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Here’s a simple and quick rundown of the features of Face Tracking in Adobe After Effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help you detect faces and provide isolated data points to help you refine the content.</li>
<li>Retouch the face in a video without adjusting it frame by frame.</li>
<li>Let you export the tracking data to Character Animator for creating performance-based animations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Function</p>
<p>There are two Face Tracking functions in the Tracker panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face Tracking (Outline Only):</strong> This feature will only help you to outline the face in a video clip.</li>
<li><strong>Face Tracking (Detailed Features):</strong> This option will help you if you want to detect the different facial features and parts, including the eye, pupil, eyebrow, mouth, and nose. You can also take exact measurements of the features.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-5-The-Guidance-Of-Using-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-5-The-Guidance-Of-Using-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 5. The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>Follow the guidelines below to use Face Tracking in After Effects:</p>
<p>Face Tracking To Outline A Face</p>
<p>Step1Launch the <strong>After Effects</strong> software and click <strong>“File”</strong> in the top <strong>Toolbar.</strong> Select <strong>Import</strong> and click <strong>“File.”</strong> Find the video footage and add it to the <strong>Project panel.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-the-footage-to-the-project-panel.jpg"
                      alt="adding the footage to the project panel"
                ></p>
<p>Step2To add a new layer, drag and drop the video footage from the <strong>Project Panel</strong> to the <strong>Composition.</strong></p>
<p>Step3Drag the blue <strong>current-time indicator</strong> in the <strong>Timeline</strong> to a frame showing the face’s upright and front view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragging-the-blue-cti-to-a-frame-with-the-face-in-the-upright-and-front-position.jpg"
                      alt="dragging the blue cti to a frame with the face in the upright and front position"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Now, you have to draw a <strong>closed mask loosely</strong> around the face. This helps identify the region for locating the facial features. The top mask is used for <strong>Face Tracking</strong> if you have selected multiple masks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/creating-a-closed-mask-loosely-around-the-face.jpg"
                      alt="creating a closed mask loosely around the face"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Click the <strong>“Window”</strong> option from the top <strong>Toolbar</strong> and scroll down to <strong>“Tracker.”</strong> Select <strong>“Face Tracking (Outline Only)” as</strong> the tracking method in the <strong>Tracker Panel.</strong></p>
<p>Step6To make sure the tracking is working correctly, track forward or backward one frame at a time and click the <strong>“Start”</strong> button to start the analysis process of the frames. Once finished, you can find the <strong>Face Tracking data</strong> within the Composition.</p>
<p>Tracking Detailed Features And Extracting Facial Measurements</p>
<p>For detailed face features tracking, do the following steps in sequence:</p>
<p>Step1Import your file and add it to the <strong>Project</strong> in the <strong>After Effects</strong>. Drop and drag the video clip into a <strong>Composition</strong> from the <strong>Project Panel</strong> to add a layer.</p>
<p>Step2Position the <strong>CTI</strong> to a frame showing the upright and front view of the face, and draw a <strong>closed mask loosely</strong> around the face to define the search region to find the facial features.</p>
<p>Step3Click the <strong>“Window”</strong> option, scroll down to <strong>Tracker</strong> and select it. Choose the **“Face Tracking (Detailed Features)**” option as the tracking method.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/selecting-the-face-tracking-option.jpg"
                      alt="selecting the face tracking option"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Track forward or backward to check the tracking process, and click the <strong>“Start”</strong> button to initiate the analysis process.</p>
<p>Step5Once the analysis is done, you can find the tracking data within a new effect, <strong>“Face Track Point.”</strong> To access the face tracking data, go to <strong>“Window”</strong> and select <strong>“Effects Control”</strong> to go to the <strong>Effects Panel</strong> or check within the <strong>Composition.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/face-tracking-data-within-the-composition.jpg"
                      alt="face tracking data within the composition"
                ></p>
<p>Step6Move the <strong>CTI</strong> to a frame displaying <strong>neutral facial expressions</strong> or is in the rest pose. The measurements of a face on other frames are dependent on the rest pose frame. Now, click <strong>“Set Rest Pose”</strong> in the Tracker Panel and select <strong>“Extract &amp; Copy Face Measurements”</strong> to add the Face Measurement layer.</p>
<p>Step7When the Face Measurements effect layer is added, <strong>keyframes</strong> are automatically generated based on the <strong>Face Track Points keyframe data.</strong> You can copy the data from the system clipboard for use in <strong>Adobe Character Animator.</strong></p>

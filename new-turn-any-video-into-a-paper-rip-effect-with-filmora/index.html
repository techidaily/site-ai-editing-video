If you have already downloaded the Wondershare Filmora. Open it, and let’s start editing the video.</p>
<p>Step2 First, we need to find a photo of a white paper that you can easily download from the internet and two videos in which you want to add this effect. Then import these three files to the media gallery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-02.png"
                      alt="select the material"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag and drop <strong>Clip 1</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the last frame of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-03.png"
                      alt="drag-drop clip 1"
                ></p>
<p>Alt text: Paper rip effect.</p>
<p>Step4 Now right-click on <strong>Clip 1</strong> to open the menu and select <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-04.png"
                      alt="selecting add freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 After adding a freeze frame, cut here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-05.png"
                      alt="adding a cut"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline, and make sure it starts at the cut on the first video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-06.png"
                      alt="dropping paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Double-click the paper picture on the timeline to open the settings window and then open the <strong>Compositing</strong> menu. Then Change the <strong>Blending Mode</strong> from Normal to <strong>Multiply</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-07.png"
                      alt="opening compositing menu"
                ></p>
<p>In the preview window, we can see that the freeze frame has the paper texture now!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-08.png"
                      alt="freeze frame has a paper texture"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press <strong>“I”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>IN POINT</strong>, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press <strong>“O”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>OUT POINT</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-09.png"
                      alt="setting the in point"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.</p>
<p>Step9 Then click <strong>Export</strong> and choose <strong>Create Video</strong>. Let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and click on Export.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png"
                      alt="selecting create a video"
                ></p>
<p>It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the timeline and <strong>Cancel</strong> the selected range.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-011.png"
                      alt="exporting the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step10 Import the <strong>Freeze Frame 1</strong> to the media folder and replace the <strong>Freeze Frame + Paper Photo</strong> with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step11 Now let’s make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop <strong>Clip 2</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip’s first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the <strong>Alt+F</strong> keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a <strong>Cut</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-013.png"
                      alt="adding clip 2 to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png"
                      alt="adding paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting <strong>IN and OUT</strong> points as we did before. Press the <strong>I</strong> key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the <strong>O</strong> key.</p>

                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the <strong>Transitions window</strong> and find Evaporate 2.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="select the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between <strong>clip 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and the cut between <strong>clip 2</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. You can also adjust the length of the transition.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="dropping the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step18 Then, find <strong>Torned Paper Transition 4</strong> in the <strong>Transitions window</strong>. Drag and drop it to the cut between <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. Then choose <strong>Prefix</strong> mode in the transition setting video. Adjust the length if needed.</p>

If you have already downloaded the Wondershare Filmora. Open it, and let’s start editing the video.</p>
<p>Step2 First, we need to find a photo of a white paper that you can easily download from the internet and two videos in which you want to add this effect. Then import these three files to the media gallery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the material"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag and drop <strong>Clip 1</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the last frame of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-03.png"
                      alt="drag-drop clip 1"
                ></p>
<p>Alt text: Paper rip effect.</p>
<p>Step4 Now right-click on <strong>Clip 1</strong> to open the menu and select <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-04.png"
                      alt="selecting add freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 After adding a freeze frame, cut here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-05.png"
                      alt="adding a cut"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline, and make sure it starts at the cut on the first video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-06.png"
                      alt="dropping paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Double-click the paper picture on the timeline to open the settings window and then open the <strong>Compositing</strong> menu. Then Change the <strong>Blending Mode</strong> from Normal to <strong>Multiply</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-07.png"
                      alt="opening compositing menu"
                ></p>
<p>In the preview window, we can see that the freeze frame has the paper texture now!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-08.png"
                      alt="freeze frame has a paper texture"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press <strong>“I”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>IN POINT</strong>, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press <strong>“O”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>OUT POINT</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-09.png"
                      alt="setting the in point"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.</p>
<p>Step9 Then click <strong>Export</strong> and choose <strong>Create Video</strong>. Let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and click on Export.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png"
                      alt="selecting create a video"
                ></p>
<p>It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the timeline and <strong>Cancel</strong> the selected range.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-011.png"
                      alt="exporting the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step10 Import the <strong>Freeze Frame 1</strong> to the media folder and replace the <strong>Freeze Frame + Paper Photo</strong> with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step11 Now let’s make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop <strong>Clip 2</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip’s first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the <strong>Alt+F</strong> keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a <strong>Cut</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding clip 2 to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png"
                      alt="adding paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting <strong>IN and OUT</strong> points as we did before. Press the <strong>I</strong> key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the <strong>O</strong> key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-015.png"
                      alt="selecting in and out points"
                ></p>
<p>Step14 This time use the shortcut <strong>Control + E</strong> to open the export window. Again, let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> and then export it.</p>
<p>Step15 You can use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Shift + X</strong> to cancel the selected range. Then import <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> into the media folder and replace the freeze frame + paper photo. Adjust the length of this new clip to about 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-016.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the <strong>Transitions window</strong> and find Evaporate 2.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="select the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between <strong>clip 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and the cut between <strong>clip 2</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. You can also adjust the length of the transition.</p>

<p>Step18 Then, find <strong>Torned Paper Transition 4</strong> in the <strong>Transitions window</strong>. Drag and drop it to the cut between <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. Then choose <strong>Prefix</strong> mode in the transition setting video.

Among other functions, After Effects facilitates adding a countdown timer to your videos and this task can be done in multiple ways.</p>
<p>Listed below are these different methods.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Adding-Countdown-Timer-in-After-Effects-using-Expression-1"><a href="#Method-1-Adding-Countdown-Timer-in-After-Effects-using-Expression-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.

                      alt="after effects text layer"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Open the text options and click on Alt + Click on your PC (For the Mac -Option + Click) on the stopwatch of the Source Text.</p>
<p>Step3 Next, you need to insert the expression - timeToCurrentFormat() inside the expression area.</p>
<p>Step4 Now, set the composition frame rate to 60fps which will make it look like an actual countdown timer.</p>
<p>Step5 Now count it down, pre-compose everything and then reverse the speed of the composition.</p>
<p>Composition speed can be reversed, right-click on the same, go to Time and then choose Time Reverse Layer.</p>

Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using the Timecode plugin"></a>Method 2. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using the Timecode plugin</h3><p>In this method, you can use the Timecode plugin instead of using the “**timeToCurrentFormat()**” expression.</p>
<p>While using this <strong>after effects timer</strong> method, you would need to add a plugin to the New Solid that will create a timer layout automatically.</p>
<p>Next, follow the process as in the previous steps, and a countdown timer can be added.</p>

<p>Step2 Next, open the text options using Alt + Click for PC and Option + Click for Mac at the stopwatch of Source Text.</p>
<p>Step3 Next, at the expression area insert the expression- Math. Floor(-time) +10. Here in the place of 10, you can choose any number desired and this will be the starting countdown value.</p>
<p>Above we have learned 3 ways by which After Effects can be used for adding a countdown timer. Though these are workable methods, at times you may have issues with them and thus an alternate tool may be needed.</p>

We have collected some of the common reasons that lead to the countdown timer not working in After Effects.</p>
<p><strong>Software version out of date</strong></p>
<p>If the software version of After Effects is out of date, then several features including Countdown Timer may be missing or have issues with the same.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect values or command</strong></p>
<p>If the value for the countdown or the statement is incorrect while using After Effects, the countdown timer will not work properly.</p>
<p><strong>The steep learning curve of the software</strong></p>
<p>After Effects comes in with a wide range of features, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the procedure to use the tool. Thus, the software has a steep learning curve which can be a problem for a lot of users and have issues while creating a countdown timer.</p>

<p>The <strong>freeze-frame video editing</strong> effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.</p>
<p>In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.</p>

<p>Step 1: Download Premiere Pro</p>
<p>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro on your PC and open it to start editing your video. Import video to Premiere Pro and drag and drop to the timeline.</p>

<p>Take a picture of the video by dragging your pointer down to the camera icon and pressing it to take a photo while keeping the clip paused, where you want it to be frozen. When you do that, a menu of three options will appear; select Take Snapshots and Insert in Current Position. This choice will split the movie in half and insert the scene you just recorded in the middle, resulting in a freeze.</p>

<p>The <strong>freeze-frame video editing</strong> effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.</p>
<p>In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.</p>

<p>The <strong>freeze-frame video editing</strong> effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.</p>
<p>In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.</p>

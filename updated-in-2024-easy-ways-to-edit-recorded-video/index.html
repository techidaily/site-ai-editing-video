Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>

<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                      alt="obs customize the recording source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

And what’s the process that it takes us? How can we attract audiences and guarantee the viewers’ transition to loyalty? – these are the questions that people in the professions connected to the technology should ask. There is no recipe, but at least, we know what NOT to do – DO NOT create bad content! You will never have a desired amount of listeners for your podcasts if the voice of the actor or noise of the whole track is annoying, you will struggle to have success on Youtube if your shots are unpleasant to watch, and the list goes on – there are just too many things you should not do!</p>
<p>But sometimes bad quality just happens. It happens when you know you have a problem and it happens when you think everything is going well in producing. You might come back from the production and find out that every shot you took had bad lightning, or there was an almost naked guy running on the background, or there is a noise on the background that just makes the whole experience of watching and listening not worthwhile! This might be something that sinks your heart…</p>
<p>But the mistakes we make don’t ensure that there has been a verdict cast for our failure. Nowadays, the will is everything – if you are really willing to make something work, you will just have to find the right tools, and learn a little about them, and, Voila! – Maybe you can turn bad into something good? Unacceptable into something acceptable? Annoying into interesting, and unpleasant into enjoyable?</p>
<p>This is called EDITING. And Editing covers different, almost endless days – too many computer programs, too many tools, too many opportunities to modify almost anything you want to make look and sound better - All of this feels like magic!</p>
<p>Among many instruments and techniques, there is one thing called denoising, with two different meaning. You might find noise in two areas – video and audio. Audio denoising means to remove or reduce the background noise, such as air conditioner hum, someone screaming from far away, birds chirping, the waves, etc. the noise in photo and video terms means that the scene we are looking at is grainy and makes watching the scene a little more difficult, with a less clear picture. And whenever these kind of things appear, mostly out of the blue, – because no one wants to take a bad video or record a bad voice-over, - our magical tools and abilities come to play…</p>
<p>One of those is called Adobe Premiere Pro, using for video editing, viewed as the most sophisticated video editor software. So, in this article, we will learn how to handle bot noise-s – in video as well as audio terms, and how to create a better viewer&#x2F;listener experience in this very program. Lastly, we’ll touch upon an alternative for background noise removal, so, there’s nothing left but tuning in!</p>
<p><strong>Video denoising in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved through using effect which is called Median. Before discovering it, without any doubt, we need to add our footage into the Timeline in Premiere Pro. Then, we can proceed to finding the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found – just drag and drop the effect to your clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>In order to make sure that the Median touches the grainiest parts of the whole clip, we need to use something called masks. In the Effects Control panel, we can select the mask shape for our clip –either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. Pen tool is something with which we move the Mask around the screen and resize it to include the desired area and cover it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Changing Feather setting to 100 will make sure that the effect loses a visible edge and there is some smoothness added to those edges.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-3.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>There might be the need to repeat this process and create several masks, if that means to have covered all of the grainy area of the scene.</p>
<p>Lastly, tom reduce the noise, adjusting the effect settings is needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Technically, what the Median effect does is just blurring the graininess, not exactly “taking it away”. And if we play with the Radius settings there, we can find our desired look!</p>
<p><strong>How to remove background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Removing background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a pretty simple process and lead to much better results. First of all, of course, import the desired material into your software so you can see the video and audio in the sequence visually. After having the project set up, you will need to find the Efffects Panel, which might be hidden a little, but it must be on the left and bottom of the program layout; or, you can find it on the top, in the navbar.</p>

<p>Basically, it only has one, Amount scale, and if you drag the slider of it to the right at 100%, it will remove the whole noise, but setting it on 0% will not remove any noise at all. So, you need to choose your preferred percentage! Just listen what is acceptable for you, but the general suggestion here would be that you can choose as high percent as you want, but if the effect starts taking out the voice and actually wanted parts, then you will have to stop and keep it that way.

<p><strong>Bonus tip: how to remove audio noise in video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>What we have promised in the beginning in the video, we like to offer now – the alternative to reduce or remove audio noise in the video is called Wondershare Filmora, which functions in a very simple way. So, we can start using these guides:</p>
<p>Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-clicking on the video and hitting Detach Audio will enable us to separate audio and video from one another, getting us a chance to work on them individually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the audio track shows the editing panel, where we see Remove background noise – choosing this option removes the noise!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Though, there is another way to do this too. If you don’t want to detach the audio, then first, double-click on the video clip in the timeline and when the editing panel opens, switch to Audio. If you check the box next to Remove background noise, you will see that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, which determine the strength of how toe noise is going to be reduced. Choosing one of them is up to you!</p>
<p>In case you find that the voice sounds a little robotics, you’ll need to make it sound more natural, of course. For it, you will need to click Customize, which will take you into the Customize Equalizer department.</p>

<p>The low tunes are on the left, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often the low ones, so we better lower them even more, but we would raise the middle ones to achieve a natural sound.</p>

                ></p>
<p>And, that’s it – you are done with audio background noise removal!</p>
<p>So, in this article, we learned how to remove the video noise and grain and audio background noise using the software Adobe Premire Pro, while we also discussed how to do the latter using Wondershare Filmora – hope you can start using your new knowledge and tools very soon and create the content you never thought you could have created!</p>
<p>In order to make sure that the Median touches the grainiest parts of the whole clip, we need to use something called masks. In the Effects Control panel, we can select the mask shape for our clip –either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. Pen tool is something with which we move the Mask around the screen and resize it to include the desired area and cover it.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Changing Feather setting to 100 will make sure that the effect loses a visible edge and there is some smoothness added to those edges.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>There might be the need to repeat this process and create several masks, if that means to have covered all of the grainy area of the scene.</p>
<p>Lastly, tom reduce the noise, adjusting the effect settings is needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Technically, what the Median effect does is just blurring the graininess, not exactly “taking it away”. And if we play with the Radius settings there, we can find our desired look!</p>
<p><strong>How to remove background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Removing background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a pretty simple process and lead to much better results. First of all, of course, import the desired material into your software so you can see the video and audio in the sequence visually. After having the project set up, you will need to find the Efffects Panel, which might be hidden a little, but it must be on the left and bottom of the program layout; or, you can find it on the top, in the navbar.</p>

<p>Lastly, tom reduce the noise, adjusting the effect settings is needed.</p>

<p>Technically, what the Median effect does is just blurring the graininess, not exactly “taking it away”. And if we play with the Radius settings there, we can find our desired look!</p>
<p><strong>How to remove background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p>
<p>Removing background noise in Adobe Premiere Pro can be a pretty simple process and lead to much better results. First of all, of course, import the desired material into your software so you can see the video and audio in the sequence visually. After having the project set up, you will need to find the Efffects Panel, which might be hidden a little, but it must be on the left and bottom of the program layout; or, you can find it on the top, in the navbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-5.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>After having located the Effects panel, go for the search bar and type: denoise, and you’ll see that DeNoise effect is under Audio Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-6.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>You hold onto the effect, drag and drop it on the audio track in the timeline itself! Then, you just click on the audio in the sequence and on the top right Effect Controls will appear, which we need to concentrate on. You will scroll down a little there and below Audio notice: fx DeNoise, where you hit on the Edit button. This will open the Clip Fx Editor for the Audio denoising.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Basically, it only has one, Amount scale, and if you drag the slider of it to the right at 100%, it will remove the whole noise, but setting it on 0% will not remove any noise at all. So, you need to choose your preferred percentage! Just listen what is acceptable for you, but the general suggestion here would be that you can choose as high percent as you want, but if the effect starts taking out the voice and actually wanted parts, then you will have to stop and keep it that way. So, that’s actually it!</p>
<p><strong>Bonus tip: how to remove audio noise in video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>What we have promised in the beginning in the video, we like to offer now – the alternative to reduce or remove audio noise in the video is called Wondershare Filmora, which functions in a very simple way. So, we can start using these guides:</p>
<p>Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-clicking on the video and hitting Detach Audio will enable us to separate audio and video from one another, getting us a chance to work on them individually.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-8.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the audio track shows the editing panel, where we see Remove background noise – choosing this option removes the noise!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-premiere-pro-9.jpg"
                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>Though, there is another way to do this too. If you don’t want to detach the audio, then first, double-click on the video clip in the timeline and when the editing panel opens, switch to Audio. If you check the box next to Remove background noise, you will see that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, which determine the strength of how toe noise is going to be reduced. Choosing one of them is up to you!</p>
<p>In case you find that the voice sounds a little robotics, you’ll need to make it sound more natural, of course. For it, you will need to click Customize, which will take you into the Customize Equalizer department.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="denoise-premiere-pro"
                ></p>
<p>The low tunes are on the left, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often the low ones, so we better lower them even more, but we would raise the middle ones to achieve a natural sound.</p>

                ></p>
<p>And, that’s it – you are done with audio background noise removal!</p>
<p>So, in this article, we learned how to remove the video noise and grain and audio background noise using the software Adobe Premire Pro, while we also discussed how to do the latter using Wondershare Filmora – hope you can start using your new knowledge and tools very soon and create the content you never thought you could have created!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-photography"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-photography" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR photography?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR photography?</h2><p>First things first. Before using the HDR feature on your smartphone, let’s learn what actually is the function of HDR.</p>
<p>Standing for High Dynamic Range, HDR is an image capturing method where the dynamic range of an image is high. When we talk about dynamic range, it refers to the difference between the lightest and the darkest elements of a picture. Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.</p>
<p>While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.</p>
<p>Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.</p>

A simpler alternative to this is using an Android device. The principle of capturing HDR images using an Android phone is simpler in comparison to a professional DSLR camera and also quick. Using an Android device, the imbalance in the exposure is corrected and the details of the image background, as well as the foreground, are enhanced.</p>
<p><strong>How-to steps to check the HDR camera Android feature</strong></p>
<p>So now that you know that HDR images can be easily captured using your Android device, the next important thing is to check if your phone supports the HDR feature or not as not all Android devices have the HDR mode. Below listed are some of the options where you can the HDR option in the camera app of your Android device.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for the HDR option under the Shooting Mode menu (this can be found on high-end Samsung phones.)</li>
<li>In the devices like HTC One X, Desire X, and others with custom Camera apps, the feature can be found under the Camera Scenes section.</li>
<li>In case you cannot locate the HDR option in both the above methods then try looking for it under the Settings menu of Camera. Devices like Sony Xperia T and Xperia V have the option here.</li>
<li>For the Nexus 4 device that runs on Android 4.2 OS, the option of HDR mode can be turned on by simply long-tapping the viewfinder and then tapping on the HDR icon.</li>
<li>You may also find the option of HDR mode under the labels like Backlight HDR or Backlight Correction HDR. On the Samsung Galaxy devices, HDR is labeled as Rich Tone and can be located under the Smart Modes menu.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>To take your mobile photography to another level and capture interesting and bright images, HDR mode is one of the great options to use. So, even if your smartphone does not support the HDR feature, install an app from the Google Store. When it comes to HDR videos and their editing, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> works as the best tool as it helps to add those little tweaks and customize your files without worrying about the quality or washed-out color.</p>

So, if your device does not have this function, no need to worry as there are Android apps available for the same. You can search and download one such HDR-capable camera app on your device from Google Play Store and enjoy capturing HDR images.</p>
<p>One such widely used app is HDR Camera that simple to use and allows for capturing high-quality HDR pictures. Using the upgraded version of the app you can even edit your captured images.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to using HDR Camera Apps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 First of all, download, install, and launch the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ezprt.hdrcamera&hl=en_IN&gl=US" >HDR Camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app on your Android smartphone.</p>
<p>Step2 The interface of the app looks like the interface of the Android camera and the majority of the screen is taken up by the viewfinder.</p>
<p>Step3 Next, simply start taking the picture as you would do normally by pointing towards the subject and clicking on the shutter button.</p>
<p>Step4 If you have opted for the advanced version of the app, you can even add a pre-set filter or edit your images as needed.</p>
<p>Step5 Finally, save the HDR-captured image on your phone.</p>

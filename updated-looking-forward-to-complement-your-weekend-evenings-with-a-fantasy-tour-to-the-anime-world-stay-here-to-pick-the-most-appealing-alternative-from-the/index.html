<h3 id="How-To-Combine-Video-With-Two-Audio-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#How-To-Combine-Video-With-Two-Audio-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg"></a>How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg</h3><p>Are you looking to add multiple audio tracks to your video? With FFmpeg, you can easily combine video with two audio streams. Whether creating a foreign-language version of your video or adding an alternate audio track, this method will help you achieve professional results. This section will guide you through combining video with two audio streams using FFmpeg’s command-line interface. So, let’s get started!</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video</strong></p>
<p>Combining multiple audio tracks into one video can be done easily with FFmpeg’s command-line interface. In this example, we will combine two audio tracks into one video so that the voiceover will play over the background music. Here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Open</strong> your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your video and audio files are located.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Replace</strong> “<strong>video1.mp4</strong>“ and “<strong>audio1.mp3</strong>“ with the names of your actual video and audio files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p><em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step3 The <strong>-c:v copy</strong> flag tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream from the source file without re-encoding it. This helps to speed up the process and avoid quality loss.</p>
<p><em>-c:v copy \</em></p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 The command “<strong>amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest</strong>“ tells amix to accept 2 inputs (<strong>0:a and 1:a</strong>) and <strong>combine</strong> them into an output stream called <strong>audio_out</strong>, with the duration of the longest input.</p>
<p><em>[0:a][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Map</strong> the video stream <strong>(0:v)</strong> and the mixed audio stream <strong>(audio_out)</strong> into the final output video.</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step6 The <strong>-y flag</strong> tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>Once complete, you’ll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video Adjusting Volume</strong></p>
<p>We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.</p>
<p>And here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Start</strong> the command by specifying the input files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> option to specify a filter graph.</p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a] volume&#x3D;0.5 [music];</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>amix</strong> filter to take the “<strong>music</strong>“ stream and <strong>audio1.mp3</strong> and <strong>mix</strong> them.</p>
<p> <em>[music][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>map</strong> option to <strong>specify</strong> which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.</p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Specify</strong> the output file name as “<strong>output.mp4</strong>“ and the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.</p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay</strong></p>
<p>When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here’s how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>adelay filter</strong> to add delay to the audio track.</p>
<p><em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice];</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Mix</strong> the delayed audio track with the original audio track</p>
<p><em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out]</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Map</strong> the video and audio tracks to the output file</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>The final command would look like this:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice]; \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using FFmpeg and Filmora, you can easily combine video with audio, merge multiple video files, and add subtitles to your videos. Both tools offer different features and learning curves, so it’s important to understand what you need before choosing one. Filmora is a great option for beginners and those who want a user-friendly interface, while FFmpeg is a powerful command-line tool for advanced users.</p>
<ul>
<li>“<strong>-i INPUT_FILE.mp4</strong>“ flag specifies INPUT_FILE.mp4 as the input source.</li>
<li>“<strong>-i AUDIO.wav</strong>,” tells FFmpeg to take AUDIO.wav as an input source.</li>
<li>The “<strong>-c:v copy</strong>“ flag is a short form of “<strong>-codec:v copy</strong>,” which means to copy the video stream from the source files to the destination file.</li>
<li>The “<strong>-c:a aac</strong>“ flag means selecting all the audio streams from the source files and then encoding them with the AAC encoder.</li>
<li>“<strong>mp4</strong>“ specifies the name of the output file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step3 In case you don’t want any audio conversion, <strong>drop</strong> the aac part in the command and <strong>replace</strong> it with copy; the command would look like this:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i INPUT_FILE.mp4 -i AUDIO.aac -c:v copy -c:a copy OUTPUT_FILE.mp4</em></p>

<h3 id="How-To-Combine-Video-With-Two-Audio-Using-FFmpeg-1"><a href="#How-To-Combine-Video-With-Two-Audio-Using-FFmpeg-1" class="headerlink" title="How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg"></a>How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg</h3><p>Are you looking to add multiple audio tracks to your video? With FFmpeg, you can easily combine video with two audio streams. Whether creating a foreign-language version of your video or adding an alternate audio track, this method will help you achieve professional results. This section will guide you through combining video with two audio streams using FFmpeg’s command-line interface. So, let’s get started!</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video</strong></p>
<p>Combining multiple audio tracks into one video can be done easily with FFmpeg’s command-line interface. In this example, we will combine two audio tracks into one video so that the voiceover will play over the background music. Here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Open</strong> your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your video and audio files are located.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Replace</strong> “<strong>video1.mp4</strong>“ and “<strong>audio1.mp3</strong>“ with the names of your actual video and audio files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p><em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step3 The <strong>-c:v copy</strong> flag tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream from the source file without re-encoding it. This helps to speed up the process and avoid quality loss.</p>
<p><em>-c:v copy \</em></p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 The command “<strong>amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest</strong>“ tells amix to accept 2 inputs (<strong>0:a and 1:a</strong>) and <strong>combine</strong> them into an output stream called <strong>audio_out</strong>, with the duration of the longest input.</p>
<p><em>[0:a][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Map</strong> the video stream <strong>(0:v)</strong> and the mixed audio stream <strong>(audio_out)</strong> into the final output video.</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step6 The <strong>-y flag</strong> tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>Once complete, you’ll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video Adjusting Volume</strong></p>
<p>We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.</p>
<p>And here’s the step-by-step process:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Start</strong> the command by specifying the input files.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> option to specify a filter graph.</p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a] volume&#x3D;0.5 [music];</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>amix</strong> filter to take the “<strong>music</strong>“ stream and <strong>audio1.mp3</strong> and <strong>mix</strong> them.</p>
<p> <em>[music][1:a] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>map</strong> option to <strong>specify</strong> which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.</p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p>Step5 <strong>Specify</strong> the output file name as “<strong>output.mp4</strong>“ and the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.</p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p><strong>Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay</strong></p>
<p>When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here’s how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>adelay filter</strong> to add delay to the audio track.</p>
<p><em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice];</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Mix</strong> the delayed audio track with the original audio track</p>
<p><em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out]</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Map</strong> the video and audio tracks to the output file</p>
<p><em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-y flag</strong> to overwrite the output file</p>
<p><em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>The final command would look like this:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg \</em></p>
<p> <em>-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \</em></p>
<p> <em>-filter_complex “ \</em></p>
<p> <em>[1:a] adelay&#x3D;2100|2100 [voice]; \</em></p>
<p> <em>[0:a][voice] amix&#x3D;inputs&#x3D;2:duration&#x3D;longest [audio_out] \</em></p>
<p> <em>“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-map 0:v -map “[audio_out]“ \</em></p>
<p> <em>-y output.mp4</em></p>
<p>This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.</p>

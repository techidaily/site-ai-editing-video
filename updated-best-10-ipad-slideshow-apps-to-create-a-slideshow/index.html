<h5 id="Step4Concentrate-and-Film-3"><a href="#Step4Concentrate-and-Film-3" class="headerlink" title="Step4Concentrate and Film"></a>Step4Concentrate and Film</h5><p>Usually before filming I pray for guidance and knowledge. This is essential to me I do it before filming so that I can be guided and finish what I’m doing properly and less struggle.</p>
<p>If you are done the you can now start filming. Used your script to start talking to the camera, remember to be happy mood while doing this tutorial. Make your viewers feel good while watching you and don’t forget to tell them what product you are using. Also leave some comment to where they can buy the product you are using on your video.</p>

                      alt="concentrate and film makeup video"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-and-Upload-3"><a href="#Step5Edit-and-Upload-3" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit and Upload"></a>Step5Edit and Upload</h5><p>This is the last step for making a makeup video. Edit your video properly and make your video creative to attract more viewers. Cut the unwanted clips especially the part where you’re just talking. Because sometime viewers get bored if they only see you talking. Create a nice animation or transition to make your video stands out.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/edit-and-upload-makeup-video.jpg"
                      alt="edit and upload makeup video"
                ></p>
<p>Then upload your finish video to your Youtube channel, make sure to public and promote your video so that more viewers will see how great you are in making this kind of videos. Remember to share your video to all your social media account to have more viewers and subscribers, don’t be shy to tell also your family and friends that you made a video so they can see the finished product of your hard work video tutorial and ask them to leave comment and suggestion if you have anything else to change or fix in making video, because for us content creator people’s feedback is very important so we can do better next time.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Now that you already knew the gear that you need to start setting up your studio for your makeup video and you also knew the step-by-step process, you are now ready to film a makeup video. But remember this you can’t just put makeup on your face style your hair and end the video. As a beauty vlogger, you’re an entertainer, so open dialogue is essential when filming. Ask your audience what they want to see, more importantly always remember to ask for feedback because for us content creator viewers feedback is very important so we can do better next time.If you’ve just started this inspiring journey of becoming a beauty Youtuber then hopefully these tips on how to create a makeup video will helped.</p>

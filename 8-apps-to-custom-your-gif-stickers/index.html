The increase in technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antennas, Wi-Fi RTT, and ultra-wideband (UWB) make indoor navigation much more practical than before. One of the most useful applications of this technology is for displaying AR directions in large indoor locations like delivery centers, shopping malls, and airports.</p>

<p>By using indoor navigation, things bought online and picked up in-store services can be more well-organized. Group members whose job is to ‘pick’ the items in the store for order fulfillment can use AR directions for navigating and finding the item as different to following coordinated directions to find the item. This saves a lot of time looking through similar items and finding the exact aisle and section of the store.</p>

<p>There are psychological healthiness apps helping individuals maintain psychological balance during these grim times.AR technology can also improve telemedicine solutions that are rising currently, such as drawing and interpreting on the 3D screen can make communication between doctors and patients much easier.</p>
<h3 id="03Augmented-Reality-Shopping"><a href="#03Augmented-Reality-Shopping" class="headerlink" title="03Augmented Reality Shopping"></a>03Augmented Reality Shopping</h3><p>Augmented reality has a huge part in the shopping sector.

The increase in technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antennas, Wi-Fi RTT, and ultra-wideband (UWB) make indoor navigation much more practical than before. One of the most useful applications of this technology is for displaying AR directions in large indoor locations like delivery centers, shopping malls, and airports.</p>

<p>By using indoor navigation, things bought online and picked up in-store services can be more well-organized. Group members whose job is to ‘pick’ the items in the store for order fulfillment can use AR directions for navigating and finding the item as different to following coordinated directions to find the item. This saves a lot of time looking through similar items and finding the exact aisle and section of the store.</p>

In this section, we will highlight three ways through which you can use the adjustment layer in Premiere Pro to edit your videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Color-Grading-1"><a href="#1-Color-Grading-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Color Grading"></a>1. Color Grading</h3><p>Color grading in Premiere Pro can help you to adjust the balance and tone of your video. You can use the color grading effects and tools to set the exposure, brightness, saturation, and light according to your preference. It will also let you redefine the colors in your video efficiently. To use the adjustment layer for color grading, you can read the below instructions:</p>
<p>Step1 After uploading the video clip in Premiere Pro, create a new adjustment layer in the timeline. Drag and adjust it according to the duration of your video clip. Once done, go to the “Effects” tab and search for “FilmConvert Nitrate.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the film convert nitrate option"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Apply this effect to the adjustment layer and choose your camera to match the color profile. Afterward, you can adjust the saturation, exposure filmstock, and curves according to your choice. You can also increase the vibrancy and hue saturation curves for more enhancement. You can also navigate to the basic correction section to modify the contrast value accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="2-Transition-1"><a href="#2-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Transition"></a>2. Transition</h3><p>To merge multiple video clips smoothly and efficiently, transitional effects can assist you. By adding a suitable transition effect, you can make your whole video look clean and cinematic. Moreover, you can use adjustment layers in Premiere Pro to add transition effects to your effect professionally. To do the transition effect, you can proceed to the following instructions:</p>
<p>Step1 First, drag and drop your video clips into the timeline. Once done, create the adjustment layer and apply it above the layers of video clips. Once done, search the “Offset” effect and apply it to the adjustment layer.</p>
<p>Step2 Now add the keyframe to the position where you want to start and end the transition effect. Afterward, right-click on the first keyframe and select “Temporal Interpolation.” From there, choose “Ease Out.” Repeat the same process with the last keyframe. Once done, add the “Directional blur” effect to the adjustment layer for a smoother look.</p>

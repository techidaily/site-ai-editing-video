<h2 id="Tips-for-a-Fantastic-Logo-Intro"><a href="#Tips-for-a-Fantastic-Logo-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro"></a>Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro</h2><p>We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let’s discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn’t do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.</li>
<li>Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.</li>
<li>It wouldn’t be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.</li>
<li>Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don’t want to miss what comes next.</li>
<li>Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.</li>
<li>The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don’t bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="People-Also-Ask"><a href="#People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Before we bid you goodbye, let’s answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.</p>
<h3 id="Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro"><a href="#Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?"></a>Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?</h3><p>You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn’t know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company’s logo that features before a movie.</p>
<p>Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.</p>
<h3 id="Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal"><a href="#Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?"></a>Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?</h3><p>Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.</p>
<p>A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.</p>
<h3 id="Q3-What-Are-the-5-Rules-of-a-Good-Logo"><a href="#Q3-What-Are-the-5-Rules-of-a-Good-Logo" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?"></a>Q3. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?</h3><p>You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg"
                      alt="5 rules of a good logo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Unique</strong></p>
<p>It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else’s. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else’s logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong></p>
<p>Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile</strong></p>
<p>Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don’t exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn’t look aesthetically pleasing.</p>

Without further ado, let’s discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn’t do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.</li>
<li>Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.</li>
<li>It wouldn’t be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.</li>
<li>Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don’t want to miss what comes next.</li>
<li>Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.</li>
<li>The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don’t bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="People-Also-Ask-1"><a href="#People-Also-Ask-1" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Before we bid you goodbye, let’s answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.</p>
<h3 id="Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro-1"><a href="#Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro-1" class="headerlink" title="Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?"></a>Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?</h3><p>You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn’t know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company’s logo that features before a movie.</p>
<p>Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.</p>
<h3 id="Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal-1"><a href="#Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal-1" class="headerlink" title="Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?"></a>Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?</h3><p>Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.</p>
<p>A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting.

What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?</h3><p>You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Unique</strong></p>
<p>It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else’s. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else’s logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong></p>
<p>Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile</strong></p>
<p>Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don’t exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn’t look aesthetically pleasing.</p>

Video content is entertaining, easy to understand and can offer better ROI as you can reuse it. However, with the huge volume of these files, it has become more challenging to find a good storage option.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a good storage option"
                ></p>
<p>This is where cloud storage comes to play. There are different cloud disk or storage platforms where you can <strong>upload video to link</strong> and share your videos with others. For example, Google storage or Google Drive. So, let’s know the process of uploading a video to Google Drive.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, visit your Google Drive Account and then click on the new option.</li>
<li>Now, you need to click on File Upload and then select the video that you want to upload.</li>
<li>You can now see the selected video uploading in the screen’s lower left corner. It will take some time.</li>
<li>Once done, Google Drive will begin processing the video.</li>
<li>Once your video is available on Google Drive, you can move it to different folders or change the name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s talk about how to generate a link to your video and share that link with others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your Google Drive account.</li>
<li>Choose the video that you want to share and right-click on it.</li>
<li>Now, you need to click on the Get Link option.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Anyone with the Link option from the viewer option.</li>
<li>Now, click on the Copy Link option, and you can now share that link with anyone you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different reasons that make cloud storage options a perfect choice for video creators or other users. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t have to worry about data loss.</li>
<li>Cloud storage is highly scalable.</li>
<li>There will be no space or storage limit</li>
<li>The users can enjoy real-time video content updates</li>
<li>One can access and share videos using any device.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, some of the cloud storage platforms are not free to use. You will get up to 10GB to 20GB for free. For more storage limits, you will have to buy a subscription plan. For example, if you are using Dropbox, then you will have to pay around USD 20 per month to get up to 3TB of storage.</p>
<p>Besides, there are some content restrictions that you will have to consider. You are not allowed to upload videos that support malicious attacks, hate speech, graphic violence, predatory behavior or videos that promote any dangerous behavior. Besides, the platforms support certain types of video formats, such as OGG, WebM files, WMV, MTS, AVI, and WMV. FLV, 3GPP, MPEG 4, MOV and other file formats.</p>
<p>If you are looking for some free cloud storage platforms, then you can give Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, NeXT cloud, pCloud, Amazon Cloud Drive and OneDrive a try.</p>

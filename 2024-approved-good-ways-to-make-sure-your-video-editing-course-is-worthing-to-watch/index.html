<h2 id="Introduction-1"><a href="#Introduction-1" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>It will be much fun if you get to assort most of your GIF files and turn them into full-length streaming videos. However, many conversion websites and software on the internet offer you the facility to <strong>convert GIF to AVI</strong> file format with ease of use. With these online tools, you also get the opportunity to upload the converted file on various social media channels. Unlike real video, these files have less memory and are easy to save on your device or hard disk.</p>
<p>Although both AVI and GIF are two commonly used file formats, they are different. First of all, GIF stands for Graphical Interchange Format, and it is an image format that can store several consequent or dis-consequent pictures into an animated file. In contrast, AVI is a lossless video file format. This guide focuses on turning GIF animated images into AVI videos and gives a list of the best <strong>GIF to AVI converters</strong> you can choose from.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction-2"><a href="#Introduction-2" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>It will be much fun if you get to assort most of your GIF files and turn them into full-length streaming videos. However, many conversion websites and software on the internet offer you the facility to <strong>convert GIF to AVI</strong> file format with ease of use. With these online tools, you also get the opportunity to upload the converted file on various social media channels. Unlike real video, these files have less memory and are easy to save on your device or hard disk.</p>
<p>Although both AVI and GIF are two commonly used file formats, they are different. First of all, GIF stands for Graphical Interchange Format, and it is an image format that can store several consequent or dis-consequent pictures into an animated file. In contrast, AVI is a lossless video file format. This guide focuses on turning GIF animated images into AVI videos and gives a list of the best <strong>GIF to AVI converters</strong> you can choose from.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction-3"><a href="#Introduction-3" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>It will be much fun if you get to assort most of your GIF files and turn them into full-length streaming videos. However, many conversion websites and software on the internet offer you the facility to <strong>convert GIF to AVI</strong> file format with ease of use. With these online tools, you also get the opportunity to upload the converted file on various social media channels. Unlike real video, these files have less memory and are easy to save on your device or hard disk.</p>
<p>Although both AVI and GIF are two commonly used file formats, they are different. First of all, GIF stands for Graphical Interchange Format, and it is an image format that can store several consequent or dis-consequent pictures into an animated file. In contrast, AVI is a lossless video file format. This guide focuses on turning GIF animated images into AVI videos and gives a list of the best <strong>GIF to AVI converters</strong> you can choose from.</p>

<p><strong>Detailed User Guide to Create Aquasoft Slideshow</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download the Software Program</strong></p>
<p>Visit the official Aquasoft website to initiate a free download the slideshow product kit to your Windows or MacOS compatible system and proceed to install and launch the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Project Selection</strong></p>
<p>Launching the Aquasoft slideshow program successfully will guide you to the latter’s welcome interface, where you will have to select a new slideshow project in the 4:3 aspect ratio. Move ahead with selecting a presentation layout by navigating to the ‘View’ tab in the toolbar at the top and clicking on the ‘Layout’ option from its dropdown menu. You will also see the project ‘Timeline’ appear at this instant.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Your Images</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with choosing the layout, navigate to the top toolbar again and hit the ‘Add’ tab. From the dropdown that follows, click on ‘Images’ to include a photo within the presentation. You can also include a complete directory of images by selecting the ‘Directory’ option from the ‘Add’ dropdown. Your chosen images will appear in the project ‘Timeline’.</p>
<p>If you want to rearrange the order of the selected images, you can do so by clicking on the ‘Edit’ tab in the toolbar at the top, followed by choosing the ‘Sort’ option from the dropdown that follows next. The app sets the images in a natural logical order, while also allowing you to rearrange them manually.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Images"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Include a Background Music</strong></p>
<p>To complement your <strong>Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate</strong> presentation with a suitable background audio, visit the top toolbar and click on the ‘Add’ tab and select ‘Background Music’ from the list of options that appears next. A series of music titles will appear as you click on the ‘+’ icon in the ‘Background Music’ interface. You are allowed to reset the order of the listed music files through a mouse click.</p>
<p>If you want to remove the music titles, click on the ‘Trash Bin’ icon beside the ‘+’ button. To adjust the settings of a particular music tile, click on the same and make suitable parameter adjustments. When you are satisfied with the changes, click ‘OK’. Your final selections of the background music will appear in the app’s project timeline.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Including Background Music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Let’s Play!</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.</p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with the default arrangements, you can also proceed to make adjustments in the transition play duration and even customize a transition style of your own with text and effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Playing the Presentation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Adjust Your Image Properties</strong></p>
<p>To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.</p>
<p>For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.</p>
<p>You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adjusting Image Properties"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Add Suitable Transitions</strong></p>
<p>If the randomly included transitions of the slideshow program do not suit your presentation style, choose to add your preferred one from the software’s ‘Transition Library’ and tap the ‘Adjust’ button to customise the properties of your selection. You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Transitions"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Text Customizations</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Images’ menu and hit the ‘Text’ tab to include text add-on within the slideshow images while formatting them suitably. You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button. To present a combined play of text and image, while avoiding the separate text animation, click on the ‘Show Text with Image’ checkbox at the bottom right corner of the ‘Images’ menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Add Comments to the Images</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Sound’ tab and enable your system’s microphone to add recorded comments to your slideshow. Start with clicking on the ‘Record’ button and narrate the comment. Don’t worry about the sync of image and comment play durations as the software program will automatically adjust both to be in line with each other.</p>
<p>If you are interested to add a particular sound file to a specific image, navigate to the ‘Yellow Folder’ at the top right corner to make your selection.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Image Comments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10: Adding Effects to the Images</strong></p>
<p>To complement the images of your <strong>Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate 12</strong> presentation with stunning images, navigate to the toolbar at the bottom of the editing workspace and click on the ‘Image Effects’ icon. To add the effect, drag it to a desired image in the project timeline. When you have reached the right place, drop the effect to apply it. To see the effect preview, navigate to the ‘Layout Designer Panel’ at the left, where you can find your image with the chosen effect.</p>

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Image Effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Collage Creation</strong></p>
<p>Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.</p>
<p>Move ahead with expanding the collage, to ensure a proper display of the images. You can further, apply selected transitions to the created collage under the latter’s ‘Object Settings’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Creating an Image Collage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 12: Edit Your Collage</strong></p>
<p>Start with selecting the first image of your collage and adjusting its size in the ‘Layout Designer’ through the position frame at the edges of the photo. Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.</p>
<p>Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Editing the Collage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 13: Including a Chapter</strong></p>
<p>If you are not satisfied with a single image track, proceed to add chapters to your presentation. Start with selecting the ‘Chapter’ object from the ‘Object Toolbar’ to insert the former in the timeline, followed by dragging 2 images into the same. Tap the ‘Play’ button to open the chapter and add suitable text and animation to it in similar way as you would do for a collage. Position the images at the desired place using the red ‘Position Bar’.</p>

Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.</p>
<p>Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.</p>
<p>Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>custom slide show</strong> creation process with the finest details:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Tool</strong></p>
<p>Start the <strong>custom slide show PowerPoint</strong> creation process with launching the PowerPoint tool in any of your preferred devices. It would be better to work on a desktop or a PC. Proceed to open the presentation that you wish to create a custom slideshow from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Custom Slide Show Option</strong></p>
<p>In the welcome interface of PowerPoint, navigate to the ribbon at the top and hit the ‘Slide Show’ tab, followed by clicking on the ‘Custom Slide Show’ button from the ‘Options Panel’ that appears. As you tap the aforesaid button, a dropdown menu follows next, from where you need to choose the ‘Custom Shows…’ option.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Custom Shows Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>The completion of Step 2 brings up the ‘Custom Shows’ dialog box, with a blank area at the left, indicating the absence of any custom slide show as yet. To create one, navigate to and click on the ‘New’ button at the right side within the dialog box.</p>

<p>As you tap the ‘New’ button, the ‘Define Custom Shows’ dialog box pops up with a display of the following fields and buttons:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slide Show Name Box</strong></p>
<p>Use this field to assign a name to your custom slideshow. In case you don’t add a name of your choice, PowerPoint will assign the name ‘Custom Show 1’ to your custom presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slides in Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Below the ‘Slide Show Name’ box, appears a list of slides in the chosen presentation which you can use to create the custom slide show. To add slides to the same, click on the respective slide names.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add Button</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Add’ button in the middle of the ‘Define Custom Show’ dialog box is used to include selected slides from the main list explained above to the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list at the right. The ‘Add’ button however, remains disabled until you make a selection from the main slides list to include within the custom slides list. Take note that you can choose to repeat the slides within the custom list.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Remove Button</strong></p>
<p>You can use this button to select and delete specific slides from the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list. The button however, remains disabled till you make a slide selection to be removed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slides in Custom Show</strong></p>
<p>This is a list of slides that you have selected from the main slides list to include in the custom slideshow.</p>

<p>These are ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ arrows at the right side of the ‘Define Custom Show’ dialog box, which are active only if the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list has more than one slide to its credit. In such a case, you can use these arrows to change the sequence of appearance of the slides within the custom presentation.</p>

<p><strong>How to Set a Custom Show as the Default Slideshow?</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in playing the custom show as a default presentation, see through the following stepwise tutorial guide to go ahead with the process:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Set Up Slideshow Button</strong></p>
<p>After you have launched the parent presentation, navigate to and click on the ‘Slide Show’ tab within the topmost PowerPoint ribbon and tap the ‘Set Up Slide Show’ button from the list of options that follows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up Show Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>Clicking on the aforesaid button makes the ‘Set Up Show’ dialog box to appear, where you are required to hit the ‘Custom Show’ radio button. You can now click on the dropdown arrow below the radio buttons to select your specific one from the list of custom shows that pops down. Hit ‘OK’ at the bottom right corner of the dialog box when you have made your choice.</p>

                      alt="Default Custom Slide Show- ‘Set Up Show&#39; Dialog Box"
                ></p>
<p>The custom show is now your default slideshow. In your future launches of ‘Slide Show View’, only the selected custom show slides will appear to be used as a presentation.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Hide-Slides-in-PowerPoint-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Hide-Slides-in-PowerPoint-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Hide Slides in PowerPoint?"></a>Part 3 How to Hide Slides in PowerPoint?</h2><p>In case you have worked on a detailed slideshow presentation in the PowerPoint tool, that consists of selective contents for different audience groups, all within the main presentation, it is a wise step to hide the content slides that are not useful to particular audiences, lest your viewers might get distracted with the irrelevant content.</p>
<p>By far, you must have developed a significant understanding of the <strong>custom slideshow PowerPoint</strong> creation and presentation procedure in much detail. Moving further into our discussion, let us now work on hiding slides within a PowerPoint presentation through the following step by step guide:</p>
<p><strong>How to Hide or Unhide a Slide in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Start with opening a desired PowerPoint Presentation in your preferred device.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Selection</strong></p>
<p>Visit the slide navigation pane at the left to select slide you wish to delete. Your selections will be highlighted as you tap on them. You can either delete the slides one at a time, or make multiple selections to delete them all at once.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-custom-slide-show-in-powerpoint-10.JPG"
                      alt="Hiding Presentation Slides- Slide Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Hide Slide Option</strong></p>
<p>When you have made the required selections, right click on the same, followed by choosing the ‘Hide Slide’ option from the dropdown menu that appears next. The selected slides will now be hidden and you can recognize them in the ‘Presenter View’ with lighter thumbnails as compared to the included slides, in the slide navigation pane.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Hiding Presentation Slides- Hidden Slide"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Unhiding the Presentation Slides</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to unhide a previously hidden presentation slide, reach to the slide navigation pane in the left and right click on the hidden slide thumbnail. The dropdown menu in Step 3 pops up again, and you need to tap on the ‘Hide Slide’ option. The selected slide will now be included in the presentation.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-custom-slide-show-in-powerpoint-13.JPG"
                      alt="Unhiding Presentation Slides- ‘Hide Slide&#39; Option"
                ></p>
<p>An alternative to show a hidden slide within a running presentation, while remaining in the ‘Presenter View’, make a random right click anywhere within the currently running slide. The ‘Options Panel’ pops up, and you are required to choose the ‘See All Slides’ option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-custom-slide-show-in-powerpoint-14.JPG"
                      alt="Unhiding Presentation Slides- ‘See All Slides&#39; Option"
                ></p>
<p>All the slides of your presentation will now get displayed in the slide navigation pane, with the hidden ones being grayed out with a crossed slide number. Click on the thumbnail of the respective hidden slides that you want to present before the audience.</p>

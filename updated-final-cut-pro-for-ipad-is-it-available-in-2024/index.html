<ul>
<li>Take the original height-for example, 2400 units.</li>
<li>Take the actual width- for example, 3200 units.</li>
<li>Then, divide the height by width- for example, 2400&#x2F;3200&#x3D;0.75.</li>
<li>Multiply the result (quotient) by new expected width- for instance, 0.75*600&#x3D;450.</li>

<ul>
<li>Take the original height-for example, 2400 units.</li>
<li>Take the actual width- for example, 3200 units.</li>
<li>Then, divide the height by width- for example, 2400&#x2F;3200&#x3D;0.75.</li>

<ul>
<li>Take the original height-for example, 2400 units.</li>
<li>Take the actual width- for example, 3200 units.</li>
<li>Then, divide the height by width- for example, 2400&#x2F;3200&#x3D;0.75.</li>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>
<p><strong>2 Ways to Merge&#x2F;Combine Xvid Files on Android using Wave.video (paid software)</strong></p>
<p>Wave.video allows you to easily combine two or more video clips or images to create longer videos.</p>
<p>To do this, go to https: &#x2F;&#x2F;wave.video, click the New Video button and select Blank Video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Place the video &#x2F;photo in the desired order.</strong></p>
<p>Think about which clips are next to each other and work best, and arrange them accordingly. You can drag clips to rearrange them and delete them when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>In the menu on the left, you can choose the format of the finished video (choose 1: 1 (square)), whether to crop the video (choose Fit to Border), and the length.</p>

<p>Drag both ends of the layer to change the timing of the start and end of the clip, or click the timing and use the arrow keys to make fine adjustments.</p>
<p>Besides trimming, you can look at other edits. To remove a section or add a clip in the center, use the split tool above the timeline or type “s” on your keyboard and use the shortcut.</p>
<p>Next, delete the layers you no longer need, drag the clips to combine them, and display them side by side on the timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning"><a href="#03Practical-Learning" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning"><a href="#04Combined-Learning" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-1"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-1"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-1" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-1"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-1" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive.

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-2"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-2" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-2"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-2"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-2"><a href="#05Affordable-2" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>

The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-2"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-2" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-3"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-3"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-3" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-3"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-3"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-3" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-3"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-3" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-3"><a href="#05Affordable-3" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-3"><a href="#Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples"></a>Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples</h2><p>Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, <strong>AR classrooms</strong> have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-3"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-3" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

<h3 id="03Distance-Learning-With-Mondly-3"><a href="#03Distance-Learning-With-Mondly-3" class="headerlink" title="03Distance Learning With Mondly"></a>03Distance Learning With Mondly</h3><p>Mondly is a language learning platform that’s designed to help students learn different languages in an interactive manner. With the platform, users get a dedicated virtual assistant that helps them work on their skills more effectively. The app replicates real-life settings in many ways and users can get a strong grasp on the desired language.</p>

<h3 id="04Froggipedia-3"><a href="#04Froggipedia-3" class="headerlink" title="04Froggipedia"></a>04Froggipedia</h3><p>This is where things get interesting. Froggipedia is a great example of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong>. It’s basically a smartphone app that lets users explore the internal organs of a frog in a virtual environment. It means students would no longer have to get involved in the mess that dissecting an actual frog creates in the classroom and still get familiar with each organ easily.</p>

<h3 id="05Effective-Marketing-3"><a href="#05Effective-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="05Effective Marketing"></a>05Effective Marketing</h3><p>Another example of <strong>Augmented Reality in the teaching</strong> world has nothing to do with learning, but the marketing aspect of the industry. With AR-based platforms, universities and colleges can market their brands among the target consumers and get a higher number of applications in return. They can launch digital publications and AR-powered videos to maximize engagement and achieve the desired results through their marketing campaigns.</p>

<h3 id="06Virtual-Classrooms-3"><a href="#06Virtual-Classrooms-3" class="headerlink" title="06Virtual Classrooms"></a>06Virtual Classrooms</h3><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of virtual classrooms as many schools still haven’t resumed physical classes to restrict the virus’s spread. In VR classrooms, mixed reality - a combination of VR and AR - can help students stay engaged, even if they are sitting apart from each other. Virtual Classrooms will eliminate boredom from remote learning and keep the engagement level high for students.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="07Secure-Training-3"><a href="#07Secure-Training-3" class="headerlink" title="07Secure Training"></a>07Secure Training</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, AR integration makes training more effective and risk-free. For example, with Microsoft Holo-lens, medical students understand the inner anatomy of the human body and understand complex procedures without having to risk a patient’s life. Once they are confident and know about each organ, they can move towards the next procedure and gain expertise in the particular domain more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="08Google-Expeditions-3"><a href="#08Google-Expeditions-3" class="headerlink" title="08Google Expeditions"></a>08Google Expeditions</h3><p>For a student, exploring the world is a great way to familiarize himself with different cultures. But, it’s not always possible for young kids to go on trips alone. Well, not anymore! Thanks to virtual tour platforms like Google Expeditions, teachers can take their students on virtual trips to different corners of the world, be it Mount Everest Base Camp or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</p>

<h3 id="09Augmented-Reality-in-Museums-3"><a href="#09Augmented-Reality-in-Museums-3" class="headerlink" title="09Augmented Reality in Museums"></a>09Augmented Reality in Museums</h3><p>The younger generation craves interactivity. They don’t have the time to read brochures in a Museum. That’s the reason why many Museums have started to launch AR-powered tech to keep the visitors engaged and let them learn various historical facts more precisely. For instance, in a nature-themed museum, visitors can experience digital animals and their position in history.</p>
<h3 id="10Virtual-Speech-3"><a href="#10Virtual-Speech-3" class="headerlink" title="10Virtual Speech"></a>10Virtual Speech</h3><p>Not particularly an Augmented Reality (AR) example, Virtual Speech is a combination of AR and VR that lets users virtually practice their public speaking skills without going on a real stage. This is a great tool to fight stage fear and speak with confidence in front of an actual crowd.</p>

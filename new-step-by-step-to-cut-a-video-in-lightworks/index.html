In this article, we will take a look at the software Lightworks and learn how to cut videos using it.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will cover the cutting of videos in Lightworks. We will talk about what Lightworks is and how to download it. We’ll also cover the general interface so you know which buttons do what. Finally, we’ll talk about exporting a finished video and getting started with your next project in Lightworks!</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Lightworks"><a href="#What-is-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="What is Lightworks?"></a>What is Lightworks?</h2><p>Lightworks is an editing software created by a company called Lightworks. It’s a free video editor that is incredibly powerful and has been used to edit some of the most popular films of recent years.</p>
<p>The software was originally designed for professional filmmakers, but it’s now available for anyone to use for any type of project. You can download Lightworks from the website here - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lightworks.com/" >https://www.lightworks.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Downloading-the-Software"><a href="#Downloading-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Downloading the Software"></a>Downloading the Software</h2><p>First, download the Lightworks software from the website. You can do this by clicking on the big green button that says “Download the Latest Version”. When you click on it, you’ll be prompted to select your operating system and download the appropriate package.</p>
<p>Click “Next” and you’ll see a license agreement and a prompt for installation details. Fill in your information and click “Next” again to start your installation.</p>
<p>When installation is complete, launch Lightworks by double-clicking on the Lightworks icon in your files section.</p>
<p>The first time you open Lightworks, you’ll need to go through a few steps of initializing before using it for editing videos. This includes setting up your project settings and choosing whether or not to keep a backup of your previous work.</p>
<p>We will cover these initial steps separately in future blog posts, so don’t worry if it’s all unclear right now!</p>
<h2 id="The-Interface"><a href="#The-Interface" class="headerlink" title="The Interface"></a>The Interface</h2><p>New users to the software will notice that there are four different windows. The first window is the Project window. This window shows you all of the footage you have loaded into your project, as well as any clips you’ve added to your project (see below) and edits you’ve made.

The following are the simple actions you’ll need to do to get started:</p>
<p>Step 1: First and foremost, you must import your movie into Lightworks. The simplest way to do this is to drag the clip you wish to work with onto the timeline:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After you’ve uploaded your clips to the timeline, you’ll be able to begin trimming them. To do so, simply slide the play head to the point where you wish to cut the clip and press the “C” key on your keyboard:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After you’ve cut the part you need, you’ll need to erase the rest. To do so, use your mouse to select the part you don’t want to erase, then use your mouse to pick the “Delete” option, or just click the “delete” button on your keyboard:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: When you’re finished, right-click the “ALL” option in the lower-left corner of the Timeline and select “Export” from the menu that appears:</p>
<p><img

You can then move it around by dragging it back and forth along the timeline until you’ve created an appropriate cut point. Selecting a cut point is as easy as clicking and dragging on the time bar on the right side of the screen, which will let you set precise points of cuts anywhere in your video timeline!</p>

<p>Step 5: In order to cut a video, select a section of the timeline by clicking on it with your mouse. You can then move it around by dragging it back and forth along the timeline until you’ve created an appropriate cut point. Selecting a cut point is as easy as clicking and dragging on the time bar on the right side of the screen, which will let you set precise points of cuts anywhere in your video timeline!</p>

But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.</p>

Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.</p>

If you have already downloaded the Wondershare Filmora. Open it, and let’s start editing the video.</p>
<p>Step2 First, we need to find a photo of a white paper that you can easily download from the internet and two videos in which you want to add this effect. Then import these three files to the media gallery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-02.png"
                      alt="select the material"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag and drop <strong>Clip 1</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the last frame of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-03.png"
                      alt="drag-drop clip 1"
                ></p>
<p>Alt text: Paper rip effect.</p>
<p>Step4 Now right-click on <strong>Clip 1</strong> to open the menu and select <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-04.png"
                      alt="selecting add freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 After adding a freeze frame, cut here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-05.png"
                      alt="adding a cut"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline, and make sure it starts at the cut on the first video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-06.png"
                      alt="dropping paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Double-click the paper picture on the timeline to open the settings window and then open the <strong>Compositing</strong> menu. Then Change the <strong>Blending Mode</strong> from Normal to <strong>Multiply</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-07.png"
                      alt="opening compositing menu"
                ></p>
<p>In the preview window, we can see that the freeze frame has the paper texture now!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-08.png"
                      alt="freeze frame has a paper texture"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press <strong>“I”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>IN POINT</strong>, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press <strong>“O”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>OUT POINT</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-09.png"
                      alt="setting the in point"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.</p>
<p>Step9 Then click <strong>Export</strong> and choose <strong>Create Video</strong>. Let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and click on Export.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png"
                      alt="selecting create a video"
                ></p>
<p>It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the timeline and <strong>Cancel</strong> the selected range.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-011.png"
                      alt="exporting the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step10 Import the <strong>Freeze Frame 1</strong> to the media folder and replace the <strong>Freeze Frame + Paper Photo</strong> with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step11 Now let’s make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop <strong>Clip 2</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip’s first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the <strong>Alt+F</strong> keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a <strong>Cut</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-013.png"
                      alt="adding clip 2 to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png"
                      alt="adding paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting <strong>IN and OUT</strong> points as we did before. Press the <strong>I</strong> key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the <strong>O</strong> key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-015.png"
                      alt="selecting in and out points"
                ></p>
<p>Step14 This time use the shortcut <strong>Control + E</strong> to open the export window. Again, let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> and then export it.</p>
<p>Step15 You can use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Shift + X</strong> to cancel the selected range. Then import <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> into the media folder and replace the freeze frame + paper photo. Adjust the length of this new clip to about 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-016.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the <strong>Transitions window</strong> and find Evaporate 2.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-017.png"
                      alt="select the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between <strong>clip 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and the cut between <strong>clip 2</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. You can also adjust the length of the transition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-018.png"
                      alt="dropping the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step18 Then, find <strong>Torned Paper Transition 4</strong> in the <strong>Transitions window</strong>. Drag and drop it to the cut between <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. Then choose <strong>Prefix</strong> mode in the transition setting video. Adjust the length if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-019.gif"
                      alt="dropping another transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, it’s done. Let’s play the video and see how the paper effect and transitions enhanced the video.</p>

<p>Alt text: Paper rip effect.</p>
<p>Step4 Now right-click on <strong>Clip 1</strong> to open the menu and select <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>.</p>

                      alt="selecting add freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 After adding a freeze frame, cut here.</p>

<p>Step6 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline, and make sure it starts at the cut on the first video track.</p>

                      alt="dropping paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Double-click the paper picture on the timeline to open the settings window and then open the <strong>Compositing</strong> menu. Then Change the <strong>Blending Mode</strong> from Normal to <strong>Multiply</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="opening compositing menu"
                ></p>
<p>In the preview window, we can see that the freeze frame has the paper texture now!</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press <strong>“I”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>IN POINT</strong>, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press <strong>“O”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>OUT POINT</strong>.</p>

                      alt="setting the in point"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.</p>
<p>Step9 Then click <strong>Export</strong> and choose <strong>Create Video</strong>. Let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and click on Export.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png"
                      alt="selecting create a video"
                ></p>
<p>It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the timeline and <strong>Cancel</strong> the selected range.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-011.png"
                      alt="exporting the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step10 Import the <strong>Freeze Frame 1</strong> to the media folder and replace the <strong>Freeze Frame + Paper Photo</strong> with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step11 Now let’s make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop <strong>Clip 2</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip’s first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the <strong>Alt+F</strong> keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a <strong>Cut</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-013.png"
                      alt="adding clip 2 to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting <strong>IN and OUT</strong> points as we did before. Press the <strong>I</strong> key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the <strong>O</strong> key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-015.png"
                      alt="selecting in and out points"
                ></p>
<p>Step14 This time use the shortcut <strong>Control + E</strong> to open the export window. Again, let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> and then export it.</p>
<p>Step15 You can use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Shift + X</strong> to cancel the selected range. Then import <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> into the media folder and replace the freeze frame + paper photo. Adjust the length of this new clip to about 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-016.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the <strong>Transitions window</strong> and find Evaporate 2.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-017.png"
                      alt="select the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between <strong>clip 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and the cut between <strong>clip 2</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. You can also adjust the length of the transition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-018.png"
                      alt="dropping the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step18 Then, find <strong>Torned Paper Transition 4</strong> in the <strong>Transitions window</strong>. Drag and drop it to the cut between <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. Then choose <strong>Prefix</strong> mode in the transition setting video. Adjust the length if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-019.gif"
                      alt="dropping another transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, it’s done. Let’s play the video and see how the paper effect and transitions enhanced the video.</p>

Even though you are not a complete stranger to the term 4K, you might still be unaware of what it means.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, 4K is the highest resolution you can watch your movies and videos. The details are incredibly crisp, meaning you can see pimples or the pores on an actor’s face through the screen. However, the frame rate will significantly affect how you enjoy a 4K video. Therefore, it would be wise to learn how to choose the ideal frame rate to suit your needs.</p>
<p>Keep reading this article to learn more about frame rates and which is suitable for a 4K video.</p>

<h2 id="How-Do-Frame-Rates-Affect-Video-Viewing"><a href="#How-Do-Frame-Rates-Affect-Video-Viewing" class="headerlink" title="How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?"></a>How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?</h2><p>The motion will appear smoother if your video contains more frames per second. Even though your viewers are not tech-savvy, they will definitely notice the difference.</p>
<p>Consider a video of a duck drinking water from a pond. If you film and playback the same video in 24, 30, and 60fps, you will see a noticeable difference, assuming your shutter speed is set according to the 180-degree shutter rule.</p>
<p>If you are filming quicker motions of wildlife and birds, you are better off sticking to higher resolutions to give the viewer a pleasant experience and ensure the motion is fluid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lower frame rates like 24fps are ideal for human movements, which are not as smooth as wildlife. Suppose you used 60fps for a cinematic film or a TV show. The video would look a bit odd because that is not how we see things in the natural world. In addition, your viewers aren’t used to such smoothness.</p>
<h2 id="Viewing-Requirements-of-4K-Videos"><a href="#Viewing-Requirements-of-4K-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos"></a>Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos</h2><p>You may have heard about 4K videos and wondered what people mean by that term. In simple terms, a 4K video is a high-resolution video that is four times the usual 1080p HD video. When it comes to 4K videos, there are two standard resolutions. One of them is the standard for Digital Cinema which is 4096*2160 pixels. The other is for television and is 3840*2160 pixels.</p>
<p>To stream 4K content, you need a bandwidth between 10 and 20 Mbps. On the other hand, streaming platforms like Netflix require higher bandwidths of not less than 15 Mbps. In addition to the bandwidth we mentioned earlier, you need a 4KTV or 4K monitor.</p>
<p>This specification was brought up at the UHD Alliance, a union of more than 50 tech companies working together to support 4K content. Tech companies ought to ensure the devices they produce are compatible with 4K videos, which are becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Below is a list of requirements any electronic device should fulfill before being termed a 4KTV or 4K monitor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-requirements.jpg"
                      alt="requirements of 4k videos"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>A resolution of not less than 3840*2160.</li>
<li>A 10-bit color depth that allows for 1,024 shades of red, yellow, and blue.</li>
<li>A high dynamic range for color accuracy.</li>
<li>An excellent combination of black level and peak brightness. The peak brightness should not exceed 1,000 nits, and the black level shouldn’t go below 0.5 nits. Alternatively, the peak brightness shouldn’t exceed 540 nits; neither should the black level plummet below 0.0005 nits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Video"><a href="#Best-Frame-Rate-for-4K-Video" class="headerlink" title="Best Frame Rate for 4K Video"></a>Best Frame Rate for 4K Video</h2><p>We all know that the frame rate you choose for your video will significantly impact the viewer’s experience and the overall style of your video. The frame rate will also affect how the video looks. For instance, a frame rate lower than 24fps will make your video look unprofessional and of poor quality. The content will also flicker because there aren’t many still images per second.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a lower FPS causes the file size to be smaller, causing it to consume a lower bandwidth. The vice versa is also true. Now that you understand these facts, you might wonder which frame rate would be best for your 4K videos.</p>
<p>Research reveals that the most acceptable frame rate is 30fps and 60fps. This is because the motion will appear natural to the human eye without being too fast or unrealistic.</p>
<p>If you are wondering what is the best frame rate for 4k videos, we urge you to select 60fps because it contains more detail. The higher frame rate also makes the motion look very smooth and crisp. Perhaps you want to shoot a slow-motion video. In that case, an even higher frame rate of 120fps would be ideal.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Choose-The-Base-Frame-Rates-for-Your-Next-Video"><a href="#How-To-Choose-The-Base-Frame-Rates-for-Your-Next-Video" class="headerlink" title="How To Choose The Base Frame Rates for Your Next Video"></a>How To Choose The Base Frame Rates for Your Next Video</h2><p>Choosing a frame rate for your videos is not complicated. However, it is not a straightforward process either. There are numerous moving parts that ought to work harmoniously for your video to turn out perfect and guarantee your audience will have a pleasant viewing experience. Before we dive into choosing the best frame rate for your 4K videos, let’s help you understand the filmmaking process.</p>
<p>Most filmmakers and videographers see it fit to shoot videos in 120p or 4K. This step makes their work easier during the editing process. If the raw footage is in 4K, they can de-emphasize or retain specific plot points that would look great in the final video. However, not everyone is shooting a video for Hollywood. Therefore, shooting in 4K on your laptop for your YouTube channel might be difficult.</p>
<p>Below are some factors you should consider when choosing the best frame rate for a 4k video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="factors for choosing frame rate for videos"
                ></p>
<h4 id="File-size"><a href="#File-size" class="headerlink" title="File size"></a>File size</h4><p>Shooting your video at a higher frame rate means more still images are packed into a single second of the video. Therefore, you will end up with a larger file size. If you want to shoot a video for your YouTube channel, it would be wise to stick to a smaller frame rate.</p>
<h4 id="Purpose"><a href="#Purpose" class="headerlink" title="Purpose"></a>Purpose</h4><p>It wouldn’t make sense to shoot a talking head video at more than 24fps. However, a higher frame rate would be ideal for a travel vlog, where the details need to be crisp.</p>
<h4 id="Medium-of-delivery"><a href="#Medium-of-delivery" class="headerlink" title="Medium of delivery"></a>Medium of delivery</h4><p>The standard frame rate for television is 24fps. On the other hand, it would be best to stick to a higher frame rate of 60fps if you intend to shoot content for the silver screen.</p>
<h4 id="Motion-in-the-video"><a href="#Motion-in-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Motion in the video"></a>Motion in the video</h4><p>Lastly, the movement within the video will play a massive role in the frame rate you choose. The faster the motion, the higher the frame rate needs to be. For instance, action movies don’t do well in frame rates of less than 60 fps.</p>

<h2 id="Adjust-the-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Adjust-the-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the aspect ratio"></a>Adjust the aspect ratio</h2><p>The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.</p>
<p>You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won’t shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you’ll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.</p>

If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let’s suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> 3424 pixels wide <strong>x</strong> 1 high &#x2F; 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)</p>

<h2 id="Send-your-first-draft"><a href="#Send-your-first-draft" class="headerlink" title="Send your first draft"></a>Send your first draft</h2><p>The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.</p>
<p>Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.</p>
<p>For first drafts, you don’t need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.</p>

<li>Click on <strong>Effects</strong> and search for <strong>Timecode</strong> in the search bar.</li>
<li>Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.</li>
<li>Extend the timer to the end of the video.</li>
<li>Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.</li>

<p>Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.</p>

By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.</p>
<p>These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.</p>

<h5 id="Step3Add-the-title-1"><a href="#Step3Add-the-title-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3Add the title"></a>Step3Add the title</h5><p>Once you arrange all shots in order, you can add the title of your music video. Click on the <strong>Titles</strong>, then choose your desired style and add the name of your music video in the title box. You can also change the text’s size, font, and color.</p>

<h5 id="Step4Flip-the-clip-1"><a href="#Step4Flip-the-clip-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4Flip the clip"></a>Step4Flip the clip</h5><p>One last thing is, if you shot any scene in mirror-image format, you can flip it. Click on the clip you want to flip and select the flip icon in the video properties.</p>

<h2 id="Send-your-first-draft-1"><a href="#Send-your-first-draft-1" class="headerlink" title="Send your first draft"></a>Send your first draft</h2><p>The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.</p>
<p>Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.</p>
<p>For first drafts, you don’t need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-add-the-timer-in-the-music-video-1"><a href="#How-to-add-the-timer-in-the-music-video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to add the timer in the music video?"></a>How to add the timer in the music video?</h3><ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Effects</strong> and search for <strong>Timecode</strong> in the search bar.</li>
<li>Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.</li>
<li>Extend the timer to the end of the video.</li>
<li>Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-timer.gif"
                      alt="adding timer"
                ></p>
<p>Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this blog has helped you edit the initials of your music video. By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.</p>
<p>These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.</p>

Obviously, it’ll be a treat for you!</p>
<p>Planning and preparing before the shoot is the key to making a music video successful. You can only achieve this after location scouting and emerging with the best one. And scheduling for big projects before the day is more important. Let’s directly move towards the things to consider before shooting!</p>
<h2 id="Location-scouting"><a href="#Location-scouting" class="headerlink" title="Location scouting"></a>Location scouting</h2><p>The pleasant and eye-catchy location always makes your music video trending or flopping. You should first go with your budget and then come up with location ideas. In the upcoming tip, we will use 3lau’s song “Tokyo” as an example.</p>

                      alt="finding the right location for the music video"
                ></p>
<p>If you are going with large projects, you need to consider the following requirements!</p>
<h3 id="1-Availability-of-electricity"><a href="#1-Availability-of-electricity" class="headerlink" title="1. Availability of electricity"></a>1. Availability of electricity</h3><p>You need rig lights and a large lighting setup to make your video more glow and give them aesthetic vibes. For this, make sure you choose a location where light is readily available.</p>
<h3 id="2-Separate-room"><a href="#2-Separate-room" class="headerlink" title="2. Separate room"></a>2. Separate room</h3><p>During shooting for big projects, you need room to store all gear and sensitive equipment in one place for many days.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="separate room to store gears"
                ></p>
<h3 id="3-Check-the-size"><a href="#3-Check-the-size" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the size"></a>3. Check the size</h3><p>The foremost thing in choosing the location is to check the Height and Width of the studio. They should be enough to rig the lights in the studio easily and place every required thing in a decided space.</p>
<p>For Example, while shooting a 3lau song, there is a need for a bus to come into the studio easily, but there is an issue in entering the bus due to height issues of the door. Due to this, the director changed the location at the spot to sort out this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>On day 1 of the Tokyo song, the filming is done in two halves; the first half day goes towards filming everything in the bus, and the other half day, there is a shoot of everything outside the bus.</p>

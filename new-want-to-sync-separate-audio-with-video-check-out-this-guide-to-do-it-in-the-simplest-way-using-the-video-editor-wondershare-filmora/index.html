Check Out This Guide to Do It in the Simplest Way Using the Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora"></a>Want to Sync Separate Audio with Video? Check Out This Guide to Do It in the Simplest Way Using the Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it’s not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.</p>
<p>That’s why in this brief guide, we’ll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio &amp; video when a single camera can record both. So let’s first answer this simple question.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-We-Need-to-Sync-Separate-Audio-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-We-Need-to-Sync-Separate-Audio-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio &amp; Video?"></a>Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio &amp; Video?</h2><p>Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can’t expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That’s why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.</p>
<p>You might think it’s an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg"
                      alt="recording audio and video separately for higher quality"
                ></p>
<p>But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don’t do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn’t it?</p>
<p>Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let’s first see what preparations we need. After that, we’ll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let’s begin our journey.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Preparation-for-Syncing-Audio-With-Video-During-Recording"><a href="#Part-2-Preparation-for-Syncing-Audio-With-Video-During-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording"></a>Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording</h2><p>You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It’s to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.</p>
<p>And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/film-start-clapper-board.jpg"
                      alt="a clapper board used to start a film scene"
                ></p>
<p>Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It’s best to clap before you say “Action” or speak so that it’s easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a <strong>Tail Slate</strong>!!!</p>
<p>After you’ve recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world’s leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let’s move forward and see how to sync audio with video using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p>As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let’s start with the manual process first.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Manually-Sync-Audio-With-Video-Using-Filmora"><a href="#Steps-To-Manually-Sync-Audio-With-Video-Using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora"></a>Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora</h3><h5 id="Step1Download-install"><a href="#Step1Download-install" class="headerlink" title="Step1Download &amp; install"></a>Step1Download &amp; install</h5><p>If you haven’t downloaded the latest version of Filmora yet, click the button below to download it without any cost.

<h5 id="Step2Import-your-files"><a href="#Step2Import-your-files" class="headerlink" title="Step2Import your files"></a>Step2Import your files</h5><p>The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the “New Project” button from the opening interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-a-new-project-on-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="click on the new project"
                ></p>
<p>When a new project is created, you’ll see an “Import Media” section on it. Click on this section to browse your audio and video files from the computer. Or you can also drag and drop these files here to import them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="import your media files"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3Prepare-your-files"><a href="#Step3Prepare-your-files" class="headerlink" title="Step3Prepare your files"></a>Step3Prepare your files</h5><p>Now, it’s time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the “Import Media” section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag the media files to the timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step4Sync-the-audio-video-files-using-the-audio-spike"><a href="#Step4Sync-the-audio-video-files-using-the-audio-spike" class="headerlink" title="Step4Sync the audio &amp; video files using the audio spike"></a>Step4Sync the audio &amp; video files using the audio spike</h5><p>Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you’ll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we’ll see a spike.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bonus Tip:</em></strong> <em>If you can’t find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier.</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg"
                      alt="find the sound spike on video and audio files"
                ></p>
<p>Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="align the sound spikes with each other"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let’s see how to do it now.</p>
<h5 id="Step5Remove-the-audio-from-the-video-footage"><a href="#Step5Remove-the-audio-from-the-video-footage" class="headerlink" title="Step5Remove the audio from the video footage"></a>Step5Remove the audio from the video footage</h5><p>To detach the audio in the video footage, right-click on this file and select the “Detach Audio” option. Or you can also use the “Ctrl+Alt+D” as the hotkey.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="detach audio from video file"
                ></p>
<p>Once the audio file has been separated, you can move forward and delete it. To delete this audio, right-click on it and select “Delete.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let’s start with the manual process first.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Manually-Sync-Audio-With-Video-Using-Filmora-1"><a href="#Steps-To-Manually-Sync-Audio-With-Video-Using-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora"></a>Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora</h3><h5 id="Step1Download-install-1"><a href="#Step1Download-install-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Download &amp; install"></a>Step1Download &amp; install</h5><p>If you haven’t downloaded the latest version of Filmora yet, click the button below to download it without any cost.

<h5 id="Step2Import-your-files-1"><a href="#Step2Import-your-files-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2Import your files"></a>Step2Import your files</h5><p>The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the “New Project” button from the opening interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-a-new-project-on-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="click on the new project"
                ></p>
<p>When a new project is created, you’ll see an “Import Media” section on it. Click on this section to browse your audio and video files from the computer. Or you can also drag and drop these files here to import them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="import your media files"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3Prepare-your-files-1"><a href="#Step3Prepare-your-files-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3Prepare your files"></a>Step3Prepare your files</h5><p>Now, it’s time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the “Import Media” section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we’ll see a spike.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bonus Tip:</em></strong> <em>If you can’t find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier.</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="find the sound spike on video and audio files"
                ></p>
<p>Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="align the sound spikes with each other"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let’s see how to do it now.</p>
<h5 id="Step5Remove-the-audio-from-the-video-footage-1"><a href="#Step5Remove-the-audio-from-the-video-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Remove the audio from the video footage"></a>Step5Remove the audio from the video footage</h5><p>To detach the audio in the video footage, right-click on this file and select the “Detach Audio” option. Or you can also use the “Ctrl+Alt+D” as the hotkey.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="detach audio from video file"
                ></p>
<p>Once the audio file has been separated, you can move forward and delete it. To delete this audio, right-click on it and select “Delete.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

But you don’t have to worry about it anymore let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>What are you planning to use it for?</strong>: You must know the use of video editing software before picking one. Whether you are using it for gaming or creating ordinary YouTube videos. These decisions are very important to take before opting for downloading it from the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: You should keep in mind which editing software is complex to learn and which one is easy in comparison with that. If you didn’t keep this in mind you might end up wasting your time by downloading and trying in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>
<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-1"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p><strong>What do most YouTubers use to record their screen?</strong></p>

<p>Your screen record quality can get ruined only when you use a screen recorder that records at a lower resolution due to its inability as well as to reduce file size.

But you don’t have to worry about it anymore let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>What are you planning to use it for?</strong>: You must know the use of video editing software before picking one. Whether you are using it for gaming or creating ordinary YouTube videos. These decisions are very important to take before opting for downloading it from the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: You should keep in mind which editing software is complex to learn and which one is easy in comparison with that. If you didn’t keep this in mind you might end up wasting your time by downloading and trying in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>
<p>5. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>
<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-2"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software.

<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-3"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>

<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>

For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Go to the <strong>Edit &amp; Create</strong> option on the right corner on the top, and then select <strong>Add slo-mo</strong> option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for “<strong>Slow</strong>“ and “<strong>Super-Slow</strong>“ performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >created with slow motion effects on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.</p>
<p>Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the blue <strong>Import Selected</strong> button once you’ve selected the video file in the file browser to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may now open the movie in iMovie. Creating a <strong>Project</strong> is required at this stage. To do so, click on the Projects option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Once you’ve entered a name for your project, click the blue <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> By dragging the movie onto your timeline, you may modify the video. Select the video by clicking on it and clicking on the <strong>Speed</strong> option to change its speed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: The duration of your movie will be increased by halves the pace at which it was initially recorded. The video may be slowed down even further by moving the <strong><em>speed slider</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Go to the Menu Bar and choose <strong>File &gt; Share</strong>. Select the file you want to share.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9</strong>: Click the blue <strong>Next</strong> button once you’ve selected the properties you want for the file.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To add slow motion effect to part of the video, you need to split the video first and then right click it to choose <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Duration</strong>. There will be a pop-up window. The motion effects will be sped up or slowed down based on the speed values.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: click on the <strong>Choose File</strong> option from the website to upload the video (max. 200MB).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now select the <strong>Speed</strong> of the video from the given options. Since we are going to make a video with slow motion effect, choose 0.5x or 0.8x will work perfectly.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img

Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.</p>
<p>Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the <strong>Playback</strong> for <strong>Speed</strong> and choose a speed option: <em>slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback &gt; Speed menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video’s speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Launch Filmora video editor on your Windows or Mac computer (I’m running Windows 10 here). Click the New Project in the Startup window to create a new project in 16:9 aspect ratio by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="filmora startup window"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Import the video you want to add slow motion effect to the media library, and then drag and drop it to the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add video to slow motion filmora video editor"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> To add slow motion effect to part of the video, you need to split the video first and then right click it to choose <strong>Speed</strong> and <strong>Duration</strong>. There will be a pop-up window. The motion effects will be sped up or slowed down based on the speed values.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When you increase or decrease the video playing speed, the video audio speed changes. If you wish to retain the video audio’s actual playing speed, you may first <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Detach Audio</strong> from the video</a> and then edit the video to achieve a perfect pitch.</p>

                      alt="detach audio from video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Select <strong>Expor</strong>t after you’ve completed setting the video speed. By selecting <strong>Format</strong>, you may save the video in any significant format.</p>

It is simple to use and supports various video formats such as MP4, AVI, FLV, MOV, 3GP, MKV, WMV, M4V, and others. This tool can also change the video speed by increasing (speeding up) or decreasing (slowing down). The audio in the video file will also become faster or slower due to using this tool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: click on the <strong>Choose File</strong> option from the website to upload the video (max. 200MB).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now select the <strong>Speed</strong> of the video from the given options. Since we are going to make a video with slow motion effect, choose 0.5x or 0.8x will work perfectly.</p>

Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: <strong>Create A New Project</strong> on the CapCut app’s home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: When you’re ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the <strong>Mute clip audio</strong> button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-capcut.jpg"
                      alt=" mute video audio capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the <strong>Split</strong> button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the <strong>Speed</strong> menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg"
                      alt=" speed option in capcut"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>5:</strong> In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, <strong>Normal</strong> and <strong>Curve</strong>, respectively. You may just choose the “<strong>Normal</strong>“ option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video’s frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the <strong>Check</strong> box.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-capcut-normal.jpg"
                      alt=" change speed  in capcut"
                ></p>
<p>Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.</p>

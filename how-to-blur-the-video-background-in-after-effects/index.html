<p>It is definitely possible Usually, people use video collage makers for this reason. But you can also create an actual photo collage with music as well (no need to use actual video clips if you don’t want to.)</p>
<p>In the end, it all depends on the collage maker you’re using to be completely honest. In this case, the collage maker in question would have to have video editing functionalities advanced enough to allow you to create a video consisting of a picture collage with music Learn more about the different tools that you can check out below as we break down some of the best of the best available</p>
<h2 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="01 Wondershare Filmora Video Editor"></a>01 <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h2><p>The first of the video makers that we’re going to be introducing is called Filmora. This is a professional editor that’s equipped with just about everything you need for creating high-quality video content. That includes the things that you will need in order to create a <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>
<p>For your reference, that means that you can use it to create a video showing off a picture collage with music. Usually by making use of the templates provided by the software and uploading your own images (although, in the newest version of Filmora, Filmora V11, there is a ‘Stock Media’ option that includes an endless supply of photographs, videos, music, etc. for adding to your content.)</p>

<h2 id="02-Canva"><a href="#02-Canva" class="headerlink" title="02 Canva"></a>02 Canva</h2><p>Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a <strong>picture collage with music</strong></p>
<p>Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)</p>

<h2 id="03-Express-It"><a href="#03-Express-It" class="headerlink" title="03 Express It"></a>03 Express It</h2><p>You can say that “Express It” is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a <strong>photo collage with music</strong> <strong>app</strong> that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.</p>

<h2 id="04-Smilebox"><a href="#04-Smilebox" class="headerlink" title="04 Smilebox"></a>04 Smilebox</h2><p>Smilebox is an automatic video collage maker that is capable of turning photographs into a video collage without much input from you It’s the tool to use if all you’re looking for is a quick solution. By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety</p>
<p>It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>

It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done</p>
<p>Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free <strong>music photo collage</strong> tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.</p>

<h2 id="02-Canva-2"><a href="#02-Canva-2" class="headerlink" title="02 Canva"></a>02 Canva</h2><p>Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a <strong>picture collage with music</strong></p>
<p>Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)</p>

<h2 id="03-Express-It-2"><a href="#03-Express-It-2" class="headerlink" title="03 Express It"></a>03 Express It</h2><p>You can say that “Express It” is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a <strong>photo collage with music</strong> <strong>app</strong> that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.</p>

By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety</p>
<p>It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>

It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done</p>
<p>Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free <strong>music photo collage</strong> tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.</p>

<p>It is definitely possible Usually, people use video collage makers for this reason. But you can also create an actual photo collage with music as well (no need to use actual video clips if you don’t want to.)</p>
<p>In the end, it all depends on the collage maker you’re using to be completely honest. In this case, the collage maker in question would have to have video editing functionalities advanced enough to allow you to create a video consisting of a picture collage with music Learn more about the different tools that you can check out below as we break down some of the best of the best available</p>

That includes the things that you will need in order to create a <strong>music photo collage</strong></p>
<p>For your reference, that means that you can use it to create a video showing off a picture collage with music. Usually by making use of the templates provided by the software and uploading your own images (although, in the newest version of Filmora, Filmora V11, there is a ‘Stock Media’ option that includes an endless supply of photographs, videos, music, etc. for adding to your content.)</p>

<p>Color is abundant in our life. Our moods, sensations, and perceptions, as well as our decision-making processes, are all influenced by color. Emotion evokes by color. It affects our perception, eliciting subconscious or conscious responses in the human brain. Color is perhaps the most robust tool at your disposal as a designer because of its influential and communicative nature.</p>

<p>Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best <strong>color that matches together</strong> to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we’ve got you backed up. The ten best <strong>colors that match everything</strong> are listed below to help you create your next design.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is a color combination?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [Types of color combinations](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [Two-color combination vs. Three-color logo combinations](#Part 3)</p>
<p>04 [How to apply color combinations to your designs?](#Part 4)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Color Combination?"></a>Part 1 What is Color Combination?</h2><p>Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect <strong>colors that match everything</strong>. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Color Combinations"></a>Part 2 Types of Color Combinations</h2><p>Learning how different <strong>colors match together</strong> is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.</p>
<p><strong>The color wheel contains:?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>

<p>Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).</p>
<p>Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.</p>
<p>On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.</p>
<p>Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.</p>
<p>Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.</p>
<p>You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.</p>

<p>Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best <strong>color that matches together</strong> to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we’ve got you backed up. The ten best <strong>colors that match everything</strong> are listed below to help you create your next design.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Color Combination?"></a>Part 1 What is Color Combination?</h2><p>Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect <strong>colors that match everything</strong>. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Color Combinations"></a>Part 2 Types of Color Combinations</h2><p>Learning how different <strong>colors match together</strong> is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.</p>
<p><strong>The color wheel contains:?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>

                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).</p>
<p>Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.</p>
<p>On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.</p>
<p>Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.</p>
<p>Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.</p>
<p>You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.</p>

<p>Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best <strong>color that matches together</strong> to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we’ve got you backed up. The ten best <strong>colors that match everything</strong> are listed below to help you create your next design.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Color Combination?"></a>Part 1 What is Color Combination?</h2><p>Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect <strong>colors that match everything</strong>. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-2"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Color Combinations"></a>Part 2 Types of Color Combinations</h2><p>Learning how different <strong>colors match together</strong> is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.</p>
<p><strong>The color wheel contains:?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG"
                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).</p>
<p>Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.</p>
<p>On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.</p>
<p>Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.</p>
<p>Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.</p>
<p>You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.</p>

<p>The pink color family is your best pick if you’re looking for a design that shouts “approachable.” These colors are distinct enough to provide visual interest to the design while remaining similar sufficient to maintain an innocent appearance.

<p>Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best <strong>color that matches together</strong> to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we’ve got you backed up. The ten best <strong>colors that match everything</strong> are listed below to help you create your next design.</p>

<p>02 [Types of color combinations](#Part 2)</p>

<p>04 [How to apply color combinations to your designs?](#Part 4)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Color Combination?"></a>Part 1 What is Color Combination?</h2><p>Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect <strong>colors that match everything</strong>. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-3"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Color Combinations"></a>Part 2 Types of Color Combinations</h2><p>Learning how different <strong>colors match together</strong> is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.</p>
<p><strong>The color wheel contains:?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG"
                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).</p>
<p>Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.</p>
<p>On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.</p>
<p>Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.</p>
<p>Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.</p>
<p>You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This fantastic color combination is ideal for creating a design that shouts spontaneity and dependability. The perfect tag-team, marigold yellow, catches the eye while dark brown keeps it. Yellow is yet another favorite pick of <strong>color that matches dark brown</strong>.</p>

<p>The pink color family is your best pick if you’re looking for a design that shouts “approachable.” These colors are distinct enough to provide visual interest to the design while remaining similar sufficient to maintain an innocent appearance. When you add maroon to the mix, you reduce the chance of appearing foolish while also exuding just the appropriate amount of professionalism. Hot Pink and Maroon are my top picks for a <strong>color that matches light pink</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Sort the Imported Files</strong></p>
<p>Once you are done with importing all the media files, you can see them appear within the ‘File Queue’ at the left window of the slideshow creator program. Use the ‘Up&#x2F;Down’ arrow keys to sort the media files in your preferred order, for example, arranging them according to their specific file names. The file sorting options are available at the right side of the ‘File Queue’.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add a Desired Background Music</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Icecream Slideshow maker pro</strong> allows you to include a background music track within your presentation. For working towards the inclusion process, you will have to import the desired audio files to the program’s editor timeline. The software works well with the WAV, WMA, FLAC, M4A, MP3 and OGG audio file formats. Navigate to and hit the ‘Add Audio’ button in the editor workspace to ‘Drag and Drop’ the desired music files within the software’s timeline.</p>
<p>There is an option to create a playlist of the selected audio tracks, along with dragging the files to set them in a preferred sequence within the playlist. You are also granted the liberty to try hands at looping the audio playback and uplift the tracks with fade and offset effects within the playlist pane.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Tweak Some Extra Settings</strong></p>
<p>If you are keen towards making your presentation more impressive, try experimenting with including transition effects within the slides. Though the <strong>Icecream slideshow maker full version</strong> supports the application of default random transitions, you are allowed to add and customize the same as per your will, both, separately for each slide, as well as to the entre presentation as a whole.</p>
<p>You can even choose to add no transition effect at all, or set the same transition value for all the media files within the queue, by navigating to and clicking on the ‘Common Image Settings in the ’File Queue’ window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Create Your Icecream Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>When you have finalized all the arrangements and settings, navigate to and hit the ‘Preview’ button at the bottom right corner of the ‘Preview’ window to initiate a mock run of your slideshow in the software’s inbuilt slideshow player. If everything seems fine, proceed to start the slideshow creation process by clicking on the ‘Create’ button.</p>

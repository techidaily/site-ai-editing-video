<p>Nowadays, digital means such as Photoshop or Illustrator are used to create the screen print effect, which is achieved by using a layer mask to cut out a portion of the image and filling it with the color or pattern of your choice. The design is then printed onto fabric using water-based <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel" >CMYK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) inks with inkjet printers.</p>
<p>Suppose you’ve ever wanted to create the screen print effect in Photoshop to give that artistic look to your pictures and embed them in your clothes or other accessories but don’t know where to start or are not familiar with the process. In that case, this guide can surely help you figure this out quickly!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Picture of the object:</strong> We will cut out the object from the original image using the Lasso tool and unsaturate it. However, you have to ensure that the object is clear and easily detectable within the picture.</li>

                ></p>
<p>Now, click the <strong>“File”</strong> option in the top toolbar, and from the drop-down menu, select <strong>“Open.”</strong> Next, choose the image you want to apply the screen print effect by browsing to its location on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-object-image-in-photoshop-to-create-screen-print-effect.png"
                      alt="click the file option"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Next, click the <strong>“Lasso”</strong> tool from the left-side menu to create the selection around the object in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Press the <strong>CMD&#x2F;Ctrl + C</strong> on your computer’s keyboard to copy the selection. Next, click the “<strong>Layer</strong>“ option in the top toolbar, select “<strong>New</strong>,” and click “<strong>Layer via Copy</strong>.”</p>

                      alt="click layer via copy"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Now, hide the background layer in the <strong>“Layers”</strong> panel on the right-hand side, and you will get your object without any BG. Click the <strong>“Image”</strong> option in the top toolbar and select <strong>“Adjustments.”</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>“Threshold…”</strong> from the drop-down menu, and set the <strong>“Threshold level.”</strong> Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Cmd&#x2F;ctrl+Shift+U”</strong> on the keyboard to desaturate the image.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step4 Next, select the <strong>“Magic Eraser Tool”</strong> from the left-side menu and remove the white parts to smooth down the background. Afterward, choose the <strong>“Move Tool”</strong> from the menu and drag your object to a new layer.</p>
<p>To add the background image, click <strong>“File”</strong> and select <strong>“Open.”</strong> Next, select the file and again click <strong>“Open.”</strong></p>
<p>Step5 Select the object using the <strong>“Move Tool”</strong> and drag it to the background image layer. If the thing is too large and you want to resize it, select the object using the <strong>“CMD&#x2F;Ctrl”</strong> key and click <strong>“Edit”</strong> from the top toolbar. From the drop-down menu, choose <strong>“Transform”</strong> and click <strong>“Scale.”</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="select the object using the move tool"
                ></p>
<p>Next, drag the handles to adjust the size of the object on the Background image.</p>
<p>Step6 Click the <strong>“T”</strong> icon from the left-hand side menu and set the font style, color, and size. You can also click the <strong>“3D”</strong> option to convert your text to a three-dimensional form.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-text-to-the-canvas-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="click t icon"
                ></p>
<p>Try removing the left-out white patches on the object using the <strong>“Magic Eraser Tool”</strong> to give a polished look to the print screen effect. Once you are satisfied, click the <strong>“File”</strong> option from the top toolbar panel and select <strong>“Save As.”</strong></p>
<p>Type in the file name and select the file type from the drop-down menu next to <strong>“Save As Type.”</strong> Choose the storage location, click <strong>“Save”</strong> to export your final project, and you’re done!</p>

Once you have successfully added the effect element onto your editing workspace, you have to make it do the magic. Attaching the magic effect bling to the base (background) video is like painting your canvas for the magic to occur. It is a crucial step for bringing out those Harry Potter-like magical feats. Continue scrolling for step-by-step instructions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the effect element and open the Editing Menu.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the basic tab, as visible above, <strong>Check</strong> the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then <strong>adjust</strong> the element’s position at the wand’s tip on the preview window.</li>

You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand’s tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element’s position onto the wand’s tip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.</p>
<p>Finally, it is time to look at the results. Witness how you have curated a magical masterpiece.</p>

Dividing the entire process into a series of individual processes, the aforesaid facility caters to ease out the video creation task.</p>
<p>Moving ahead to draft a technical explanation of storyboards, they are a collection of chronologically arranged drawings, supplemented with video customization elements, such as dialogues, camera direction and other allied detailing. The fundamental merit of these visual arrangements lies in the sequential and scene unfolding of a video footage.</p>
<p>This in turn, works to simplify the film creation process, while ensuring the latter’s cohesiveness and facilitating the elimination of errors and inconsistencies. It is a common mistake to regard storyboards as a midway and optional utility, these trial and error representations are quite essential to ensure a flawless video output in the final stage of design. The facility works additionally to minimize unnecessary production delays, while significantly cutting down on the overall creation cost.</p>
<p>Having a visibility more or less similar to a comic strip, storyboards have a varying scale of design, ranging from being modestly simple to explicitly complex, in cohesion with the specific creation requirements. These visual scripts are mostly hand crafted, through there are a host of storyboard creation software packages and programs available in the IT design market, as well as across the web.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Let’s Start Storyboarding!</strong></p>
<p>Move ahead to planning the sequential placement of shots and scenes of the story in line with the script that you have just created. It is a great idea to pick an array of 4-6 movement shots for a particular scene, so that you can have a sufficient cell spacing to expand the detailing of shot elements. This further caters to a convenient and spatial arrangement of the cells on a standard sized paper.</p>
<p>You can now start to create your storyboard by adding labels to the scenes, penning down the directions, including the specific character dialogues and suitable images.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Prepare a Layout of Your Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with adding all the elements of the script into the storyboard cells, proceed to lay them out in a specific pattern. This step comes quite handy in checking for the continuity and detailing accuracy of the depicted shots. You can further, improvise the elements if needed, or advance to the next step if everything seems fine.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Revise Your Craft</strong></p>
<p>Being an experienced and professional worker, you may well proceed to start filming your video at this stage. In an otherwise case however, you may need to make a revision of the crafted storyboard for a much more detailed and comprehensive observation. You can work to include an elusive paly of effects, lighting cues, background music and characters, camera motions, and a series of additional elements that seem to uplift your creation.</p>
<p>Paying attention to the aspect or revising your storyboards caters to a much more improvised and professionally sound presentation of your video production idea in front of the target audience. If not so, you can make your roughly crafted storyboard shine on with a little bit of extra and finer detailing, and that is it! Your story is ready to strike the floors!</p>

<p><strong>How Can I Get Better at Storyboarding?</strong></p>
<p>Speaking in the light of film production assets and utilities, storyboarding is more of a creative art rather than a customary process or production stage. While it requires consistent effort and practice to master the craft, adhering to some handy tips and tricks can be of great help to improve your skills at creating expressive and finely detailed storyboards.</p>
<p>Heading towards sorting the aforesaid query, the following section presents a concise description of a few amazing and unique storyboard creation guidelines and tricks to present the storyboarding craft at its best:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Stop Aiming to Become a Perfectionist</strong></p>
<p>Considering the fact that you are crafting the storyboard just for the purpose of depicting a sequence of video shots, do not aim at defining every element in comprehensive detail. Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>
<p>Since the storyboard you are creating works as a blueprint for the video creation team, it should be convenient to understand and navigate through. Presenting the cells of your storyboard in a numbered sequence tends to provide an easy follow through of the same to the rest of your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Explore Your Imagination</strong></p>
<p>Your storyboard happens to be the inaugural representation of your video production idea and script in front of the potential audience. You should hence, proceed with the latter’s crafting process while keeping a close reference with the drafted script. Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Storyboards with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Creating storyboards in the traditional paper and pencil format is undoubtedly an absolute fun activity, but it has the limitations of a customary image drawing. If you want to supplement the contents of your storyboard with additional elements of animations, effects, background themes and music, it would be better to work with storyboard creator software.</p>
<p>Browsing through the heap of alternatives across the web and the IT market, you can conveniently choose to work with the Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to address the concern.

<h2 id="Part-3-Storyboard-Q-A-3"><a href="#Part-3-Storyboard-Q-A-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Storyboard Q&amp;A"></a>Part 3 Storyboard Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>How can the storyboard creation process be quickly addressed?</strong></p>
<p>When aiming to quickly address the concern of creating storyboards, picking up an online template is a better option in comparison to the traditional pencil and paper drawing. As of working with the web based alternatives, you can add sketches, scripts and notes within the storyboard cells to make them more impressive and detailed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What should be the ideal expanse of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule to decide the optimum number of cells or pages for your storyboard. The page count may have variations in line with the content and detailing of the scenes they are crafted to showcase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is it essential to include every shot within the storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>On a general note, every shot within your script does not require an inclusion within the storyboard. The answer to this query however, largely depends on the intensity of detailing you wish to add and the diversity of ideas and elements you want to incorporate within the storyboard of a specific film scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the essentials of a good storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>When attempting to create a good storyboard, pay attention to the fluent transition of the text centered ideas into pictorial representations. Your video script should possess the right quantity of information to make anyone easily understand the content depiction without having a prior walk-through of your script. Abstain from creating an information overflow either, lest you would end up hiding away the relevant details.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the major parts of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>A well-crafted storyboard comprises of 4 important elements. There are namely, the subject of the shot or scene, a suitable and cohesive background, a properly angled camera shot of the main character within the scene and a responsive camera movement.</p>

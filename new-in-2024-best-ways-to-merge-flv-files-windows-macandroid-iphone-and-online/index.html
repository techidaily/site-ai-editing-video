<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide to Merge FLV files on Windows&#x2F;Mac using Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch Wondershare Filmora and load FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>When you run this FLV joiner, simply click <strong>“Import”</strong> to load all of the local FLV files that you want to merge to the User’s album of this FLV video merger. You can also just drag and drop the target files from your PC into the album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/merge-flv-1.jpg"
                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Merge FLV files into one…</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of this FLV file merger, there lies a <strong>Timeline</strong>. Drag FLV files from the album to the Timeline and use the slider bar to help you arrange all FLV files in the Timeline without overlapping them. That’s very important as if you put one video to another, the original video will get split. Also, make sure that all FLV files are placed in the sequence in which they are to be played. If not, you can rearrange any video clip with a simple drag-and-drop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose the target format as FLV…</strong></p>
<p>When you are sure that all FLV files are in the correct required order on the Timeline, you can view the effect in real-time in the preview pane. If everything is fine, you are now ready to export this new FLV file. All you have to do is just press the <strong>“Create”</strong></p>
<p>button, then go to the <strong>“Format” tab &gt; “FLV” output format</strong> in the output window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export a new FLV file…</strong></p>
<p>Finally, click the <strong>“Create”</strong> button to save the settings and export the new FLV file simultaneously. When it’s done, simply navigate to the whole FLV video using the output file path.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/merge-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Remove undesirable parts…</strong></p>
<p>Once finished choosing mode and format, simply press <strong>“OK”</strong> to go back to the main screen. Then double-click these FLV files one by one to preview them. You can change the timeline to remove unnecessary sections from your FLV videos. Moreover, renaming and rearranging these video files can also be realized in this step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit FLV files (optional)…</strong></p>
<p>The software has an editor that allows you to easily and flexibly enhance your FLV video files by clicking <strong>“Edit”</strong> next to each file before joining.</p>
<p><img

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>

The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>

The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

<p>AR i.e. Augmented reality is a unique approach that is trendy for its variety of applications. It is a technology that provides the composite view to the user’s perception of real world images and videos.</p>
<p>It is a great development in the direction of technological advancement. AR is the concept that combines real-life objects with simulated 3D objects. Businesses use this approach to make their products more presentable and lively for the customers. Whereas, it is also very helpful for the users to experiment and have fun. With the evolution of this approach, now there are many applications available in the market that offers AR functionaltiy. Here, we are listing down the top 10 <strong>AR video apps</strong> which are worth using to experience something unique.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-VR-and-AR"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-VR-and-AR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?"></a>Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?</h2><p>Both AR and VR use a distinctive approach and consider different use cases. They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-a-Moving-Part-of-a-Video-Using-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-Blur-a-Moving-Part-of-a-Video-Using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur a Moving Part of a Video Using Filmora"></a>How to Blur a Moving Part of a Video Using Filmora</h2><p>You can also blur a moving part of your video with Filmora; this program allows you to add the motion-tracking mosaic to any moving object in your video that you do not want your viewers to see. You can use stickers, mosaic, or anything you download on the internet to hide any unwanted moving object.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is how to blur a moving part of a video using Filmora:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run Filmora on your device.</li>
<li>Import your video into Filmora’s Media Library.</li>
<li>Drag your video to the Timeline.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Now, double-click the video in the Timeline. Doing this will open the editing menu.</li>
<li>Check the box that’s right next to Motion Tracking; this tool allows you to track movement in a video and then have objects like text, images, videos, or elements follow this movement.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>A tracker box will appear on your preview window; move it over the moving object you would like to track. You can increase or reduce the size of the tracker box. Hit the Start Tracking button to render the effect.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to blur a moving part in video with filmora - tracker box"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Wait until the tracking process is complete. The duration of this process will depend on the length of your video. You’ll have to do some trimming if other objects block the moving part you’re tracking from time to time.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to blur a moving part in video with filmora - complete checking"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>WNow, select the Add Mosaic option.</li>
<li>Choose the Mosaic type you prefer and adjust the opacity and blur amount to ensure the object is unrecognizable.</li>
<li>Now, select the moving part of the video you want to blur and click OK.</li>
<li>The object is now blurred, and the mosaic layer will follow its movement everywhere it goes.</li>
<li>Playback your video to check the result. Filmora allows you to fine-tune the position and size of the object that’s following the track in your Preview Window without restarting tracking. Additionally, you can switch the follower anytime you want.</li>
<li>When you have finished blurring the moving part on your video, click File &gt; Save Project or Save Project As to save your video.</li>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-3"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.</p>

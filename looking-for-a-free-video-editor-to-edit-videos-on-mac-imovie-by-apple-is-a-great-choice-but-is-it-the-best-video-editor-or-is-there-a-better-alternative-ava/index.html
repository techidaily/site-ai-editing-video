Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.</p>
<p>Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.</p>
<p>Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>custom slide show</strong> creation process with the finest details:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Tool</strong></p>
<p>Start the <strong>custom slide show PowerPoint</strong> creation process with launching the PowerPoint tool in any of your preferred devices. It would be better to work on a desktop or a PC. Proceed to open the presentation that you wish to create a custom slideshow from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Custom Slide Show Option</strong></p>
<p>In the welcome interface of PowerPoint, navigate to the ribbon at the top and hit the ‘Slide Show’ tab, followed by clicking on the ‘Custom Slide Show’ button from the ‘Options Panel’ that appears. As you tap the aforesaid button, a dropdown menu follows next, from where you need to choose the ‘Custom Shows…’ option.</p>

Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.</p>

Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.</p>
<p>Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.</p>
<p>Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the <strong>custom slide show</strong> creation process with the finest details:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Tool</strong></p>
<p>Start the <strong>custom slide show PowerPoint</strong> creation process with launching the PowerPoint tool in any of your preferred devices. It would be better to work on a desktop or a PC. Proceed to open the presentation that you wish to create a custom slideshow from.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Custom Slide Show Option</strong></p>
<p>In the welcome interface of PowerPoint, navigate to the ribbon at the top and hit the ‘Slide Show’ tab, followed by clicking on the ‘Custom Slide Show’ button from the ‘Options Panel’ that appears. As you tap the aforesaid button, a dropdown menu follows next, from where you need to choose the ‘Custom Shows…’ option.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Custom Shows Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>The completion of Step 2 brings up the ‘Custom Shows’ dialog box, with a blank area at the left, indicating the absence of any custom slide show as yet. To create one, navigate to and click on the ‘New’ button at the right side within the dialog box.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Define Custom Show Dialog Box</strong></p>
<p>As you tap the ‘New’ button, the ‘Define Custom Shows’ dialog box pops up with a display of the following fields and buttons:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slide Show Name Box</strong></p>
<p>Use this field to assign a name to your custom slideshow. In case you don’t add a name of your choice, PowerPoint will assign the name ‘Custom Show 1’ to your custom presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slides in Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Below the ‘Slide Show Name’ box, appears a list of slides in the chosen presentation which you can use to create the custom slide show. To add slides to the same, click on the respective slide names.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add Button</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Add’ button in the middle of the ‘Define Custom Show’ dialog box is used to include selected slides from the main list explained above to the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list at the right. The ‘Add’ button however, remains disabled until you make a selection from the main slides list to include within the custom slides list. Take note that you can choose to repeat the slides within the custom list.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Remove Button</strong></p>
<p>You can use this button to select and delete specific slides from the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list. The button however, remains disabled till you make a slide selection to be removed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Slides in Custom Show</strong></p>
<p>This is a list of slides that you have selected from the main slides list to include in the custom slideshow.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Re-Order Buttons</strong></p>
<p>These are ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ arrows at the right side of the ‘Define Custom Show’ dialog box, which are active only if the ‘Slides in Custom Show’ list has more than one slide to its credit. In such a case, you can use these arrows to change the sequence of appearance of the slides within the custom presentation.</p>

<h3 id="Step-1-Initiating-the-Process-3"><a href="#Step-1-Initiating-the-Process-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Initiating the Process"></a>Step 1: Initiating the Process</h3><p>Begin the process by launching Wondershare Filmora. For starters, let us work on the perfect music for the video. The Audio tab shows an awful collection. Choose the “Young and Bright” category for the music.</p>
<p>![select music category](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vhs-and" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vhs-and <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> glitch-filter-15.jpg)</p>
<h3 id="Step-2-Picking-the-Music-3"><a href="#Step-2-Picking-the-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Picking the Music"></a>Step 2: Picking the Music</h3><p>Select any music and drag and drop it to the timeline. Now, trim the music into 15 seconds long. Now, input the travel videos to start their editing. Set the order for the video afterward.</p>

<h3 id="Step-3-Choosing-the-Overlays-3"><a href="#Step-3-Choosing-the-Overlays-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Choosing the Overlays"></a>Step 3: Choosing the Overlays</h3><p>Navigate to the “Effects” panel and search for VHS. The software would offer multiple choices to pick from. Choose different overlays and place them onto the video tracks as you like.</p>

<h3 id="Step-4-Adding-the-Transition-3"><a href="#Step-4-Adding-the-Transition-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Adding the Transition"></a>Step 4: Adding the Transition</h3><p>To add the transition, head to the “Transition” tab and find VHS. Drag and drop the transitions among the cuts between the video clips. Adjust their duration as needed. Preview the video, and the mission is accomplished.</p>

<h3 id="Final-Thoughts-3"><a href="#Final-Thoughts-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Thoughts"></a>Final Thoughts</h3><p>Grabbing the attention of the audience is not as easy as it sounds. The creative industry uses a vast range of effects to compel the viewers to be on the edge of their seats. The article introduced the VHS filter while covering its procedure. If you are a TikTok, Instagram, or Photoshop user, we have got you. Wondershare Filmora helps perfectly to add the glitch filter to the vacation videos.</p>

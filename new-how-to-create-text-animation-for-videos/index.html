<h3 id="a-Preparation"><a href="#a-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="a. Preparation"></a>a. Preparation</h3><p>You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.</p>
<p>Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.</p>
<p>Take the first main video and don’t forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.</p>
<p>Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>

Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>

<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>
<p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p>

When exporting directly to YouTube, the app will enable you to write titles and descriptions or set categories and tags. If you choose to upload your videos to YouTube directly, you can transfer it to your file folder first.</p>
<h2 id="Essential-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Color-Grading-in-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#Essential-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Color-Grading-in-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Essential Things You Should Know About Color Grading in LumaFusion"></a>Essential Things You Should Know About Color Grading in LumaFusion</h2><p>Color grading is an essential post-production process that gives your footage’s color scheme a distinctive appearance and character. This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.</p>
<p>With color grading, you can adjust your video’s color balance, saturation, contrast, luminance, black level, etc. It helps to evoke the particular emotions or moods that you want your videos to exude.</p>
<p>These are the essential things to note about color grading in LumaFusion:</p>
<h4 id="1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading-3"><a href="#1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?"></a>1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>
<p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p>
<p>Fortunately, LumaFusion allows you to import and apply LUT (look-up tables). With LumaFusion LUTs, you can color grade your footage to your satisfaction.</p>
<h4 id="2-How-To-Color-Grade-in-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#2-How-To-Color-Grade-in-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="2. How To Color Grade in LumaFusion"></a>2. How To Color Grade in LumaFusion</h4><p>This is how to color grade your videos:</p>
<p>○ First, Color Correct</p>
<p>When attempting to color grade your footage, it’s essential that you <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >color correct <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it first. Color correction ensures that your video doesn’t remain flat or unexciting.</p>
<p>○ Create Your LUTs</p>
<p>LUT allows you to save specific color grades to use anytime you need them. This helps to save time by ensuring that you don’t develop color spaces all over again when working on various footage. You can also download as many free LUTs as you like.</p>
<p>○ Bring In a LUT</p>
<p>After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It’s that simple!</p>
<h4 id="3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion-3"><a href="#3-Can-I-Use-Multiple-LUTs-in-LumaFusion-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?"></a>3. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?</h4><p>The short answer is a big YES. You can apply multiple LUTs in LumaFusion.</p>
<p>Here’s how t go o about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply your first LUT</li>
<li>Export the LUT</li>
<li>Access rendered movies</li>
<li>Apply the second LUT</li>
</ol>
<p>There is numerous manipulation you can do with LUT. For example, you can merge two or more LUTs into one.</p>

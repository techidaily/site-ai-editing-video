Pros and Coins about TS Video Format</h2><p>Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.</p>
<p>Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.</p>
<h3 id="Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of TS File Format"></a>Drawbacks of TS File Format</h3><p>Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.</p>
<p>Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.</p>

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS"><a href="#TS" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4"><a href="#MP4" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line"><a href="#Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format. We talked about how you can play TS files on VLC and also shed light on its pros and cons. Moreover, we also shared a video editor to edit your TS file format videos.

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-1"><a href="#TS-1" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-1"><a href="#MP4-1" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>
<h3 id="Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="Bottom Line"></a>Bottom Line</h3><p>The article has shared great details about the TS format.

MP4: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="TS-2"><a href="#TS-2" class="headerlink" title="TS"></a>TS</h3><p>TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.</p>
<h3 id="MP4-2"><a href="#MP4-2" class="headerlink" title="MP4"></a>MP4</h3><p>MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the ‘.ts’ extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.</p>

What Is TS Video Format?</h2><p>A TS format file is a Video Transport Stream file. The TS file extension is used to store video data, mostly on DVDs. The video files are standardly compressed with .MPEG video compression. If you are looking for a file extension to save streamed or broadcast videos, TS video format is ideal for this. Are you worried about how to play a TS file?</p>

<p>Well, a video file with this format can easily be played on a certain media player or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Pros and Coins about TS Video Format</h2><p>Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-3"><a href="#Advantages-of-TS-File-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of TS File Format"></a>Advantages of TS File Format</h3><p>A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.</p>
<p>Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.</p>
<h3 id="Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-3"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-TS-File-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of TS File Format"></a>Drawbacks of TS File Format</h3><p>Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.</p>
<p>Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.</p>

<p>Make sure that the phone or camera is on a steady surface to avoid any turbulence or frame shifting.</p>
<p><strong>● Sufficient Light</strong></p>
<p>Make sure there is sufficient light and ambiance. Once you have set your camera, these are the three shots you have to take:</p>
<h3 id="Shot-1-Jump-Into-the-Air-at-a-Distance"><a href="#Shot-1-Jump-Into-the-Air-at-a-Distance" class="headerlink" title="Shot 1: Jump Into the Air at a Distance"></a>Shot 1: Jump Into the Air at a Distance</h3><p>The subject will jump into the air at a distance from the camera. He should jump as high as he can, folding his legs so his body is in a ball position while in the air. The distance should be proper—not very far away.</p>

This shot has to be taken directly in front of the camera.</p>

Here is a step-by-step guide for editing these shots.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Edit-These-Clips"><a href="#Steps-To-Edit-These-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Edit These Clips"></a>Steps To Edit These Clips</h3><p>The tools we are going to use in this editing are masking, time ramping, speed ramping, keyframing, the Boris FX effect, and many more.</p>
<p><strong>Open Wondershare Filmora and Add Video Tracks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Select the empty background clip (shot 3) and place it on the first video track timeline.</p>
<p>Step2 Now place the jumping clip (shot 4) on the top.</p>
<p><strong>Adding a Freeze Frame</strong></p>
<p>A freeze frame is a type of still image that is created by simply freezing the action. Most of the time, this is used in the last shot of a movie to capture a moment in time. Here are the steps to adding a free frame.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Move the playhead up to the point where the subject’s body appears smallest.</p>
<p>Step2 Add a freeze frame at this point by right-clicking on the playhead and selecting the speed option.</p>
<p>Step3 Make a cut at the start of the freeze frame, keep it for 8 frames and delete the rest.</p>

                      alt="initial steps"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Masking of the Video Clips</strong></p>
<p>Masking is a tool in editing software that allows you to hide, duplicate, show, or adjust footage by selecting a specific section of the video or using video overlays. The steps for adding the masking effect are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Now click on the clip view to open the “settings” window.</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the “mask” section and select the circle mask and create the mask of the jumping subject.</p>
<p>Step3 Hide the first track clip so that mask can be viewed better and edited effectively.</p>
<p>Step4 Adjust the scale, position, and shape of the mask and make the edges smoother to match the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/super-jump-effect-5.gif"
                      alt="masking"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Boris Fx Effect</strong></p>
<p>Boris FX is a video editing and visual effects software. Filmora supports six continuum units-professional quality effects plugins from award-winning developer Boris FX.</p>
<p>To add these effects to your videos, follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Go to the “effects” window and open the Boris FX effects.</p>
<p>Step2 Select the directional blur from the bcc blur category.</p>
<p>Step3 Drag the effect to the freeze frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now clicking on freeze frame, its settings will open.</p>
<p>Step5 Adjust the degree and angle of blur to get a perfect mask object. Turn ON the first video track.</p>
<p>Step6 Add the landing clip (shot 2) on top of the first video track after the freezing frame.</p>
<p>Step7 Find the point where the subject starts to descend toward the floor. Cut the clip here and delete the previous part.</p>
<p>Step8 Move the clip next to the freeze frame clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/super-jump-effect-6.gif"
                      alt="borax fx effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Keyframing</strong></p>
<p>Now we have to add animation in the freezing frame so that the masked shadow can be shown moving from the back towards the front, a speedy moving shadow. This is probably the most crucial step in editing.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the freezing frame, and in the settings window, open “animation.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the customized option. Add the first keyframe at the start of the clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Now move two frames and add another keyframe with the position of the masked shadow as it is moving out of frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now move two frames keeping the settings the same.</p>
<p>Step5 Add another keyframe at the end with your masked shadow appearing half from the top of the frame.</p>
<p>This step is a bit tricky to understand, but the most important. Once it is done, your animation will give the impression of an object moving like a flash from the back to the front of view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/super-jump-effect-7.gif"
                      alt="keyframing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramping</strong></p>
<p>Once the keyframing is done, your super jump effect is roughly ready. All you have to do now is synchronize the speed of jumping, moving shadow, and landing. Here we will use the “speed ramping” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the clip, and in the settings window, choose “speed.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on customize and increase the speed of any frame or clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Move the play head on the frame that you intend to increase the speed of, and move the frame on the speed window to speed up that part.</p>
<p>Once you have done speed ramping on both clips, your editing is done. Now play the video and see how the clip looks and if your super jump effect is remarkable or not.</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Make sure you follow all these steps in the correct order. You can get Filmora from the Filmora website, but its cracked versions are also available. While editing, try to make the transitions and clips as smooth and synchronized as you can.

<p>It’s difficult to make an intro in After Effects. To start, you must have a natural beginning that will catch the</p>
<p>viewer’s attention in the film you’ve made right away. Then, you can improve the caliber of your intros by using built-in filters, transition effects, overlays, animation, and more! Therefore, we’re confident that this article will be helpful to you if you’ve been trying to learn how to create After Effects intros of the highest level. Continue reading to learn more.</p>
<p>Let’s start off!</p>
<h2 id="1-Create-a-new-composition-for-your-intro"><a href="#1-Create-a-new-composition-for-your-intro" class="headerlink" title="1. Create a new composition for your intro"></a>1. Create a new composition for your intro</h2><p>You must build up your video’s composition based on the output. You can upload the previously recorded video after choosing the composition and the runtime. Right-click again and select “Pre-compose” from the menu that appears. To make it simpler to find later, you can also rename your movie here.</p>
<p>The composition can then include a solid layer. Follow *Layer &gt; New &gt; Solid* to get to this option. Additionally,</p>
<p>you can choose a hue based on the type of video you want to make. Additionally, you may use the Text option to build text layers, which will allow you to split the words at different points in the document. You can edit each word separately when you break it into layers. Finally, you can move the text around and change the color of the reader to make it more appropriate for your films.</p>
<p>After Effects makes it incredibly simple to edit the text composition and import it into the timeline of the film.</p>
<p>A panel appears on the right after importing a text composition. Here, you can alter the text’s color, position,</p>
<p>and size.</p>
<h2 id="2-Add-the-first-transition-layer"><a href="#2-Add-the-first-transition-layer" class="headerlink" title="2. Add the first transition layer"></a>2. Add the first transition layer</h2><p>By include the transition layer, you may use After Effects’ effects templates to apply a variety of effects to your</p>
<p>videos. You can experiment with a variety of transition layers in After Effects before selecting the ideal one (CC Light Wipe is a popular choice).</p>
<p>You can modify the transition after applying it to the layer. For instance, you may decide to apply the second</p>
<p>key transition at a later period in the timeline and configure the first key transition to occur immediately at the start of the timeline. Setting the completion value is crucial since it will influence how long the word will remain displayed in the video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Add-the-second-transition-layer"><a href="#3-Add-the-second-transition-layer" class="headerlink" title="3. Add the second transition layer"></a>3. Add the second transition layer</h2><p>The transition effect you introduced in the first stage can either be maintained here, or you can select an</p>
<p>entirely different one. According to how long you want the text to be displayed, add the layer and adjust</p>
<p>completion. The reader is invisible when the completion value is set to 100%, or the word is said when it is set</p>
<p>to 0%.</p>
<p><strong>A memory sketch</strong></p>
<p>If you want to make a black-and-white video that is more interesting, the memory sketch is a great template to use. You can make a visually beautiful video with its outstanding text captions, fluid transitions, and excellent animations.</p>
<p><strong>Toolkit for Instagram</strong></p>
<p>These days, Instagram is a very popular social media site. Instagram is a platform where reels and videos</p>
<p>flourish, therefore you must make every effort to differentiate your video from the millions of others available.</p>
<p>The Instagram Toolkit template meets the standards of the social media network by being brief, clear, and</p>
<p>appealing.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting sweep</strong></p>
<p>A final transition effect, which can be found in the *Effects &gt; Generate *section, must be added to the video in order to complete the effect. The final flourish can be added in the same way as the other keyframes. In this step, you can use the edge intensity, sweep intensity, and direction. This allows you to seamlessly combine the transition of words with lighting effects.</p>
<p>These are some quick and easy techniques to adding some intros to your videos that look professional. Let’s</p>
<p>also take a look at some well-known templates you may utilize to make perfect video intros. Because the initial few seconds of any video are so important, After Effects has put together some incredible templates that have a variety of video clips, images, text, sound effects, and music tracks. To produce the video you want, you must obtain the ideal template.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Utilizing templates will hasten your workflow even though it takes some time to become familiar with After</p>
<p>Effects’ various tools. To gain a feel for how After Effects functions, we advise playing around by adding some</p>
<p>clips and titles. When you do that, you will be well on your way to creating a fantastic intro for your upcoming</p>
<p>video project.</p>

<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide to Merge FLV files on Windows&#x2F;Mac using Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch Wondershare Filmora and load FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>When you run this FLV joiner, simply click <strong>“Import”</strong> to load all of the local FLV files that you want to merge to the User’s album of this FLV video merger. You can also just drag and drop the target files from your PC into the album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Merge FLV files into one…</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of this FLV file merger, there lies a <strong>Timeline</strong>. Drag FLV files from the album to the Timeline and use the slider bar to help you arrange all FLV files in the Timeline without overlapping them. That’s very important as if you put one video to another, the original video will get split. Also, make sure that all FLV files are placed in the sequence in which they are to be played. If not, you can rearrange any video clip with a simple drag-and-drop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose the target format as FLV…</strong></p>
<p>When you are sure that all FLV files are in the correct required order on the Timeline, you can view the effect in real-time in the preview pane. If everything is fine, you are now ready to export this new FLV file. All you have to do is just press the <strong>“Create”</strong></p>
<p>button, then go to the <strong>“Format” tab &gt; “FLV” output format</strong> in the output window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export a new FLV file…</strong></p>
<p>Finally, click the <strong>“Create”</strong> button to save the settings and export the new FLV file simultaneously. When it’s done, simply navigate to the whole FLV video using the output file path.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/merge-flv-5.jpg"
                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Remove undesirable parts…</strong></p>
<p>Once finished choosing mode and format, simply press <strong>“OK”</strong> to go back to the main screen. Then double-click these FLV files one by one to preview them. You can change the timeline to remove unnecessary sections from your FLV videos. Moreover, renaming and rearranging these video files can also be realized in this step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit FLV files (optional)…</strong></p>
<p>The software has an editor that allows you to easily and flexibly enhance your FLV video files by clicking <strong>“Edit”</strong> next to each file before joining.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Merge FLV files and save…</strong></p>
<p>Finally, all you have to do is press the <strong>“Convert”</strong> button to enable Joyoshare Video Joiner to begin combining these FLV files. The merged FLV file will be saved as a converted file on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Format Factory (Free tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Format Factory is a free Windows video joiner, recorder, converter, downloader, and editor. It supports a wide range of file types, including FLV, MKV, MP4, 3GP, WMV, SWF, AVI, MPG, VOB, WebM, and others. It is not difficult to use it to combine FLV files.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Run Format Factory…</strong></p>
<p>After installing Format Factory, go to <strong>“Video Joiner &amp; Mux”</strong> to proceed.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Add Files”</strong> allows you to import FLV files in batches. When all FLV files have been loaded, click <strong>“Clip”</strong> to clip and crop FLV files as needed. Then, under <strong>“Output Settings,”</strong> choose an output format and further customize the output quality.</p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

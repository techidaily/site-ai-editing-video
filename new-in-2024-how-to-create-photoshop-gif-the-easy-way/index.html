<p><strong>File -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Load Files into Stack</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-2.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- File Stack Loading"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Image Selection</strong></p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-3.JPG"

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Make a Timeline Setup</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Window’ tab in the top menu and click the ’Timeline’ checkbox. You will see the ‘Timeline Window’ pop up below the Photoshop workspace, where you need to select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ tab. This will cause the options for frame animation to pop-up.</p>

<p><strong>File -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Load Files into Stack</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-2.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- File Stack Loading"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Image Selection</strong></p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-3.JPG"

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Make a Timeline Setup</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Window’ tab in the top menu and click the ’Timeline’ checkbox. You will see the ‘Timeline Window’ pop up below the Photoshop workspace, where you need to select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ tab. This will cause the options for frame animation to pop-up.</p>

<p><strong>File -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Load Files into Stack</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-2.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- File Stack Loading"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Image Selection</strong></p>
<p>In the next pop-up window, click ‘Browse’ and choose the image file you wish to load into the Photoshop stack. In case the selected images seem tom lack proper alignment, click on the ‘Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images’ checkbox to set this straight and make your GIF frame stable.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-3.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- File Browse Window"
                ></p>
<p>Click on ‘OK’ when you are happy with your selections.</p>
<p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-4.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- Confirm Selection Window"
                ></p>
<p>At this instant, Photoshop starts creating layers for the uploaded images, which you can see in the ‘Layers’ panel at the bottom-right. You are allowed to rearrange the image layers by selecting and dragging them or click on layer names to rename them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Photoshop- Image Layer Creation"
                ></p>
<p>If you notice distortion in Photoshop’s automatic alignment of your images, just crop the images frames to sort this out. Here’s how you can get this done:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tap the ‘Crop’ symbol.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust the crop frame to select the desired portion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click on ‘Enter’ to confirm the action.</p>
<p>If you didn’t permit auto alignment previously, no worries, you can move ahead.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Make a Timeline Setup</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Window’ tab in the top menu and click the ’Timeline’ checkbox. You will see the ‘Timeline Window’ pop up below the Photoshop workspace, where you need to select the ‘Create Frame Animation’ tab. This will cause the options for frame animation to pop-up.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Decide Time Frames</strong></p>
<p>Select your topmost image frame to see a play duration of ‘0 sec’ below its thumbnail. Click to open the drop-down menu beside it and choose suitable time duration for the frame to run. Allot time durations to all successive frames in a similar manner.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop- Top Layer Hiding"
                ></p>
<p>Continue to hide previous layers in successive frames so that each layer appears in its respective frame at the end of the process.</p>

<li>Windows Movie Maker is an ideal app for image slide shows and was developed to create photo and home movie slide shows. It presents excellent fun transitions and themes; you may add music easily. This app provides excellent variety, being a free editing application. Furthermore, it offers transitions and striking effects to function with.</li>
<li>Windows Live Movie Maker is free of cost for all Microsoft Windows users and is basically for clients having zero to minimum experience editing audio and videos. Moreover, it has many special effects you may use while creating videos. Also, you may frag and then place any picture or video anywhere you wish to see it.</li>
<li>You can choose from several themes, enhancing your film with tools like contemporary themes, fade effects, and sepia toning choices. You have to click once, and then the users can choose and apply from the multiple effects collection.</li>
</ul>
<p> Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Movie Maker contains unlimited audio and video tracks, yet it provides just one accessible one at a time. Hence, if you wish to include some other audio or music track, you may prepare the video, thereby sending it to the ultimate file.</li>
<li>It isn’t uninstallable using any remove or add control panel. Also, it is impossible to do video overlaying.</li>
<li>This app requires much patience because it is prone to crashes. Moreover, you’ll require enough time and effort to do video reversing. It often becomes frustrating for all advanced editors to cut clips into small parts and then add them back. Hence, Windows Movie maker isn’t good for professional video editors.</li>
<li>Windows Live MovieMaker can crash and freeze and is known to suffer frequent crashes. Hence, ensure saving often and avoid creating complex videos. Also, you cannot perform complex editing and can now prepare single audio and video track.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="10Neo-Tokyo-3"><a href="#10Neo-Tokyo-3" class="headerlink" title="10Neo-Tokyo"></a>10Neo-Tokyo</h3><p><strong>Major Attractions</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Compiling 3 short stories into a single movie, this one is an experiment of brilliance in the anime world</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The engaging storylines of each of the 3 shorts will never let you have enough of the movie with a desire to stream one more time</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The directors aim to tell the stories in an animated poetic style that suits the theme of the plot.</p>
<p>Introduced to the anime cinema in 1987, Neo-Tokyo was initially addressed as Manie Manie: Labyrinth Tales. The movie is a split-up craft of the biggest names in the anime world and features shots directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Katsuhiro Otomo and Rintaro.

<p>As of ‘The Running Man’ directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the latter is an ugly science fiction noir short that draws its inspiration from Blade Runner. The storyteller here is a sports correspondent who gets the privilege to see Jack Hugh’s last race. This legendary sports star of a dangerous running tournament was then reported to have imbibed fatal psionic tendencies.</p>
<p>Reserving the best for the last, here enters ‘Construction Cancellation Order’, the last short directed by Katsuhiro Omoto. The story progresses with the journey of Tsutomu Sugioka, who is sent to a fictitious and remote area in Aloana Republic, a city in South America by his seniors. His job is to shut down Facility 444, a remote construction project of his Japanese company.</p>
<p>Put collectively, Neo-Tokyo is a masterpiece of technical excellence that showcases the bright future of amine movies, provided that they are crafted by the most unique film creators of the anime world.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Comments</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a fantastic and cohesive alignment of 3 non-connected stories in one frame to represent an integration that is nothing short of magic</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a gorgeous play of twisted blocks and designs that conveniently takes the shape of a really great anthology flick</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<li>Its editor is very advanced, and the user has luxury of control over so many things.</li>
<li>A specific portion of the script can be emphasised; the volume can also be controlled alongside rate and pitch for the specific parts as well. Only few text-to-speech softwares have this feature.

<h2 id="CONS-3"><a href="#CONS-3" class="headerlink" title="CONS"></a>CONS</h2><ul>

<li>There is no preview in NoteVibes; you can’t listen to the voice preview of the script; rather, the voiceover has to be generated to listen and to know how a speaker sounds.</li>
<li>Demos are unavailable. On the homepage, demo can be found and played, but while generating voiceovers, no demo will be found.</li>
<li>It has no merge feature: You can’t combine multiple audio files to make it one. Almost all major text-to-speech tools have a merge feature, but, Notevibes lags in this respect.</li>
<li>Voiceover &amp; Editor Page is different. There is one specific page for generating the voiceover and one page for downloading audio files. Switching between both of them will consume time. If you have a big project, switching between both pages will be tiring.</li>
<li>No Project-Based Structure: This is another feature that you need when you have big project. Keep multiple files in one place can create a mess. You can’t create any project inside Notevibes. This is a very immature structure.</li>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<li>It has issues with speed, and also produces a highly concentrated robotic sound. Coming along these is its very expensive commercial options. Notevibes can also not read from PDF and docs.</li>
<li>There is no preview in NoteVibes; you can’t listen to the voice preview of the script; rather, the voiceover has to be generated to listen and to know how a speaker sounds.</li>
<li>Demos are unavailable. On the homepage, demo can be found and played, but while generating voiceovers, no demo will be found.</li>
<li>It has no merge feature: You can’t combine multiple audio files to make it one. Almost all major text-to-speech tools have a merge feature, but, Notevibes lags in this respect.</li>
<li>Voiceover &amp; Editor Page is different. There is one specific page for generating the voiceover and one page for downloading audio files. Switching between both of them will consume time. If you have a big project, switching between both pages will be tiring.</li>
<li>No Project-Based Structure: This is another feature that you need when you have big project. Keep multiple files in one place can create a mess. You can’t create any project inside Notevibes. This is a very immature structure.</li>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<li>Its editor is very advanced, and the user has luxury of control over so many things.</li>
<li>A specific portion of the script can be emphasised; the volume can also be controlled alongside rate and pitch for the specific parts as well. Only few text-to-speech softwares have this feature. This one feature therefore makes it stand out from others. Its voice quality is no different from others.</li>
<li>Notevibes also lets you make dialogue videos where you can use more than one voice to create a voiceover. Your narration then sounds more creative and captivating when this feature well utilised. There are total 201 voices available in NoteVibes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="CONS-23"><a href="#CONS-23" class="headerlink" title="CONS"></a>CONS</h2><ul>
<li>It has issues with speed, and also produces a highly concentrated robotic sound. Coming along these is its very expensive commercial options. Notevibes can also not read from PDF and docs.</li>
<li>There is no preview in NoteVibes; you can’t listen to the voice preview of the script; rather, the voiceover has to be generated to listen and to know how a speaker sounds.</li>
<li>Demos are unavailable. On the homepage, demo can be found and played, but while generating voiceovers, no demo will be found.</li>
<li>It has no merge feature: You can’t combine multiple audio files to make it one. Almost all major text-to-speech tools have a merge feature, but, Notevibes lags in this respect.</li>
<li>Voiceover &amp; Editor Page is different. There is one specific page for generating the voiceover and one page for downloading audio files. Switching between both of them will consume time. If you have a big project, switching between both pages will be tiring.</li>
<li>No Project-Based Structure: This is another feature that you need when you have big project. Keep multiple files in one place can create a mess. You can’t create any project inside Notevibes. This is a very immature structure.</li>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<li>Its editor is very advanced, and the user has luxury of control over so many things.</li>
<li>A specific portion of the script can be emphasised; the volume can also be controlled alongside rate and pitch for the specific parts as well. Only few text-to-speech softwares have this feature. This one feature therefore makes it stand out from others. Its voice quality is no different from others.</li>
<li>Notevibes also lets you make dialogue videos where you can use more than one voice to create a voiceover. Your narration then sounds more creative and captivating when this feature well utilised. There are total 201 voices available in NoteVibes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="CONS-33"><a href="#CONS-33" class="headerlink" title="CONS"></a>CONS</h2><ul>
<li>It has issues with speed, and also produces a highly concentrated robotic sound. Coming along these is its very expensive commercial options. Notevibes can also not read from PDF and docs.</li>
<li>There is no preview in NoteVibes; you can’t listen to the voice preview of the script; rather, the voiceover has to be generated to listen and to know how a speaker sounds.</li>
<li>Demos are unavailable. On the homepage, demo can be found and played, but while generating voiceovers, no demo will be found.</li>
<li>It has no merge feature: You can’t combine multiple audio files to make it one. Almost all major text-to-speech tools have a merge feature, but, Notevibes lags in this respect.</li>
<li>Voiceover &amp; Editor Page is different. There is one specific page for generating the voiceover and one page for downloading audio files. Switching between both of them will consume time. If you have a big project, switching between both pages will be tiring.</li>
<li>No Project-Based Structure: This is another feature that you need when you have big project. Keep multiple files in one place can create a mess. You can’t create any project inside Notevibes. This is a very immature structure.</li>

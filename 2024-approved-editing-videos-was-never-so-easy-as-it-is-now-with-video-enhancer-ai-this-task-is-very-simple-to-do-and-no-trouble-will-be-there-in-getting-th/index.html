To do so, just describe your imagination in simple words. Then, you are asked to pick one resolution from given options. You can use the generated images in your projects directly. It allows you to generate an image from your chosen style. A few of the styles include Freestyle, Cyberpunk, and Futuristic.</p>

<h4 id="Method-1-Using-Chroma-Key-1"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Chroma-Key-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using Chroma Key"></a>Method 1: Using Chroma Key</h4><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your project in Filmora and import two files in the timeline. Bring the background clip first in the timeline, then the original file. Cut the unnecessary portion of background-clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replacing-sky-background-with-photoshop-9.jpg"
                      alt="importing media files"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Keep them selected and come to the “AI Tools” option in the right-side panel. Enable the “Chroma Key” toggle, and AI will automatically replace the background. You can use the “Tolerance,” “Edge Thickness,” and “Edge Feather” sliders for manual changes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replacing-sky-background-with-photoshop-10.jpg"
                      alt="use chroma key to remove background"
                ></p>
<h4 id="Method-2-Through-AI-Portrait-1"><a href="#Method-2-Through-AI-Portrait-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Through AI Portrait"></a>Method 2: Through AI Portrait</h4><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import your background clip and main video in Filmora 13. Place the background clip on track 1 and the main clip on the 2nd track in the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replacing-sky-background-with-photoshop-11.jpg"
                      alt="adding files to filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold both of them and head to the right-side panel. Press the “AI Tools” option and scroll to access the “AI Portrait.” Enable that option, and your background will automatically change with AI. Now, you can make manual changes by moving the “Edge Thickness” and “Feather” sliders.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replacing-sky-background-with-photoshop-12.jpg"

<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To wrap up, let’s say that <strong>Sky Photoshop</strong> sets the right tone for your media with landscapes. On the other hand, this feature might prove difficult for some users to handle. Thus, they can rely on Wondershare Filmora for convenience. Beginners and professionals can benefit from its extraordinary features in video editing.</p>

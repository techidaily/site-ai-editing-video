<h2 id="So-what-is-LUT"><a href="#So-what-is-LUT" class="headerlink" title="So, what is LUT?"></a>So, what is LUT?</h2><p>LUT refers to Look Up Tables, which a custom color templates you use when creating videos. These help you create content for different devices, including television and mobile devices. For example, you can create custom LUTs for easy conversion from standard definition to more modern cinematic formats such as 4K and UHD.</p>
<h3 id="What-are-the-different-types-of-LUTs"><a href="#What-are-the-different-types-of-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="What are the different types of LUTs?"></a>What are the different types of LUTs?</h3><p>Here are the colour lut categories for filmmakers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transform</li>
<li>Calibration</li>
<li>Viewing</li>
<li>1D: 1D lut offers customization on one value of your colors. These are available as .lut file types.</li>
<li>3D: These award you more control over your luts video editing since they offer saturation, hues, and brightness levels on different axis. You will find these as .cube file types.</li>
</ul>

<p>These allow you to make your content vibrant and mimic the color schemes of famous filmmakers such as David Fincher. He is famous for using greens and blues in his films to arrest your attention. He does this by employing a darker than usual color scheme, which leaves you staring at the screen for the entire film. You can see this color lut in the movie Fight Club or The Social Network.</p>

<h2 id="Why-do-we-need-to-use-LUTs"><a href="#Why-do-we-need-to-use-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="Why do we need to use LUTs?"></a>Why do we need to use LUTs?</h2><p>You use LUTs for different reasons, as you can see from David Fincher’s example. However, here are a few more:</p>
<h4 id="•-To-add-emphasis-to-a-particular-scene"><a href="#•-To-add-emphasis-to-a-particular-scene" class="headerlink" title="• To add emphasis to a particular scene"></a>• To add emphasis to a particular scene</h4><p>Sometimes, it can be challenging to communicate the importance of your message using standard color schemes. As such, filmmakers use dramatic color schemes in their content. For example, the colour scheme in the above photo emphasizes the tranquillity of the sea between contrasting landscapes.</p>

Similarly, you can use a transformation colour lut to add a cinematic effect to your film to make it appear as if your audience is viewing it in a theatre.</p>
<p>Camera manufacturers use different color luts to diversify their products according to their target markets. For example, you get a different lut color grading from a Sony camera as you would in a Canon.</p>

<p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two <strong>Face Tracking</strong> features, i.e., Outline Only and Detailed Feature. The former will help only to track the face, while the latter provides detailed data on different facial features to help you change the eye color, mouth movements, etc.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore <strong>Face Tracking,</strong> its applications, how it works, and its challenges and drawbacks. We will also provide an easy-to-follow guide on using the Face Tracking feature in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Face-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Face-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Face Tracking"></a>Part 1. What Is Face Tracking</h2><p>Face Tracking is a process of identifying or detecting the areas of the face, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, in a video or image. This effect can be used to track and animate face replacements, retouch footage, or add effects to a user’s face in live footage.</p>
<p>Where It Is Applied</p>
<p>Face Tracking can be used for a variety of applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing One Face With Another:</strong> This is helpful if you need to change the face of a character in video footage.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Automatic Effects:</strong> With this feature, you can apply effects to a face in live footage.</li>
<li><strong>Retouching Footage</strong>: Face Tracking can help you retouch a face in a video clip, for instance, you can smooth it or change the skin tone, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Robotic Devices:</strong> Certain robots use Face Tracking technology to perform human tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Face-Tracking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Face-Tracking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Face Tracking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Face Tracking Work?</h2><p>Face Tracking algorithms usually begin by detecting facial landmarks, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Once detected, the AI algorithms use them to track the face as it moves. This information can be used to perform various tasks, such as identifying the person’s emotions or estimating their head pose.</p>
<p>Face Tracking technology is constantly improving and is now being used in various new applications, such as to create 3D models of people’s faces, control robotic devices, and create more realistic avatars for virtual reality systems.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-The-Challenges-And-Drawbacks-Of-Face-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-The-Challenges-And-Drawbacks-Of-Face-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking"></a>Part 3. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking</h2><p>Face Tracking is a technology that has been growing in popularity in recent years. This technology allows computers to detect and track human faces in real-time. While Face Tracking has many potential applications, some challenges and drawbacks also need to be considered:</p>
<p>One of the main challenges with Face Tracking is that it can be difficult to track faces in different lighting conditions. Faces can also be obstructed by objects such as hats or glasses. Another challenge is that things like photographs, makeup, or masks can fool face tracking.</p>
<p>Some privacy concerns need to be considered when using Face Tracking. This technology can be used to collect sensitive data about people without their consent.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges and drawbacks, Face Tracking remains a promising technology with many potential applications, and it can help with many tasks such as identifying a perpetrator, finding a missing person, better security measures in banks and airports, and many more.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-The-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-The-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. The Face Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 4. The Face Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool that can be used for various purposes, including Face Tracking. This feature enables you to track the movement of a person’s face and detect specific parts of a face, including eyes, nose, mouth, etc., to let you work with these facial features individually.</p>
<p>For instance, you can change the mouth movement or pupil color without frame-by-frame adjustments. Moreover, you can measure facial features to see the details, such as how open the eye or mouth is.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Here’s a simple and quick rundown of the features of Face Tracking in Adobe After Effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help you detect faces and provide isolated data points to help you refine the content.</li>
<li>Retouch the face in a video without adjusting it frame by frame.</li>
<li>Let you export the tracking data to Character Animator for creating performance-based animations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Function</p>
<p>There are two Face Tracking functions in the Tracker panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face Tracking (Outline Only):</strong> This feature will only help you to outline the face in a video clip.</li>
<li><strong>Face Tracking (Detailed Features):</strong> This option will help you if you want to detect the different facial features and parts, including the eye, pupil, eyebrow, mouth, and nose. You can also take exact measurements of the features.</li>
</ul>

The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 5. The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>Follow the guidelines below to use Face Tracking in After Effects:</p>
<p>Face Tracking To Outline A Face</p>
<p>Step1Launch the <strong>After Effects</strong> software and click <strong>“File”</strong> in the top <strong>Toolbar.</strong> Select <strong>Import</strong> and click <strong>“File.”</strong> Find the video footage and add it to the <strong>Project panel.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding the footage to the project panel"
                ></p>
<p>Step2To add a new layer, drag and drop the video footage from the <strong>Project Panel</strong> to the <strong>Composition.</strong></p>
<p>Step3Drag the blue <strong>current-time indicator</strong> in the <strong>Timeline</strong> to a frame showing the face’s upright and front view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="dragging the blue cti to a frame with the face in the upright and front position"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Now, you have to draw a <strong>closed mask loosely</strong> around the face. This helps identify the region for locating the facial features. The top mask is used for <strong>Face Tracking</strong> if you have selected multiple masks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="creating a closed mask loosely around the face"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Click the <strong>“Window”</strong> option from the top <strong>Toolbar</strong> and scroll down to <strong>“Tracker.”</strong> Select <strong>“Face Tracking (Outline Only)” as</strong> the tracking method in the <strong>Tracker Panel.</strong></p>
<p>Step6To make sure the tracking is working correctly, track forward or backward one frame at a time and click the <strong>“Start”</strong> button to start the analysis process of the frames. Once finished, you can find the <strong>Face Tracking data</strong> within the Composition.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

In the launch screen, navigate to and tap any one of the ‘Add Photo’ or ‘Add Folder’ buttons at the top left corner to import either a single media file, or an entire media folder to the program’s editing workspace.</p>

<p>As soon as you finish the media import process, the editing workspace bifurcates to present the ‘Queue’ window at the left and ‘Preview and Settings’ window at the right side of the screen. This is the space where you can proceed to configure your presentation settings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>File Sorting</strong></p>
<p>To sort the arrangement of a media file, navigate to the ‘File Queue Panel’ at the left and click on the desired file, while using the ‘Arrow Keys’ at the right to change the latter’s position in the queue, or choose to delete it from the queue by tapping the ‘Recycle Bin’ icon beside the file.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Post a successful installation, proceed to launch the program and wait for the latter’s welcome screen to appear. In the launch screen, navigate to and tap any one of the ‘Add Photo’ or ‘Add Folder’ buttons at the top left corner to import either a single media file, or an entire media folder to the program’s editing workspace.</p>

You can alternatively, click on the ‘Add Files to Start Your Photostory’ tab in the center of the software’s welcome screen to import the required media files.</p>

Your choices are however; filtered according to their respective file formats and only those in line with the formats supported by the Icecream Slideshow creator program are imported to the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Configure the Presentation Settings</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you finish the media import process, the editing workspace bifurcates to present the ‘Queue’ window at the left and ‘Preview and Settings’ window at the right side of the screen. This is the space where you can proceed to configure your presentation settings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>File Sorting</strong></p>
<p>To sort the arrangement of a media file, navigate to the ‘File Queue Panel’ at the left and click on the desired file, while using the ‘Arrow Keys’ at the right to change the latter’s position in the queue, or choose to delete it from the queue by tapping the ‘Recycle Bin’ icon beside the file.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Duration and Transition Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Proceeding further, you can try hands at customizing the duration and transition effects for each of the added media files within the queue. All you need to do is, navigate to and click on the respective tabs within the window. Hit the ‘Time’ button to adjust the screen time of the slides or click on the ‘Transitions’ tab to include suitable animation effects between successive slides for a smooth presentation flow.</p>
<p>You can even stick with a random transition effect to add to the slides, or choose to add no transition effect at all.

The ‘Transition’ and ‘Time’ settings are the sole customizations that you can apply individually to the slides, the rest of the effects being universally applicable to all the presentation slides together.</p>
<p>If you are interested to apply a particular transition and play duration to all the slides, navigate to and click within the gray bar at the bottom of the file queue to apply the same transition and time characteristics to all the slides of the presentation.

<p>You are additionally, permitted to configure the added music track in line with your specific preferences using the ‘Fade’ and ‘Offset’ settings at the right side of the selected music file. To play the audio track immediately with a time shift, choose to set a negative offset value. Likewise, enter a positive offset value to start playing the track after the lapse of a specified time period.</p>

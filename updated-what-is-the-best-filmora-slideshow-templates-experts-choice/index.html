When designing an anime character, there are a series of aspects to be held into the light. Considering the fact that these elements add spark and engagement into the story being depicted, enough focus should be laid on crafting out the minute details that are essential to infuse liveliness and suitability into the character.</p>
<p>Anime characters are created to foretell a customary tale in a fantasizing manner, depicting all the superficial elements that you may possibly never imagine of coming across in real life. Another aspect is the animation element that happens to be the pivot of anime designing. All these put together on a single palette work to bring out an amazing anime story to life. But that’s not all.</p>
<p>No doubt on the significance of the aforesaid elements in crafting the most perfect anime design, but an essential fact that naturally goes unnoticed is the creator’s own interpretations and thoughts about the specific anime characters that are responsible for delivering a captivating story. Talking of specific character design, the key is to include the exact and accurate details of style, physical features, body language, costumes and other nuances that are crucial factors to comment on how the audience relates and responds to the character.</p>
<p>Respecting the diversity in the realm of <strong>anime design</strong>, each character tends to portray a completely distinguished appeal from the others. As of the likehood factor, while some characters receive a moderate attention, there are others who conveniently succeed in creating a long lasting impact. Moving ahead with our discussion along the same line, let us talk about some of the most loved and stand out anime character designs in what follows next:</p>
<h3 id="01My-Hero-Academia"><a href="#01My-Hero-Academia" class="headerlink" title="01My Hero Academia"></a>01My Hero Academia</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Character design has a significant influence of Western comics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Special attention is paid on the hair styling and costume selection of each character</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The characters have a unique color crafting for a stand out recognition</p>
<p>Starting off with the list, My Hero Academia is an anime that draws its inspiration from the Western comics and the same is reflected in the latter’s character design. Moving along the line, this anime artwork dedicates itself to follow the exact footprints of the Western caricature art form in every aspect of character improvisation, right from color crafting to dynamic styling.</p>
<p>Another significant element of character design that is laid special focus on by the aforesaid anime flick, of course in cohesion with the Western comics is the hairstyle and costumes of the characters. Such elements are used to raise up the personality of the characters, while simultaneously sparking up their powers.</p>

<h3 id="02Miss-Kobayashi’s-Dragon-Maid"><a href="#02Miss-Kobayashi’s-Dragon-Maid" class="headerlink" title="02Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid"></a>02Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The series is a classic school level anime series with a reflective character design</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character formations have a minute and distinguished detailing in physical features and body language</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The costumes, shade summaries and specific personality etiquettes work to set up a subtle communication among the characters</p>
<p>Centered greatly on school level anime creation, the most reflective aspects of Kyoto Animation character designs are present in the quick apparel changes and impressive body language. For instance, a simple flip of the hair can say a lot about a character’s personality of being lazy or active. It is however, interesting to note that Kyoto Animation did not have a significant recognition in character design before the advent of Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid.</p>
<p>The aforesaid anime series opened massive doors for the animation company to try hands at experimenting with the epic cuteness that the latter is known for in today’s times. Be it the character costumes, color patterns, or even a quick shine in the eye, everything works so perfectly to build up a subtle communication among the dragon girls of this series.</p>
<p>The minute detailing works to highlight the differences between the respective personalities of these characters, along with setting each one miles apart from the other in a hoard of aspects.</p>

<h3 id="03Kill-La-Kill"><a href="#03Kill-La-Kill" class="headerlink" title="03Kill La Kill"></a>03Kill La Kill</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>animation character design</strong> of this anime series is inspired by the art style of Studio Trigger</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The best thing about the aforesaid character formations is the flawless homogeneity among the apparel design, color coding and line work</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character frames are also quite impressive and neatly adopted to the formations</p>
<p>The character design schematics of Kill La Kill attempts to display the best version of Studio Trigger’s art style. As of the specific design form, the latter works to strike the closest communication between the line work, color and costume design. A significant amount of character information can be drawn out with just a close observation of these details.</p>
<p>For instance, you can figure out the silly nature of Mayo, or the jittery one of Ryuko by sparing a mere look at their specific character outlines. Moving ahead, you can make out a clear difference among each of the Student Council Members. The expressive play of vibrant shades in the characters’ costumes makes them appear no less than those of a fight sequence.</p>
<p>No doubt on the animation expertise of Studio Trigger; yet the latter has worked a lot on their character frames as well. The anime flick has a neat adoption of these elusive character design aspects to put forward a masterpiece of art.</p>

<h3 id="04Naruto"><a href="#04Naruto" class="headerlink" title="04Naruto"></a>04Naruto</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Naruto anime series has succeeded in showcasing the Shonen Jump character design in possibly the best possible manner</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design aims to bind together the characters’ personalities with their abilities and the contemporary culture</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design is a balanced play of character communication and formation diversities</p>
<p>One of the 3 major anime productions that have incorporated the Shonen Jump’s style of character design, Naruto is credited with the depicting the best play of art through its set of the closest resembling characters. Talking of the impersonation of the other two flicks, One Piece showcases a vibrant but quite a caricaturized character formation.</p>
<p>Bleach on the other hand, excels on the artwork parameter, but relies much on customarily jumping character designs. Being far ahead of these two, Naruto succeeds to strike a balance between the expanded diversity of character formations, along with establishing an intimate communication between culture, abilities and specific character personalities.</p>
<p>A few classic examples of the expressive character sketches from the series include Konoha’s green vest, the robe-themed costume of the Village Hidden in the Sand, and the mufflers of the Village Hidden by Sound. The main leads have some distinctive and classic costume designs of their own. Having the most distinguished and catchy appeal, such elusive character designs are not going to be forgotten anytime soon.</p>

<h3 id="05Monogatari"><a href="#05Monogatari" class="headerlink" title="05Monogatari"></a>05Monogatari</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design takes its inspiration from the Studio Shaft anime character formations</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language and dressing of each character are in line with the flow of the story, giving the characters their explicit communication space</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The unique dressing style of each character is distinguished enough to clearly differentiate among personalities with a similar profile</p>
<p>Though another member in the list of high school anime series; Monogatari is no way similar to the customary, school centered anime creations. The credit undeniably goes to the exquisite character design of Studio Shaft that solely resolved to craft a unique piece of artwork for the series. An additional factor working in favor of the series is the effective communication between the latter’s student characters.</p>
<p>Regardless of the fact that the series features high school pupils as the main characters, they are gifted with a wide canvas to express their specific characterizations. Be it the body language, or the distinguished costume style, each character has its own space to communicate with the story.</p>
<p>Whether it is the extravagant dress of Kiss Shot, Karen’s egg braid and track suit in yellow, or the explicitly visible difference between Hanekawa and Senjougahara’s eye looks, everyone has its own signature style or appearance. It is impossible to have confusion between 2 characters of the series, or a 3rd one on a parallel space.</p>

<h3 id="06Hunter-X-Hunter"><a href="#06Hunter-X-Hunter" class="headerlink" title="06Hunter X Hunter"></a>06Hunter X Hunter</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The aforesaid series showcases affordably the weirdest character designs ever, but that’s what the captivating factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character styling and costume design is centered on an animal theme</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language of the non-animal characters is no less in adding to the uniqueness of character formations</p>
<p>Looking from the character design aspect, the aforesaid anime series may appear more as an odd synchronization of styling elements to most of us. However, this very weirdness is the catchy cue of the special character formations of the Hunter X Hunter storyline. Consisting of the most influential members of the Hunter Association, the character assimilation is entirely centered on the animal theme picked by the chairman.</p>
<p>The characters are made to wear some the most oddly pronounced looks, like that of Cheadle, who appears to be a dog. The striking attraction of the character design is however, the non-animal costumes of some characters, who talk better with their attitudes. A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.</p>
<p>The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.</p>

<h3 id="07Akame-Ga-Kill"><a href="#07Akame-Ga-Kill" class="headerlink" title="07Akame Ga Kill"></a>07Akame Ga Kill</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design of this anime series is based on a personality centered color coding</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The physical features and accessories used by the characters are most specific and highly pronounced</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character.

Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>

It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details.

It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing.

<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process.

You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details.

<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement.

<p><img

                ></p>
<p>It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other.

<p><img  
                     lazyload

        Shades"
                ></p>
<p>It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The aforesaid series showcases affordably the weirdest character designs ever, but that’s what the captivating factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character styling and costume design is centered on an animal theme</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language of the non-animal characters is no less in adding to the uniqueness of character formations</p>
<p>Looking from the character design aspect, the aforesaid anime series may appear more as an odd synchronization of styling elements to most of us. However, this very weirdness is the catchy cue of the special character formations of the Hunter X Hunter storyline. Consisting of the most influential members of the Hunter Association, the character assimilation is entirely centered on the animal theme picked by the chairman.</p>

A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.</p>
<p>The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The physical features and accessories used by the characters are most specific and highly pronounced</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design is engaging enough to captivate the audience to a not so impressive storyline</p>
<p>When the talk is about classic and memorable anime series, the aforesaid story would apparently fail to secure a spot in the list.

The engaging character design and elegant artwork of the series however, has managed to carve out a space in the viewers’ mind even in the current times.</p>
<p>All the members of Night Raid are given an extremely distinguished appearance; to such an extent that each one seems to have a personality centered shade code.

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design.

It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details.

It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

<p>Centered greatly on school level anime creation, the most reflective aspects of Kyoto Animation character designs are present in the quick apparel changes and impressive body language. For instance, a simple flip of the hair can say a lot about a character’s personality of being lazy or active.

Moving ahead, you can make out a clear difference among each of the Student Council Members. The expressive play of vibrant shades in the characters’ costumes makes them appear no less than those of a fight sequence.</p>

<p>One of the 3 major anime productions that have incorporated the Shonen Jump’s style of character design, Naruto is credited with the depicting the best play of art through its set of the closest resembling characters. Talking of the impersonation of the other two flicks, One Piece showcases a vibrant but quite a caricaturized character formation.</p>

Being far ahead of these two, Naruto succeeds to strike a balance between the expanded diversity of character formations, along with establishing an intimate communication between culture, abilities and specific character personalities.</p>
<p>A few classic examples of the expressive character sketches from the series include Konoha’s green vest, the robe-themed costume of the Village Hidden in the Sand, and the mufflers of the Village Hidden by Sound.

<p><strong>●</strong> The unique dressing style of each character is distinguished enough to clearly differentiate among personalities with a similar profile</p>
<p>Though another member in the list of high school anime series; Monogatari is no way similar to the customary, school centered anime creations. The credit undeniably goes to the exquisite character design of Studio Shaft that solely resolved to craft a unique piece of artwork for the series. An additional factor working in favor of the series is the effective communication between the latter’s student characters.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The character styling and costume design is centered on an animal theme</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language of the non-animal characters is no less in adding to the uniqueness of character formations</p>

A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.</p>
<p>The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement. You can however, add a tint of complementary shades when creating a character design for a cover page. When proceeding to open the color palette for your character design, there are a variety of aspects worth paying attention.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Selecting the Perfect Color Scheme"
                ></p>
<p>It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other. When picking complementary colors; look for the shades that lie across of each other on the color wheel. Such color arrangements are the preferences of almost any popular anime character you normally come across.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

        Shades"
                ></p>
<p>It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?</h2><p>Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.</p>

<p>Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it’s an easy way to make 3D motion videos.</p>
<p>To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Filming-Tips-for-Written-Texts"><a href="#Part-2-Filming-Tips-for-Written-Texts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Filming Tips for Written Texts"></a>Part 2. Filming Tips for Written Texts</h2><p>To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-1-A-Pen-and-a-White-Paper"><a href="#Tip-1-A-Pen-and-a-White-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. A Pen and a White Paper"></a>Tip 1. A Pen and a White Paper</h3><p>We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.</p>
<p>We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="purple color pen on white paper"
                ></p>
<p>It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it’s more apparent during filming.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-2-Different-Color-Paper"><a href="#Tip-2-Different-Color-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Different Color Paper"></a>Tip 2. Different Color Paper</h3><p>There are many chances that you don’t have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don’t need to worry because you can use different color papers too.</p>
<p>But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don’t use dull color pens with bright color paper.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-3-Camera-Angles"><a href="#Tip-3-Camera-Angles" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Camera Angles"></a>Tip 3. Camera Angles</h3><p>While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the writer’s hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.</p>
<p><img

<p>After checking the alignment of the camera, it’s time to look at what size we have to use for writing!</p>
<h3 id="Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters"><a href="#Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters"></a>Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters</h3><p>As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.</p>
<p>It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.</p>

<h3 id="Tip-3-Camera-Angles-1"><a href="#Tip-3-Camera-Angles-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Camera Angles"></a>Tip 3. Camera Angles</h3><p>While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the writer’s hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After checking the alignment of the camera, it’s time to look at what size we have to use for writing!</p>
<h3 id="Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters"></a>Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters</h3><p>As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.</p>
<p>It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.</p>

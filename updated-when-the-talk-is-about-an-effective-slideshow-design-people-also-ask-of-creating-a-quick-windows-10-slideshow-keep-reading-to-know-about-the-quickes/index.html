Next, place the camera on a tripod, and tilt down to show the table from the top.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step2 After that, put the arm on the tableand keep it still while filming. Meanwhile, have another hand perform on the other side of the frame and pretend to use magic to remove the tattoo.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step3 Next, you need a picture of a tattoo. Indeed, it would be better to have the tattoo in the same position on the arm so it can match the video clip we just filmed.</p>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming"><a href="#Trimming" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting"><a href="#Cutting" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

<li>You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.</li>
<li>Hold the ‘Ctrl’ key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You’ll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.</li>
<li>You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.</li>
<li>Choose the ‘Laser Tool’ located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.</li>

<h2 id="What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Cutting-and-Trimming-a-Video-3"><a href="#What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Cutting-and-Trimming-a-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?"></a>What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?</h2><p>If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming-3"><a href="#Trimming-3" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting-3"><a href="#Cutting-3" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

<h3 id="Method-1-Trim-Clips-on-Timeline-3"><a href="#Method-1-Trim-Clips-on-Timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline"></a>Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline</h3><p>If you are wondering: What is a timeline? It’s the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.</p>
<p>Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don’t alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.</p>
<p>To learn how to trim video in Premiere Pro on the timeline, follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Double click on the video file you want to trim in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Adjust the timings of your edits. Drag the ends of your video clip as if you are resizing a window to shorten or extend by trimming. As your cursor gets closer at the edge of the video clip, you’ll see a red arrow.</li>

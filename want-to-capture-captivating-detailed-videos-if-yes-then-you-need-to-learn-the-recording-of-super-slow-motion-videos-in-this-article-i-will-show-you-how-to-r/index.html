If Yes, Then You Need to Learn the Recording of Super Slow Motion Videos. In This Article, I Will Show You How to Record a Super Slow-Motion Video on Your Android and iPhone</h2><p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong> has long been among the finest (and most exploited) video effects. The method was initially limited to high-end lenses, but super slo-mo has become increasingly superior as smartphone technology advances.</p>
<p>Super slo-mo is a terrific technique to learn how to use if you want to accentuate a dramatic moment or extend the humiliation of a friend you captured in an embarrassing scenario. This article has stepwise guides and tips for recording super slo-mo on your phone. Let’s get going!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Slow-Mo-and-Super-Slow-Mo"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Slow-Mo-and-Super-Slow-Mo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?</h2><p>Super Slow-Mo (960fps) is a technology that allows users to shoot films at 960fps using a top-speed lens, capturing events that the naked eye cannot ordinarily notice by viewing them 32 times slower than regular videos (30fps) and four times slower than videos produced using the current Slow Motion feature (240fps).</p>
<p>Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9&#x2F;S9+ and Note9. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.</p>
<p>You’ll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:</p>
<p><strong>Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p> Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.</p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p>Videos are played 32 times slower than usual, catching minute changes in facial gestures and fast-moving elements.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Super-Slo-Mo-Videos-with-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-and-Later-models"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Super-Slo-Mo-Videos-with-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-and-Later-models" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?"></a>Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?</h2><p><strong>Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:</strong> Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20+, Galaxy S20+ Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip, and later models.</p>
<p>Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it’s replayed at 30 frames per second, it’s 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.</p>
<p>To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the <strong>Camera</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the <strong>Super Slow-Mo</strong> option to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the <strong>White Circle</strong> in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that your phone’s video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Samsung-Galaxy-S21"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Samsung-Galaxy-S21" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?</h2><p>Only capturing the super slow-motion videos is not enough, especially if you are a content creator. Even in the super slow-mo, there might be some unnecessary parts (since it is more detailed) that you need to cut out or the parts that need some enhancements to make the video look captivating.</p>
<p>However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the right corner. Click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the <strong>Editor</strong> option from the dropdown menu that appears.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After that, you can adjust the length, crop the video, add effects, add stickers, add music, etc., by selecting from the bottom menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you’re done editing, click on the <strong>Save</strong> option at the top to save the video to your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>

<p>Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we’ll explain this popular capture mode.</p>
<p>To begin, you should be aware that a camera&#x2F;camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.</p>
<p>The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 &#x2F; second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.</p>
<p>Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your phone’s <strong>Camera</strong> go to <strong>More</strong> to select the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the <strong>Super Slo-Mo</strong> feature, select the <strong>32X or 128X</strong> in this mode.</p>

But don’t worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:</p>
<p><strong>Utilize A Tripod</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.</p>
<p><em>You can check these</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>tripods for iPhone</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes</strong></p>
<p>To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.</p>
<p>When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you’ll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Readjust the Focus</strong></p>
<p>The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box’s area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you’re happy with the size.</p>
<p><strong>Capture in Natural Light</strong></p>
<p>Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.</p>
<p><strong>View the Video at Normal Speed</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone’s incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.</p>

<p>Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9&#x2F;S9+ and Note9. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.</p>
<p>You’ll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:</p>
<p><strong>Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p> Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.</p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong></p>

<p>Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it’s replayed at 30 frames per second, it’s 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.</p>
<p>To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the <strong>Camera</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the <strong>Super Slow-Mo</strong> option to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the <strong>White Circle</strong> in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that your phone’s video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.</p>

<p>However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the right corner. Click on them.</p>

<p>Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we’ll explain this popular capture mode.</p>
<p>To begin, you should be aware that a camera&#x2F;camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.</p>
<p>The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 &#x2F; second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.</p>
<p>Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your phone’s <strong>Camera</strong> go to <strong>More</strong> to select the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the <strong>Super Slo-Mo</strong> feature, select the <strong>32X or 128X</strong> in this mode.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the <strong>Circle</strong> in the center to start and stop the recording. The video will be saved in your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>

But don’t worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:</p>
<p><strong>Utilize A Tripod</strong></p>
<p>It’s critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.</p>
<p><em>You can check these</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>tripods for iPhone</em></a></p>
<p><strong>Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes</strong></p>
<p>To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.</p>
<p>When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you’ll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Readjust the Focus</strong></p>
<p>The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box’s area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you’re happy with the size.</p>
<p><strong>Capture in Natural Light</strong></p>
<p>Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.</p>
<p><strong>View the Video at Normal Speed</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone’s incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong> videos are excellent for showcasing the action and conveying tales, and they are also entertaining and straightforward to create.

<h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Slow-Mo-and-Super-Slow-Mo-3"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Difference-Between-Slow-Mo-and-Super-Slow-Mo-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?</h2><p>Super Slow-Mo (960fps) is a technology that allows users to shoot films at 960fps using a top-speed lens, capturing events that the naked eye cannot ordinarily notice by viewing them 32 times slower than regular videos (30fps) and four times slower than videos produced using the current Slow Motion feature (240fps).</p>
<p>Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9&#x2F;S9+ and Note9. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.</p>
<p>You’ll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:</p>
<p><strong>Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p> Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.</p>
<p><strong>Super Slow Motion</strong></p>
<p>Videos are played 32 times slower than usual, catching minute changes in facial gestures and fast-moving elements.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Super-Slo-Mo-Videos-with-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-and-Later-models-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Super-Slo-Mo-Videos-with-Samsung-Galaxy-S20-and-Later-models-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?"></a>Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?</h2><p><strong>Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:</strong> Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20+, Galaxy S20+ Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip, and later models.</p>
<p>Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it’s replayed at 30 frames per second, it’s 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.</p>
<p>To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the <strong>Camera</strong> app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the <strong>Super Slow-Mo</strong> option to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Press the <strong>White Circle</strong> in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure that your phone’s video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Samsung-Galaxy-S21-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Super-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Samsung-Galaxy-S21-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?</h2><p>Only capturing the super slow-motion videos is not enough, especially if you are a content creator. Even in the super slow-mo, there might be some unnecessary parts (since it is more detailed) that you need to cut out or the parts that need some enhancements to make the video look captivating.</p>
<p>However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Camera</strong> app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see <strong>three vertical dots</strong> in the right corner. Click on them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the <strong>Editor</strong> option from the dropdown menu that appears.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After that, you can adjust the length, crop the video, add effects, add stickers, add music, etc., by selecting from the bottom menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After you’re done editing, click on the <strong>Save</strong> option at the top to save the video to your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>

<p>Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we’ll explain this popular capture mode.</p>
<p>To begin, you should be aware that a camera&#x2F;camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.</p>
<p>The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 &#x2F; second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.</p>
<p>Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your phone’s <strong>Camera</strong> go to <strong>More</strong> to select the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the <strong>Super Slo-Mo</strong> feature, select the <strong>32X or 128X</strong> in this mode.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the <strong>Circle</strong> in the center to start and stop the recording. The video will be saved in your <strong>Gallery</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Shoot-Slo-Mo-Videos-on-iPhone-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Shoot-Slo-Mo-Videos-on-iPhone-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?"></a>Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?</h2><p>Slow-motion film on your iPhone essentially means slowing the fps so that everything appears to move slower inside the video. It is a popular effect employed by artists to produce one-of-a-kind video clips of sports footage, natural scenes, or sequences with a lot of dramatic motion.</p>
<p>Slow-motion films are supported by all iPhones, beginning with the 5S model, and the capability gets more robust and more stable with each successive generation. Shooting slow-motion films with your iPhone are addicting and enjoyable, and it adds drama to various settings.</p>
<p>Here is a step-by-step method for filming slow-mo with an iPhone, regardless of model.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone and go to the <strong>Slow-Mo</strong> effect by sliding from the options above. Change the frame rate on the upper right corner to 120, 240, 720, depending on the iPhone models you’re using.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, start the recording by clicking the <strong>Red Circle</strong> in the center or either of the <strong>Volume</strong> button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> After you’re done recording, press the <strong>Red Circle</strong> again and head towards the <strong>Gallery</strong> to view the recorded video.</p>

How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.</p>
<p>Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.</p>
<p>You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Whip-Your-Camera"><a href="#Whip-Your-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Whip Your Camera"></a>Whip Your Camera</h2><p>You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera’s movement.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a stepwise guide for you to try</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.</li>
<li>Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.</li>
<li>For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.</li>
<li>Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.</li>
<li>Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.</p>
<p>The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="Fill-The-Frame"><a href="#Fill-The-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Fill The Frame"></a>Fill The Frame</h2><p>In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.</p>
<p>Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan the two shots you are going to take.</li>
<li>Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.</li>
<li>In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.</li>
<li>The second shot will take place at another time or place.</li>
<li>To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.</li>
<li>Import both shots into <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>
<li>Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.</li>

                ></p>
<h2 id="Match-Cut"><a href="#Match-Cut" class="headerlink" title="Match Cut"></a>Match Cut</h2><p>In a video, a match cut transitions from one shot to another. During this, the composition of the two shots is matched by action, subject, and subject matter. The goal is to make a visual match between two situations that don’t have a direct link. Here are the steps to creating a match-cut transition in your videos.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plan the shot you are going to take.</li>
<li>Record the action in the first shot, for example, clapping your hands.</li>
<li>Go to another place or scene to record the second shot.</li>
<li>Repeat the same action in the second shot.</li>
<li>Import both camera shots to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li>

They tend to use different effects to light up their crafts. For them, editing videos with effects applications gives more life to the story. In this composition, you will learn more about Effects, and if you are just about to do your video editing right now, these details are definitely for you.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-Video-Effects"><a href="#What-are-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Effects?"></a>What are Video Effects?</h2><p>According to the dictionary, an effect is brought about by a cause or an agency.</p>
<p>In video editing, there are a few video effects you must know to apply them to your video project. Video effects can alter the speed and produce distortions, reflections, aesthetic filters, stylistic color grading, animation transitions, and more. They can also contain 3D features like CGI. When used well, these effects improve the narrative, the atmosphere, and the images’ overall impact.</p>
<p>Let’s dissect a few of the major effects, which will be most helpful to you.</p>
<p><strong>Pans and Tilts</strong></p>
<p>Your first thought upon hearing these two words may be tripod motions. Pans and tilts are a quick way to add additional movement and sensation to your video, making it more dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Change the Speed&#x2F;Duration</strong></p>
<p>One feature that virtually every NLE or Non-Linear Editing software gives us is the option to modify the playback speed of your video while reducing or increasing the actual duration and tempo of your segments. Slowing down your footage to match the frame rate at which the video was initially captured is one of the critical explanations for doing this.</p>
<p>To incorporate some frantic or chaotic moments into your production, you can use this to generate slow-motion shots and fast-forward effects. This effect can also quickly pan through footage for humorous effect. Find the “Speed&#x2F;Duration” option under Effects controls to accomplish this.</p>
<p><strong>Light Leaks and Flares</strong></p>
<p>Nothing gives your video a more ethereal vibe than gentle, warm light emerging from the scene. A direct source visible in the photo may be the source of this light, or it may enter the frame from the edge. You’ve probably seen these flares and leaks countless times in movies, whether they were added in post-production or resulted from the cinematographer’s lens choice. You can select where the light comes from if it doesn’t distract from the task. Remember that these spills and flares must contribute to the narrative while remaining barely perceptible to the viewer.</p>
<p><strong>Retro&#x2F;VHS Effects</strong></p>
<p>While light leaks and lens flares give your movie or film a timeless feel, nothing gives it a dated or, one would say, “scrappy” vibe. The grunge appearance of the ‘90s is in right now, and one of the most popular effects is the VHS look.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get this effect. Applying a preset, essentially a LUT (look-up table or filter), to your color grade will make the image appear fuzzier, desaturated, and blurrier (using the different alpha and gamma channels). This will cause “chroma errors,” which result from poor recordings and a lack of a flying erase head (a function that enables you to record over previously filmed video; imagine formatting your SD card while the video is still present on the card and you are simply recording over it), giving your images an outline of distorted blues and reds.</p>
<p><strong>Color Grading and Color Correction</strong></p>
<p>Besides actual editing, color grading and correction are arguably the most significant post-production steps. With the help of these tools, you may alter skin tones, highlight, and shadow levels, add vignettes, experiment with contrast, and much more. We’ll briefly go through one aspect of color grading—the ability to adjust particular colors in your image—even though this subject needs its ebook.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Overlays</strong></p>
<p>Although we’ve talked about adding overlays, such as VHS effects or light leaks, you may use many other editing overlays to add particular components to your shot, including weather particles!</p>
<p><strong>Using Titles and Motion Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Motion graphics and clean titles are essential for any video that wishes to appear professional. These could be subtitles, and the animation logo reveals post-credits, lower thirds, or even major titles. There are various free typefaces available that you may use to make your project stand out, regardless of the program you’re working in.</p>
<p>Once you’ve selected the appropriate font, color, and weight, it’s time to move on to motion graphics. These are crucial because they may transform a clear, ageless title or text into a lively, entertaining illustration of the product or concept your movie is attempting to market.</p>
<p>The abundance of tutorials nowadays makes learning the fundamentals of motion graphics a piece of cake. As I previously stated, you can access all the various effects and movements you might need, regardless of the editing program, you use.</p>
<p>These various methods and approaches need the practice to perfect, just like any other component of filmmaking. As you add these video editing effects to your editing toolkit, there will undoubtedly be a lot of trial and error. Still, eventually, they will become second nature to your workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of Applying Effects to your Video</strong></p>
<p>Almost from the first motion film, cinematic storytelling and video effects have gone hand in hand. They can improve a scene, create something that doesn’t exist, hide an error, and do much more. In essence, they assist a filmmaker in telling a tale in the manner they desire.</p>

<h2 id="Applying-Filter-effects"><a href="#Applying-Filter-effects" class="headerlink" title="Applying Filter effects"></a>Applying Filter effects</h2><p>A video filter is software that modifies a multimedia stream somehow. A filter graph is a series of filters that each accept input from an upstream filter, process the information, and then output the edited video to their downstream counterparts.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Filter</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click filter movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Filter effects depending on your preferred category.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="apply filter movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 You can see the preview of a Filter effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 If you finally chose a Filter effect, drag it onto the imported video.</p>
<p>Step5 And now you will see the changes. The “star” symbol on the imported video means you have already applied a Filter effect on it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="Adding-Transition-Effect"><a href="#Adding-Transition-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Adding Transition Effect"></a>Adding Transition Effect</h2><p>Transitions guide your audience.</p>
<p>From the opening to the very end, they structure the movie. There are numerous typical forms, including the wipe, dissolve, split-cut, and many others. Film editors use transitions to transfer a scene from one video clip to another practice. Transitions don’t need to be visible.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Transition</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click transition movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Transition effect depending on your preferred category.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select transition movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 You can see the preview of a Transition effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/preview-filter-effect-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg"
                      alt="preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 If you finally chose a Transition effect, drag it between each imported video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-to-add-transition-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="choose to add transition movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Now you will see this kind of symbol, which means you have already put a Transition effect between the imported videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Transition effects can also be applied even if you have only one video. You can put transitions effects either at the start of the video, which could make your video introduction more appealing. Also, you can set the Transition effect at the end of the video, which could give you a pleasant closing.</p>
<p><em>Transition Effect at the start</em></p>
<p><em>Transition Effect at the end</em></p>
<p><em>Also, you can make your Transition effect longer or shorter simply by clicking this symbol then it will turn yellow. Point your cursor either on the left side of the symbol; the cursor will become a horizontal double-arrow to change the span of your Transition effect on the left video or on the right end side of the symbol to change the span of the Transition effect on the right video.</em></p>
<h2 id="Applying-Titling-Motion-Effect"><a href="#Applying-Titling-Motion-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Applying Titling Motion Effect"></a>Applying Titling Motion Effect</h2><p>Most video editing applications come with built-in titling choices, and many of them vary from basic letters to a collection of motion graphics that have already been pre-programmed. Enter your text into a template to insert them.</p>
<p>The majority of video projects have crucial titles. You can use them to build a mood, label key elements of the film, and convey information.</p>
<p>Step1 Click the <strong>Title</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-title-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg"
                      alt="select title movavi slideshow maker"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Titling motion effect depending on your preferred category. You can also see the preview of a title effect by clicking it before applying it to your selected video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-title-motion-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="select title motion movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To apply the Title Motion effect, drag the effect onto the title track, just above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-title-motion-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="drag title motion track movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 You can place your Title Motion effect on your desired time where you want it to appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-title-position-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="customize title position movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 To edit your Title texts, you can double-click the applied title on the title track or right-click on it and click the “edit” option. You can also edit the text by double-clicking the title portion on the current video editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-title-text-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="edit title text movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 In this step, you can edit the Title text in the “clip editing” section, as seen in the red color box. You can change the color, text style, and font size on the yellow color box. And in the green color box, you can change the alignment of the text; you can Bold it, Italizing, and make it an Underlined text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-color-text-title-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="add color text title movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 You can also adjust the time duration of the Titling Motion effect in two ways. First, by clicking the Title effect from the title track and placing your cursor on either side (the cursor will become a double-headed arrow), you have to shorten or lengthen the Title effect. The second step is to click the “Clip” section and adjust the duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-title-duration-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="change title duration movavi slideshow"
                ></p>

                ></p>
<p>Step2 Choose your desired Titling motion effect depending on your preferred category. You can also see the preview of a title effect by clicking it before applying it to your selected video to be edited.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select title motion movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 To apply the Title Motion effect, drag the effect onto the title track, just above the video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-title-motion-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="drag title motion track movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 You can place your Title Motion effect on your desired time where you want it to appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-title-position-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="customize title position movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 To edit your Title texts, you can double-click the applied title on the title track or right-click on it and click the “edit” option. You can also edit the text by double-clicking the title portion on the current video editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-title-text-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="edit title text movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 In this step, you can edit the Title text in the “clip editing” section, as seen in the red color box. You can change the color, text style, and font size on the yellow color box. And in the green color box, you can change the alignment of the text; you can Bold it, Italizing, and make it an Underlined text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-color-text-title-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="add color text title movavi slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 You can also adjust the time duration of the Titling Motion effect in two ways. First, by clicking the Title effect from the title track and placing your cursor on either side (the cursor will become a double-headed arrow), you have to shorten or lengthen the Title effect. The second step is to click the “Clip” section and adjust the duration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/change-title-duration-movavi-slideshow.jpg"
                      alt="change title duration movavi slideshow"

Sometimes, even though the video has informative content, the content might not be attractive to the viewers for various reasons, like the content might be routine and does not have more reach, likes, or shares. Along with good content, we also need new and creative ideas to get more viewers. Thus, we have some tools to provide unique and innovative ideas based on the niche you choose.</p>
<p>Videos Idea Generator is a tool that gives ideas for YouTube videos, and it works based on AI technology (Neural Networks). This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get more <strong>AI video ideas</strong>. Naturally, you might be out of ideas for your channel, or sometimes it takes more time to get an idea, or it could be a routine idea that does not sound interesting to the viewers. In such cases, <strong>an AI video idea generator</strong> is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Time-saving – as one can utilize the time in other work, such as editing the video&#x2F; adding subtitles, etc., instead of thinking of an idea.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Engaging with the audience – can utilize the time in engaging with the audience by answering their questions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Promote videos – can utilize time to promote their videos on other social media platforms or collaborate with other content creators for promotions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add animations – animations and other visual effects can be added to the videos using AI. Also, we can add video and audio summaries after each video so that the viewers can get brief detailing of the whole video.</p>
<p><strong>How to use Videos Idea Generator:</strong></p>
<p>There are different <strong>AI video idea generator</strong> tools, and most of them work similarly. The most common steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Provide Topic</strong></p>
<p>Here you need to provide the topic’s name on which we are planning to create the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>
<p>Based on the topic name and keywords, the tool will generate suggestions for the video ideas using the Neural Network concept of Artificial Learning.</p>

After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs. The interface also could change your mind depending if you want simplicity or a challenge. Price is also a factor that can affect your willingness to use these applications.

<p>What are your thoughts on both of these tools? Did you find this information to be helpful?</p>

<p>Click the <strong>Square</strong> icon, it is located beside the <strong>Pencil</strong> icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the <strong>Proportiona</strong>l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.</p>

<p>Before jumping straight to how we can use Discord for Desktop, we must first know how to install it on our Windows and Mac PC. Here is how to install Voicemod:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, visit the Voicemod website to start the download process.</li>
<li>Next, you will see the “Get Voicemod Free” screen. Click it!</li>

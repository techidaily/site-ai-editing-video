<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>
<p>FAQs about GoPro Video Editing:</p>

</ol>
<p>Yes, GoPro has its own video editor “Quik”. It is available on mobile phones and desktops both. It is simple and easy to use. It provides basic features to edit your video.

Although this isn’t the issue with Quik mobile app, here you can import videos from other devices also.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Can I make videos for social media with a GoPro?</strong></li>

Just think of it as cutting something on your video so you can see what’s in the bottom layer. So, without wasting time, let me show you how to mask a video in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/place-the-camera-facing-the-door.gif"
                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-backwards.gif"
                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-1.jpg"
                      alt="fire up wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="proceed to hide the first track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-3.jpg"
                      alt="click the effect button"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-4.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-5.jpg"
                      alt="unhide the first track"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="film the subject walking from one side of the tree"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import the clip on filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tell your subject to walk to the marker"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>

                      alt="customize the clip with a mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>

<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That was easy, right? Playing around with Filmora’s masking tools can create incredible masking illusions like the ones we’ve discussed. And don’t forget this video editor has many more creative possibilities. You should try these masking tricks!</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="click the effect button"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="double-click the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="film the subject walking from one side of the tree"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="import the clip on filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tell your subject to walk to the marker"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tell your subject to walk to the marker"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import the clip into filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="customize the clip with a mask"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That was easy, right? Playing around with Filmora’s masking tools can create incredible masking illusions like the ones we’ve discussed. And don’t forget this video editor has many more creative possibilities. You should try these masking tricks!</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fire up wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="proceed to hide the first track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="click the effect button"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

                      alt="double-click the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>

Popular text effects in Filmora</h2><p>There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="1-Text-Swipe-Effect"><a href="#1-Text-Swipe-Effect" class="headerlink" title="1. Text Swipe Effect"></a>1. Text Swipe Effect</h3><p>Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.</p>
<p>If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Type-Text-Effect"><a href="#2-Type-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Type Text Effect"></a>2. Type Text Effect</h3><p>The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.</p>
<p>The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.</p>

Keyframe</h3><p>If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.</p>
<p>If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.</p>

You can do this by opening the <strong>“Media”</strong> tab, selecting a template, and dropping it in the timeline once it is downloaded.</p>
<p>Then, go to the <strong>“Titles”</strong> tab, choose a text style you like, and drop it in the timeline. Finally, align both the template and your video file.</p>
<p>To add text to your intro, click on the <strong>text track</strong> in the timeline. Enter the intro text, ideally the quiz topic, then customize the text color and style as desired. The Advanced option also lets you animate your text. Save the changes by clicking <strong>“OK.”</strong></p>

You can also add effects or countdown elements between questions or reveal the answer.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Repeat-The-Process-And-Export-Your-Final-Video-1"><a href="#Step5-Repeat-The-Process-And-Export-Your-Final-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Repeat The Process And Export Your Final Video"></a>Step5 Repeat The Process And Export Your Final Video</h5><p>After completing the previous steps, you can now create the entire quiz video by repeating the above steps.</p>
<p>Once you are done, click the <strong>“Play”</strong> icon to preview your work, and select the <strong>“Export”</strong> icon to either save the clip to your device or upload it directly to your YouTube channel.</p>

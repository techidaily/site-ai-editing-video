Get Smooth and Crisp Motion in Your GIFs in Just a Few Simple Steps</h2><p>GIFs have become a popular way to share short and engaging videos online. They are widely used on social media platforms and messaging apps, making it easy to share moments, reactions, and emotions with friends and family. But not all GIFs are created equal. Some GIFs can look choppy and low-quality, detracting from the viewing experience.</p>
<p>To improve the quality of your GIFs, you can convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS (frames per second). This will give your GIFs a smooth, fluid motion that looks professional and visually appealing. In this article, we’ll go over the steps you need to follow to convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS GIFs and create high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.</p>

<h2 id="Why-Convert-MP4-to-60-FPS-GIF"><a href="#Why-Convert-MP4-to-60-FPS-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?"></a>Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?</h2><p>GIFs are a great way to share short, eye-catching videos online, but not all are made the same. GIFs with low frame rates tend to look choppy, and the motion could be smoother, making the video look unprofessional and detracting from the overall viewing experience. On the other hand, GIFs with higher frame rates look smoother, and the motion is more fluid, making the video more visually appealing.</p>
<p>Converting your MP4 videos to GIFs has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smoother Motion:</strong> By converting MP4s to GIFs, you increase the frame rate of your GIFs, giving them a smoother and more fluid motion.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Detail:</strong> Higher frame rates allow for more detail and clarity in fast-moving scenes, making the video more engaging and easier to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Ghosting:</strong> A higher frame rate reduces the “ghosting” effect in low-frame rate GIFs, making the video clearer and reducing distractions.</li>
<li><strong>High-Quality Videos:</strong> Converting MP4s to GIFs eliminates the ghosting effect and creates high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Engagement:</strong> High-quality GIFs will engage and entertain your audience, making them more likely to share and interact with your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Converting MP4s to GIFs is a great way to improve the overall quality of your GIFs and create visually appealing videos that are perfect for sharing online. Whether you’re sharing a reaction, a moment, or an emotion, a high-quality GIF will engage and entertain your audience.</p>
<h3 id="Can-I-Get-a-60-FPS-GIF"><a href="#Can-I-Get-a-60-FPS-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Can I Get a 60 FPS GIF?"></a>Can I Get a 60 FPS GIF?</h3><p>While it’s true that many people search for 60 FPS GIFs, it’s important to understand that there is no such thing as a true 60 FPS GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>GIFs are an image format designed to display simple animations. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF" >GIF files store delay time between frames <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is defined as multiples of 1&#x2F;100th of a second. Value 1 would give you 100 FPS; value 2 would already have half of 100 FPS, that is, 50 FPS; value 3 would give you 33.3 FPS GIF, etc. So there are 20 FPS GIFs, 33.3 FPS GIFs, 50 FPS GIFs, and 100 FPS GIFs.</p>
<p>In addition, many websites or programs (including Google Chrome) ignore value 1 (100 FPS GIFs) and default to a much slower animation speed when viewing GIF files. Therefore, 100 FPS GIFs are technically possible but are rarely used. Value 2 (50 FPS) is the most you can get.</p>
<p>If you want to create high-quality animations, consider using MP4s or alternative image formats better suited for high frame rates and detailed animations.</p>
<p>That being said, some websites may have a “60 FPS GIFs” category, but it’s important to understand that most of the content in these categories is not 60 FPS. Instead, it’s likely to be either an MP4 video or a GIF with a lower frame rate, like 50 FPS, labeled as “60 FPS” for marketing purposes.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-Any-60-FPS-GIF-Maker"><a href="#Is-There-Any-60-FPS-GIF-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?"></a>Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 60 FPS GIF maker. As mentioned before, there is no 60 FPS GIF, so it is impossible to create a 60 FPS GIF using traditional methods. However, many excellent video-to-GIF converters in the market allow you to set the GIF frame rate.</p>
<p>These video-to-GIF converters allow you to convert MP4 videos to GIFs with a higher frame rate, which can give your GIFs a smoother and more fluid motion. While these GIFs may not be 60 FPS, they can still provide a significant quality improvement compared to traditional GIFs.</p>

<h2 id="People-Also-Ask"><a href="#People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:</p>
<h4 id="Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS"><a href="#Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?"></a>Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?</h4><p>It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n&#x2F;100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1&#x2F;100 second (100 FPS), 2&#x2F;100 second (50 FPS), 3&#x2F;100 second (33.33 FPS), 4&#x2F;100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333…&#x2F;100 second (30 FPS).</p>
<h4 id="Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF"><a href="#Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?"></a>Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?</h4><p>To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.</p>
<h4 id="Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be"><a href="#Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?"></a>Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?</h4><p>GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it’s possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.</p>
<h4 id="Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF"><a href="#Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?"></a>Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?</h4><p>The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.</p>
<p>There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.</p>

<h2 id="People-Also-Ask-1"><a href="#People-Also-Ask-1" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:</p>
<h4 id="Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS-1"><a href="#Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS-1" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?"></a>Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?</h4><p>It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n&#x2F;100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1&#x2F;100 second (100 FPS), 2&#x2F;100 second (50 FPS), 3&#x2F;100 second (33.33 FPS), 4&#x2F;100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333…&#x2F;100 second (30 FPS).</p>
<h4 id="Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF-1"><a href="#Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?"></a>Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?</h4><p>To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.</p>
<h4 id="Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be-1"><a href="#Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be-1" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?"></a>Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?</h4><p>GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it’s possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.</p>
<h4 id="Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF-1"><a href="#Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?"></a>Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?</h4><p>The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.</p>
<p>There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.</p>

<p>The best option to adopt in any such circumstances is Photoshop. With Photoshop, you can create a stunning and mind-blowing Photoshop VHS effect. If you want to learn about its steps, then continue reading.</p>
<p>Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the ‘Image’ menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the ‘Adjustments’ option and select ‘Desaturate.’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="tap on desaturate option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Now duplicate the image by dragging it onto the New Layer icon in the Layers Panel. Then double click on the duplicated image. This will open a ‘Layer Style’ settings menu. Here, click on the icon for ‘R Channel’ and deselect it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="disable channel r"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Now, it’s time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left&#x2F;right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add first glitch element"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.</p>

                      alt="use mark and move tool"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: At this point, make a New Layer and fill it with White. Now right-click on this white layer and select the option of ‘Convert to Smart Object.’</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Now, in the ‘Layers Panel,’ select the option of ‘Overlay’ from the dropdown menu so that the different layers can show through. You can adjust the visibility of the lines by adjusting the number on the scale.</p>

                      alt="change the binding mode"
                ></p>

Edit it as you did to your image so that you can make a cool glitch text effect Photoshop and with this, you are all done with making the most stunning glitch effect Photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-You-Do-Photo-Glitch-Effect-in-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-You-Do-Photo-Glitch-Effect-in-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?"></a>Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?</h2><p>The jagged lines, the colorful pixels, frozen visuals, and also the distorted colors, everything perfectly blends to make a glitch effect. Usually, this is how all the glitch templates are, but if you get an opportunity to customize your image glitch effect and make your special effect, what will you do?</p>
<p>The best option to adopt in any such circumstances is Photoshop. With Photoshop, you can create a stunning and mind-blowing Photoshop VHS effect. If you want to learn about its steps, then continue reading.</p>
<p>Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the ‘Image’ menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the ‘Adjustments’ option and select ‘Desaturate.’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tap on desaturate option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Now duplicate the image by dragging it onto the New Layer icon in the Layers Panel. Then double click on the duplicated image. This will open a ‘Layer Style’ settings menu. Here, click on the icon for ‘R Channel’ and deselect it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="disable channel r"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Now, it’s time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left&#x2F;right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add first glitch element"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.</p>

                      alt="use mark and move tool"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: At this point, make a New Layer and fill it with White. Now right-click on this white layer and select the option of ‘Convert to Smart Object.’</p>

                      alt="tap on the option of convert to smart object"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Move to the menu bar at the top and go to the ‘Filter’ section. From there, select the option of ‘Filter Gallery.’ A new window will show up. Head to the ‘Sketch’ category, and there change the ‘Pattern Type’ to ‘Line.’ You can also play with the ‘Contrast’ and the ‘Size’ of the lines.</p>

                      alt="change the pattern"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Now, in the ‘Layers Panel,’ select the option of ‘Overlay’ from the dropdown menu so that the different layers can show through. You can adjust the visibility of the lines by adjusting the number on the scale.</p>

                      alt="tap on overlay"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: After setting everything for the glitch effect in your image, you can now add colors using the ‘Gradient Map.’ Or you can also import some graphic textures to Photoshop and add them to the image. Don’t forget to change the ‘Binding Mode’ to ‘Overlay.’ You can then play with the color and graphic settings.</p>

                      alt="change the binding mode"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9: Once all the color adjustments have satisfied you, it’s time to add some text to your glitch image. For that, head to the ‘Text’ tool from the left menu and type in your text. Edit it as you did to your image so that you can make a cool glitch text effect Photoshop and with this, you are all done with making the most stunning glitch effect Photoshop.</p>

<h3 id="01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content"><a href="#01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content" class="headerlink" title="01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content"></a>01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content</h3><p>One of the main applications of <strong>AI on YouTube</strong> is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>

There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature-2"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature-2" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>
<h3 id="05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-2"><a href="#05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-2" class="headerlink" title="05Training on Depth Prediction"></a>05Training on Depth Prediction</h3><p>YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers used the “mannequin challenge” to understand depth predictions.</p>
<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>
<h3 id="06Tackle-Fake-News-2"><a href="#06Tackle-Fake-News-2" class="headerlink" title="06Tackle Fake News"></a>06Tackle Fake News</h3><p>Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.</p>

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>

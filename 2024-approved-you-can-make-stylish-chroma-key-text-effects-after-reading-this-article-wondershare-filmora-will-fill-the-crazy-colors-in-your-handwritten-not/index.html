Wondershare Filmora Will Fill the Crazy Colors in Your Handwritten Note or Words</h2><p>Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Chroma-Key-Text-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Chroma-Key-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?"></a>Part 1. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?</h2><p>Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png"
                      alt="chroma key text effect"
                ></p>
<p>Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it’s an easy way to make 3D motion videos.</p>
<p>To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Filming-Tips-for-Written-Texts"><a href="#Part-2-Filming-Tips-for-Written-Texts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Filming Tips for Written Texts"></a>Part 2. Filming Tips for Written Texts</h2><p>To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-1-A-Pen-and-a-White-Paper"><a href="#Tip-1-A-Pen-and-a-White-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. A Pen and a White Paper"></a>Tip 1. A Pen and a White Paper</h3><p>We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.</p>
<p>We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png"
                      alt="purple color pen on white paper"
                ></p>
<p>It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it’s more apparent during filming.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-2-Different-Color-Paper"><a href="#Tip-2-Different-Color-Paper" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Different Color Paper"></a>Tip 2. Different Color Paper</h3><p>There are many chances that you don’t have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don’t need to worry because you can use different color papers too.</p>
<p>But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png"
                      alt="different color paper with different markers"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don’t use dull color pens with bright color paper.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-3-Camera-Angles"><a href="#Tip-3-Camera-Angles" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Camera Angles"></a>Tip 3. Camera Angles</h3><p>While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the writer’s hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.</p>

<p>After checking the alignment of the camera, it’s time to look at what size we have to use for writing!</p>
<h3 id="Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters"><a href="#Tip-4-Larger-Size-of-Letters" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters"></a>Tip 4. Larger Size of Letters</h3><p>As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.</p>
<p>It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.</p>

However, the Nitro version is a paid subscription of $4.99 monthly. Creating a discord emoji GIF is quite simple if you are under the later version. After all, it includes the available GIF options that you can choose from depending on your taste. However, if you are under the free option, you won’t have this option.</p>

<h2 id="Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video"></a>Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg"
                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                      alt="obs customize the recording source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

<p>If you have found yourself in this circumstance, your initial instinct could be to worry and assume you must repair the issue, delete the uploaded video, and re-upload the new one. However, this procedure will make your prior video URL dead, and any embeds of your video will display the following graphic to visitors. Nevertheless, these aforementioned sites recognizes that artists occasionally make small honest errors, or someone included in the uploaded video may demand that they be removed from it. So, to permit that, makers may chop away sections from their film without resetting a video’s metrics.</p>
<p><strong>How to edit recorded video on iPhone?</strong></p>
<p>If you have iOS 13 or later, you can edit films in the built-in Photos app… much as you edit your images. You may cut, crop, and straighten your films. And you may make your film more attractive by altering brightness, color, or even making it black and white. Filming films on iPhone has gotten more popular as iPhone camera lenses have progressed over the years. Many iPhone filmmakers desire the capacity to edit their video directly from their phone for simple social sharing. Using a video editing software for iPhone is a terrific method to effortlessly produce and upload videos. just open the video you want to modify, then press Edit at the upper right to get it done.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2><p>If you routinely use Google Meet or Zoom, it can be a good idea to record your conferences so you can still return to them at a later period. Recording these conversations and meetings may be a big assistance when it’s time for later evaluations, updates, and enabling absent team members catch up on the meeting topic. For instance, do you wish to share meeting minutes or information with people missing in this meeting? Essentially the call recording is for other co-workers to view afterwards. Instead, you may use the recommended screen recorders to capture every moment and then use a specialist video editor like Filmora to make the required edits before sharing it with others.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?"></a>Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?</h2><p>Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.</p>
<p>Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.</p>
<p>Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it’s a challenge, it’s not impossible to accomplish.</p>
<p>And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:</p>
<h3 id="1-SOT-MOT"><a href="#1-SOT-MOT" class="headerlink" title="1. SOT &amp; MOT"></a>1. SOT &amp; MOT</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Single Object Tracking (SOT):</strong> SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and&#x2F;or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):</strong> MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection"><a href="#2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection" class="headerlink" title="2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection"></a>2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection</h3><p>After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.</p>
<p>The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking</h2><h3 id="Image-Tracking"><a href="#Image-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Image Tracking"></a>Image Tracking</h3><p>Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.</p>
<p>Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.</p>
<h3 id="Video-Tracking"><a href="#Video-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Video Tracking"></a>Video Tracking</h3><p>Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?"></a>Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?</h2><p>As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Background Clutter:</strong> The background can impact extracting an object’s features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Occlusion:</strong> This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Varying spatial scales:</strong> Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Tracking Speed:</strong> If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h2><p>After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.</p>
<h3 id="1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h3><p>Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:</p>
<p><strong>Target Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance Modeling</strong></p>
<p>Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Estimation</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object’s future position with precision.</p>
<p><strong>Target Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object’s location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target’s location more accurately.</p>
<h3 id="2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods Of Object Tracking"></a>2. Methods Of Object Tracking</h3><p>Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:</p>
<p><strong>OpenCV-Based Object Tracking</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking</strong> method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.</p>
<p><strong>MDNet</strong></p>
<p>Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.</p>
<p>The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSort</strong></p>
<p>DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.</p>
<p>DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ROLO</strong></p>
<p>ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.</p>

<p>Install the <em>pycharm</em> app on your PC, and launch it. Create a new project and go to <strong>Terminal.</strong> Install the <em>opencv-contrib-python</em> package by pasting the following command into the <strong>Terminal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Set Up the Trackers</strong></p>
<p>Now, create a Jupyter-notebook and set up the trackers with this code:</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cv2. version returns the OpenCV library version number.</li>
<li>Save the name of the eight trackers.</li>
<li>Check the list for the version you are working on and create a tracker object based on the number.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capture The Video Input</strong></p>
<p>For capturing the video input, write the following lines of code:</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the VideoCapture class to capture a video via the webcam or get a saved one from your PC.</li>
<li>In VideoCapture - line 2, give the path to your video.</li>
<li>Comment on the second line to use the webcam for tracking and uncomment the third one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating The Bounding Box And Initializing The Tracker</strong></p>
<p>Define an initial random bounding box or select the choices for the object you want to track with the following code:</p>
<p><strong>Start The Tracker And Check The Output</strong></p>
<p>Finally, write the below code lines to start the tracker:</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read each video frame.</li>
<li>Start the timer and, through the tracker, determine the trajectory of the object.</li>
<li>Use the trajectory to draw the bounding box.</li>
<li>The program will start tracking. Afterward, press the space bar to stop tracking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video – Object Tracking with Opencv and Python</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve discussed Object Tracking in detail and how it compares with Object Detection. Furthermore, we explored the methods used for tracking objects and provided complete guidance on the OpenCV Tracking method and its built-in functionalities.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you find this guide helpful, and you can now track objects in real-time without any issues.</p>

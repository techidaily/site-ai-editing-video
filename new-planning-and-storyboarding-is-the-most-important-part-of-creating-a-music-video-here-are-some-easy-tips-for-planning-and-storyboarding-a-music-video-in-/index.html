You can do it by creating rough sketches or storyboards. You can also film test footage to see how the concept will look on screen.</p>
<h5 id="Step5Effort-and-attention-to-detail"><a href="#Step5Effort-and-attention-to-detail" class="headerlink" title="Step5Effort and attention to detail"></a>Step5Effort and attention to detail</h5><p>Remember, this step is the foundation of your music video. So, take your time and don’t rush through it. By putting in effort and attention to detail, you’ll be able to create a visually stunning and closely tied to the song’s music video.</p>
<h2 id="Choose-a-style-for-your-music-video"><a href="#Choose-a-style-for-your-music-video" class="headerlink" title="Choose a style for your music video"></a>Choose a style for your music video</h2><p>While creating ideas for the music video, it’s also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:</p>

<h3 id="1-Performance-style-music-video"><a href="#1-Performance-style-music-video" class="headerlink" title="1.Performance-style music video"></a>1.Performance-style music video</h3><p>If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.</p>
<h3 id="2-Narrative-style-music-video"><a href="#2-Narrative-style-music-video" class="headerlink" title="2.Narrative-style music video"></a>2.Narrative-style music video</h3><p>A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.</p>
<p>You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If the artist approves the direction of the video, it’s time to move on to storyboarding!</p>
<h2 id="Storyboard-your-music-video"><a href="#Storyboard-your-music-video" class="headerlink" title="Storyboard your music video"></a>Storyboard your music video</h2><p>Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding! It allows you to break down your music video visually and highlight key visual moments. It can save time and money and convey a clear idea to the team. You can do this on paper, a computer, or a tablet, whatever works best for you.

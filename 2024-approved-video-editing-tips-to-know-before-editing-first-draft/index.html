An object (usually a line) moves across the screen, revealing the next scene, while simultaneously removing (or wiping) the previous scene and when used properly, they can create a very powerful effect. It involves creative fading in and out transitions to give a more dramatic look.</p>

<li>4k, 8k, HD resolution</li>
</ol>
<p>The latest video editing software offer the export your edited video in multiple formats, out of which 4k, 8k and HD resolution formats are preferable for majority of the professional video editors. It is necessary that even after the video is uploaded to a platform, the pixels do not decrease and the quality of the video is maintained. Although attractive to the viewers, the higher the resolution, the more the data with which you must deal. It is suggested that a standard or default resolution is chosen to play and replay the video in different computers.</p>

<li>Compression rate, bit depth, bit</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of data the camera records each second is referred to as bit rate. Every single second of a video is subject to significant data processing by cameras. The higher the quality of the video, the more is the bit rate. Bit depth refers to the number of colors your camera can read per pixel. Common bit depths are 8-bit and 10-bit, which enable a camera to read 256 million or 1.07 billion colors respectively. To upload your edited video, a compression is usually required to convert your resolution to internet quality so that the upload can be made simpler, without distorting the video resolution.</p>

<h4 id="Method-1-Using-the-Timeline-Settings-1"><a href="#Method-1-Using-the-Timeline-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Using the Timeline Settings"></a>Method 1. Using the Timeline Settings</h4><p>Are you looking for a speedy and straightforward method to slow down a video? In this <strong>DaVinci Resolve slow motion smooth</strong>, speed is adjustable via percentage. Here is a step-by-step guide to commence this action in DaVinci:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After importing your clip into this software, bring it to the timeline. Then, right-click on this clip in the timeline; a selection panel will appear. In this panel, locate the “Retime Controls” option and click it.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="access remote controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Commencing this action will feature a speed change option on your clip. Click on the navigation icon adjacent to the speed percentage in the timeline clip. As this opens a dropdown menu, select the “Change Speed” option to continue. Further, select a slower percentage in the given panel to slow down your video.</p>

One of the most well-liked and widely used effects is the freeze frame effect, which creates a short frozen frame effect on clips.</p>
<p>You can use different video editing software to create this effect in videos. But not all of them come close to the easy-to-use functionality of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On a video, you can utilize this feature to freeze a specific reaction of the character on screen or add a dramatic effect for a pivotal moment, like scoring a touchdown.</p>
<p>Upon enabling this effect, the video clip automatically splits at the frozen moments. Users insert another image file for that duration and activate the background audio and effects. If you are wondering how to carry out this feature on Filmora, read all the steps involved here.</p>

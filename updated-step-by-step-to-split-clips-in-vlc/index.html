<p>According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The option to speed up or slow down individual clips is one of the most important capabilities of Premiere Pro.</p>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

                ></p>
<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1"><a href="#Method-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch"><a href="#Time-stretch" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes"><a href="#Using-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The option to speed up or slow down individual clips is one of the most important capabilities of Premiere Pro.</p>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-1"><a href="#Method-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-1"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-1"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-1"><a href="#Time-stretch-1" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-1"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-1" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-1"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-1" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-1"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-2"><a href="#Method-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-2"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-2"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-2"><a href="#Time-stretch-2" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-2"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-2" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-2"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-2" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-2"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-3"><a href="#Method-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-3"><a href="#Time-stretch-3" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-3"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-3"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-3" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-3"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective"><a href="#Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective"></a>Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective</h5><p>Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2-Assess-Overall-Quality"><a href="#Step-2-Assess-Overall-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Assess Overall Quality"></a>Step 2 Assess Overall Quality</h5><p>On your journey of finding video marketing companies, you will come across many agencies that will look very promising, apparently. But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.</p>

<h5 id="Step-3-Give-Priority-to-Experience"><a href="#Step-3-Give-Priority-to-Experience" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Give Priority to Experience"></a>Step 3 Give Priority to Experience</h5><p>Selecting a marketing video agency without past experience with companies in your industry will be a blunder. This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.</p>

<h5 id="Step-4-Check-Customer-Testimonials"><a href="#Step-4-Check-Customer-Testimonials" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials"></a>Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials</h5><p>Checking out the reviews of past clients and customers is an essential part of selection. Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.</p>

<h5 id="Step-5-Watch-out-for-Creativity"><a href="#Step-5-Watch-out-for-Creativity" class="headerlink" title="Step 5 Watch out for Creativity"></a>Step 5 Watch out for Creativity</h5><p>Creativity differentiates between excellence and average in the video marketing world. Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.</p>
<p>Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency’s creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.</p>

<h5 id="Step-6-Take-Optimization-Seriously"><a href="#Step-6-Take-Optimization-Seriously" class="headerlink" title="Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously"></a>Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously</h5><p>Creative video content is useless if it cannot reach the most targeted audiences. The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a <strong>marketing video agency</strong> near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.</p>
<p>Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.</p>

<h5 id="Step-7-Dive-Into-the-Process"><a href="#Step-7-Dive-Into-the-Process" class="headerlink" title="Step 7 Dive Into the Process"></a>Step 7 Dive Into the Process</h5><p>You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.</p>
<p>Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.</p>

<h5 id="Step-8-Focus-on-Communication"><a href="#Step-8-Focus-on-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Step 8 Focus on Communication"></a>Step 8 Focus on Communication</h5><p>Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the <strong>video marketing company</strong>. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.</p>
<p>Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.</p>

It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.</p>
<p>You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.</p>

Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.</p>
<p>Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency’s creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-1"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-2"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

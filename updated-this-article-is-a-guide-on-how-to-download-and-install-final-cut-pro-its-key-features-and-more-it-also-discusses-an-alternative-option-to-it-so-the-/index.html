This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological. In fact, we can say that the horror movies of the 90s laid the foundation for current horror movies. So, without wasting time, let’s create a 1990s horror movie similar to The Blair Witch Project.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you’ve watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It’s even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.</p>

                      alt="add the horror video to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.</p>

                      alt="apply color grading"
                ></p>
<p>Next, double-click the horror clip and go to the <strong>Color</strong> menu. Then, click the <strong>Tone</strong> arrow before lowering the <strong>Saturation</strong> to -50%. This will give us a less saturated look popularly used in horror films.</p>

                      alt="double-click the horror clip"
                ></p>
<p>Now click the <strong>3D LUT</strong> option and choose a LUT that works for your film. For this horror film project, we’ll select the <strong>Dark Film</strong> option.</p>

                      alt="add creepiness to the video"
                ></p>
<p>Obviously, you’ll want your horror film to look as creepy as possible. To achieve that, click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab, then search for the <strong>Smokescreen 1</strong> effect. Move the effect to the timeline above the video track before trimming the effect clip to fit with the original horror video.</p>

                      alt="click the elements tab"
                ></p>
<p>We’ll now change the size and positioning of the smokescreen effect to match the feature video. To do that, double-click the effect track. You can also reduce the opacity to around 30% to make the smoke more visible.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now we’ll make the film more believable by adding a retro overlay. Click the <strong>Effects</strong> tab, then search for <strong>Retro Film Overlay 15</strong> before dragging and dropping the effect above all the tracks in the editing timeline.</p>

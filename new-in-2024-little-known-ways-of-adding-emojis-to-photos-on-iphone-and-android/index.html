<p>Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.</p>
<p>Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.</p>
<p>While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.</p>
<p>What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.</p>

<p>Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.</p>
<p>Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.</p>
<p>While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.</p>

The website has several fantastic features, like the ability to enable subtitles for each video and the availability of the whole Khan Academy course in at least 18 other languages.</p>
<p>However, it would be convenient if the text-only material could use the built-in text-to-speech feature. Students may now access all courses using the Khan Academy app, which also enables downloading for offline learning. It’s doubtful that many students will open Khan Academy and be eager to start using it because its organization and interface are both rather formal, and its activities are simple.</p>

<p><strong>Is National Geographic Kids suitable for learning?</strong></p>
<p>The National Geographic Kids website is easy to navigate and contains exciting materials for students, while some content isn’t properly structured and may be challenging to find. Clicking on a menu choice at the top of the screen leads you to a related page, but lingering over that same option brings up extra alternatives that you wouldn’t see if you clicked. Keyword searches and links supplied by the teacher will be helpful here. For example, the site has tools such as a Homework Help section that teaches kids how to be an expert fact-checker, write an animal report, and more. Still, it’s not precisely apparent how to get there unless you search for it.</p>

It is a great way to learn, allowing the students to build a visual model in their minds by watching their videos. The graphical representation of the ideas aids their comprehension, piques their interest, and promotes self-directed learning in each learner. Educational videos in NeoK12 and games are possibly one of the most effective learning tools. Even the higher levels of students will find the platform enriching and entertaining. NeoK12’s website also features tools not only for learners but also for teachers.</p>

<p><strong>Is NeoK12 suitable for learning?</strong></p>
<p>This platform is a rather extensive library of interesting educational tools, and the films and brain games are both free and well worth a look. Kids may augment the movie with other resources, such as interactive diagrams, flowcharts, fun, and puzzles, for a relatively inexpensive monthly charge. The films are simple teaching tools that usually contain supplementary resources that help youngsters to put what they’ve learned into practice. There are various “Universe” films, for example, under the Earth and Space area. Children who watch these films may also access relevant games, diagrams, activities, and photographs to prepare presentations.</p>

Discovery Education is used by almost 5.6 million students in Canada, all 50 states, and other countries. Why not give it a shot in the Philippines or somewhere else in Asia?</p>

<p>Teachers can use the free resources on Discovery Education to enhance their existing curriculum from the Grade School Level up to High School Level. An example of a tool with this platform is the Puzzlemaker, whose vocabulary makes crosswords and other types of puzzles. They can also be assigned specific videos or interactive activities to introduce new ideas at home.</p>
<p><strong>Is Discovery Education suitable for learning?</strong></p>
<p>Discovery Education is an excellent free resource. The commercial edition has considerably more resources, and after using it, I sincerely wished they would make it accessible for free or at a lower cost. The items aimed at students are straightforward and uninspiring; the website is intended for teachers. I would love to see them unlock more of the stuff that is locked behind the barrier, maybe in a cyclical manner where some films or resources are made available for free for a month at a time.</p>

<p>If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you <strong>create a risograph effect in Photoshop</strong> quickly!</p>
<p>Without further delay, let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial!</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Risograph-Effect"><a href="#What-Is-Risograph-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What Is Risograph Effect?"></a>What Is Risograph Effect?</h2><p>Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop <a href="#_How_To_Use">in the later part of this article</a>, let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.</p>
<p>Risograph was created in <strong>1986</strong> by a Japanese company called <strong>Riso Kagaku Corporation.</strong> It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph’s unique charm and distinct look.</p>
<p>The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.</p>

<p>Firstly, we will focus on how to use Photoshop in the following way to create the primary risograph effect.</p>
<h3 id="How-To-Create-the-Basic-Risograph-Effect-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-To-Create-the-Basic-Risograph-Effect-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop"></a>How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop</h3><p>Step1 Launch <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/"><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></a> on your laptop&#x2F;desktop (For this tutorial, we are using Photoshop CC 2021). Click <strong>“Create New,”</strong> select the document size, and click <strong>“Create.”</strong> Now set a paper-like textured layer on the canvas. Click <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + N,”</strong> and in the new layer window, set the mode to <strong>“Multiply.”</strong> Click <strong>“OK.”</strong> to confirm your action.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adding new layer to create risograph effect in photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Next, press <strong>“Ctrl+Shift+E”</strong> to combine your layers and select the <strong>“Edit”</strong> option from the top toolbar. Scroll down and select <strong>“Define Pattern.”</strong> Set the pattern name and click <strong>“OK.”</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="select edit option"
                ></p>
<p>Click <strong>“Layer”</strong> from the toolbar and choose <strong>“New Fill Layer”&gt; “Pattern.”</strong> Next, select your new pattern layer and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to get a grid layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose new fill layer"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Let’s place an object&#x2F;subject onto our canvas. Set the issue to “<strong>Multiply</strong>,” right-click on it and choose “<strong>Convert to Smart Object</strong>.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="choose convert to smart object"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 To add a Gradient Map Layer, click <strong>“Layer,”</strong> scroll down and click <strong>“New Adjustment Layer.”</strong> Select <strong>“Gradient Map…”</strong> from the drop-down menu and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to confirm.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Use the <strong>“Properties”</strong> panel and select the <strong>“gradient”</strong> colors. Here we’ve chosen shades of <strong>“White”</strong> and <strong>“Red.”</strong> Click <strong>“OK”</strong> to apply.</p>

                      alt="select the gradient color"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 For the image to have less contrast, click <strong>“Image”</strong> in the top toolbar and click <strong>“Adjustments.”</strong> Select <strong>“Levels…”</strong> from the menu. Now, set the black output to <strong>73.</strong></p>

                      alt="click image"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, click <strong>“Filter”</strong> and open the <strong>“Filter Gallery.”</strong> Select <strong>“Sketch” &gt; “Torn Edge,”</strong> set Image balance to <strong>30,</strong> smoothness, and contrast to <strong>15, 15</strong> respectively. Click <strong>“OK”</strong> to apply the changes.</p>

<h3 id="How-To-Create-A-Dual-Tone-Risograph-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-A-Dual-Tone-Risograph-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect"></a>How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect</h3><p>After creating an image with the risograph effect, how to make it more visually vertical? At this time, the dual-tone impact will help us have a more delicate picture.</p>
<p>The dual-tone effect is a technique in the risograph effect that combines two or more overlapping images to give a more vibrant look to the final project or emphasize the critical concept, information, or idea.</p>
<p>To create a dual-tone risograph effect in Photoshop, do the following steps.</p>
<p>Step1 To create a dual-tone risograph effect, add another subject to the canvas and set the blending mode to <strong>Multiply.</strong> Also, change its opacity to blend the two issues well. Make sure to turn the subject to <strong>Smart Object</strong> by right-clicking on the object’s layer and selecting <strong>“Convert to Smart Object.”</strong> Adjust the position of the subject on the previous one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add another subject to the canvas"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Select the layer of the new subject and click <strong>“Layer”</strong> Click <strong>“New Adjustment Layer”</strong> and select <strong>“Gradient Map…”</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Open the Gradient Editor and set the gradient colors of the new subject. Click <strong>“OK”</strong> to confirm. Click <strong>“Image”</strong> and choose <strong>“Adjustments”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Select <strong>“Levels”</strong> and set the <strong>Black Output</strong> to <strong>73.</strong></p>
<p>Step3 Click <strong>“Filter”</strong> and open <strong>“Filter Gallery.”</strong> Navigate to <strong>“Swatches” &gt; “Torn Edge”</strong> and set the <strong>Image Balance, Smoothness, and Contrast</strong> to <strong>30, 15, and 15,</strong> respectively, if you want to smooth down the subject.</p>
<p>Finally, your dual-tone effect is created in Photoshop!</p>
<h3 id="How-To-Blend-Images-Using-Layer-Modes"><a href="#How-To-Blend-Images-Using-Layer-Modes" class="headerlink" title="How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes"></a>How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes</h3><p>In this part, let’s see how to use the layer modes to add another subject to the canvas and blend it with the previous ones.</p>
<p>Step1 Place the new subject on the canvas and set the layer mode to <strong>Multiply</strong> by pressing the <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + N”</strong> and selecting <strong>“Multiply”</strong> from the drop-down menu in the new pop-up window. Click <strong>“Ok”</strong> to apply your changes.</p>
<p>To adjust the size of the object, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> from the top toolbar, and select <strong>“Transform.”</strong> From the drop-down menu, select <strong>“Scale.”</strong> Use the handles to make the object smaller or larger.</p>
<p>Step2 Click the <strong>“Move”</strong> icon from the left menu and drag the object to set its position. Now, copy and clip the <strong>Gradient mode</strong> from the main subject to the new one.</p>
<p>Step3 Apply the <strong>Level</strong> and <strong>Filter Galler</strong> to the new object (Same settings as the main subject). That’s it. You’ve successfully blended images using the layer mode.</p>

<p>Brighter videos always attract more attention. Indeed, a well-lit video can make your content shine and bring out the best in your story. But what if you forgot to turn on the lights or the camera just couldn’t handle the situation? We’ve all been there: you’re shooting a video, but there aren’t enough light sources. You end up with dark footage. It’s impossible to share this on your social media accounts or with your friends and family.</p>

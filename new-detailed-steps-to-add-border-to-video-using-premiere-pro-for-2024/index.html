It makes the video eye-catching and gives a vivid effect. It also fixes the automated cropping issues, especially on Instagram. Along with this, it helps the viewers to watch the video as you can add effects about fun, travel, guides and etc. accordingly. Adding a border is super easy and it’s not more than fun!</p>
<p>So let’s start…</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Add-Borders-to-Videos-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Add-Borders-to-Videos-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro"></a><strong>How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro</strong></h2><p>Today we are going to discuss how to add borders to the video clips or images in premiere pro. It’s pretty simple to make borders of different colors and sizes for your video clips.</p>
<p>So, here are the two different ways we can use to add borders to our videos or images.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a border to the video using a grid effect</li>
<li>Adding a border to the video using the essential graphics panel</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Way-1-Using-a-Grid-Effect"><a href="#Way-1-Using-a-Grid-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Using a Grid Effect"></a><strong>Way 1.</strong> <strong>Using a Grid Effect</strong></h3><p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>anchor value</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for the x and y.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>size</strong> to <strong>width and height slider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>1920</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to <strong>1080</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have borders added as you can see below.</p>
<p>You can also change the width of the borders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>30</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to change the color of the border.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>blending mode</strong> to <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>color picker</strong> tool and change the color of your desire.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the Essential Graphics Panel"></a><strong>Way 2.</strong> <strong>Using the Essential Graphics Panel</strong></h3><p>First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<p>Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Import</strong> the videos and drag them into the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>effects</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Find <strong>“alpha adjust”</strong> and drag it into the effects control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>4-point polygon mask</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Again go to effect controls, under <strong>opacity</strong> hit <strong>invert alpha</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <strong>mask</strong> hit <strong>inverted</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>motion</strong> settings, change the <strong>position</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Alpha adjust</strong> and set the <strong>mask feathering</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now go back to the <strong>effects</strong> panel and search the <strong>paint bucket</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under effects controls, hit the <strong>alpha channel</strong> under the <strong>fill selector</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Then hit <strong>stroke</strong> under the <strong>stroke</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can turn up the <strong>stroke width</strong> to make it a bit thicker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>color</strong> tab to change the color of the border as desired.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>We have discussed different software to add borders. All the software and tools are free to use. Similarly, they can be used on both Mac as well as Windows. They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders. You can use any one of them to make your borders and can easily engage viewers in your videos.</p>
<p>In all of the above applications, I recommend you to use <strong>Wondershare filmora 11</strong>. It is the most professional software and makes your video stand out.</p>
<p><strong>Way 1.</strong> <strong>Using a Grid Effect</strong></p>
<p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>anchor value</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for the x and y.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>size</strong> to <strong>width and height slider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>1920</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to <strong>1080</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have borders added as you can see below.</p>
<p>You can also change the width of the borders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>30</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to change the color of the border.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>blending mode</strong> to <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>color picker</strong> tool and change the color of your desire.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel-2"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel-2" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the Essential Graphics Panel"></a><strong>Way 2.</strong> <strong>Using the Essential Graphics Panel</strong></h3><p>First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<p>Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Import</strong> the videos and drag them into the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>effects</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Find <strong>“alpha adjust”</strong> and drag it into the effects control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>4-point polygon mask</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Again go to effect controls, under <strong>opacity</strong> hit <strong>invert alpha</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <strong>mask</strong> hit <strong>inverted</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>motion</strong> settings, change the <strong>position</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Alpha adjust</strong> and set the <strong>mask feathering</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now go back to the <strong>effects</strong> panel and search the <strong>paint bucket</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under effects controls, hit the <strong>alpha channel</strong> under the <strong>fill selector</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Then hit <strong>stroke</strong> under the <strong>stroke</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can turn up the <strong>stroke width</strong> to make it a bit thicker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>color</strong> tab to change the color of the border as desired.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>We have discussed different software to add borders. All the software and tools are free to use. Similarly, they can be used on both Mac as well as Windows. They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders.

<p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>anchor value</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for the x and y.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>size</strong> to <strong>width and height slider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>1920</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to <strong>1080</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have borders added as you can see below.</p>
<p>You can also change the width of the borders.</p>

<h2 id="1-What-is-an-intro-video"><a href="#1-What-is-an-intro-video" class="headerlink" title="1. What is an intro video?"></a>1. What is an intro video?</h2><p>A video intro is a brief introduction, typically lasting between 5 and 15 seconds, that introduces your video, YouTube channel, or brand. Video intros are becoming increasingly popular. It is often the first occasion on which a viewer will have the chance to interact with the content you produce.</p>
<p>Because of this, it has the power to attract attention from the very beginning and to develop trust in the company or product that you are promoting. It goes without saying that this is one of the most critical factors to consider when trying to attract and connect with your desired audience.</p>

<h3 id="Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Adobe After Effects"></a>Adobe After Effects</h3><p>One of the most well-known pieces of software for creating video effects is called Adobe After Effects. It is capable of producing great motion graphics, and as a result, it should have no trouble animating and producing dynamic video intros or 3D intros for your company, brand, or YouTube channel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg"
                      alt="adobe after effects intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe’s Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.</p>
<h3 id="Canva"><a href="#Canva" class="headerlink" title="Canva"></a>Canva</h3><p>When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere. In addition to providing, you with intro templates, it also gives you the ability to design your own logo. With a freshly designed logo in hand, now would be the ideal time to produce an introduction film using it.</p>
<p>Canva’s mission is to demystify graphic design and make it available to users who are not designers. They also provide a premium edition of Canva, which is ideally suited for teams to collaborate on the creation of designs with the same objective in mind. In addition, Canva Pro is equipped with additional premium features, such as a brand kit and a backdrop remover.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg"
                      alt="canva intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>Canva is an easy-to-use website that provides free access to some of its features, which may be used to create great movies. However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.</p>
<p>When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.</p>
<p>We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.</p>
<h3 id="Promo"><a href="#Promo" class="headerlink" title="Promo"></a>Promo</h3><p>Promo has a wonderful look that pops. You may build quick video intros for your social media or YouTube channel by using their intro maker, and then post and share them on your social networks afterwards. Promo.com provides filmmakers and video editors with high-quality professional video clips, royalty-free music, adjustable video templates, bespoke text, and logos, and more through their monthly membership programs. You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.</p>
<p>To summarize, Promo is a video maker that has an impressive design and allows for direct uploads to various social media platforms. The only problem is that their website occasionally becomes unresponsive and sluggish. Because of this, the process of creation can become rather laborious and drawn out.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Promo.com is my one-stop-shop for all of my business promotional videos because it offers a variety of video ad templates that I can easily edit on my browser without the need for any program, and they also offer a great selection of stock footage and text overlay options to make the videos look more professional.

<p>1. What is an intro video?</p>
<p>A video intro is a brief introduction, typically lasting between 5 and 15 seconds, that introduces your video, YouTube channel, or brand. Video intros are becoming increasingly popular. It is often the first occasion on which a viewer will have the chance to interact with the content you produce.</p>
<p>Because of this, it has the power to attract attention from the very beginning and to develop trust in the company or product that you are promoting. It goes without saying that this is one of the most critical factors to consider when trying to attract and connect with your desired audience.</p>

<h3 id="Adobe-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Adobe-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Adobe After Effects"></a>Adobe After Effects</h3><p>One of the most well-known pieces of software for creating video effects is called Adobe After Effects. It is capable of producing great motion graphics, and as a result, it should have no trouble animating and producing dynamic video intros or 3D intros for your company, brand, or YouTube channel.</p>

                      alt="adobe after effects intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe’s Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.</p>
<h3 id="Canva-1"><a href="#Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Canva"></a>Canva</h3><p>When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere. In addition to providing, you with intro templates, it also gives you the ability to design your own logo. With a freshly designed logo in hand, now would be the ideal time to produce an introduction film using it.</p>
<p>Canva’s mission is to demystify graphic design and make it available to users who are not designers. They also provide a premium edition of Canva, which is ideally suited for teams to collaborate on the creation of designs with the same objective in mind. In addition, Canva Pro is equipped with additional premium features, such as a brand kit and a backdrop remover.</p>

                      alt="canva intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>Canva is an easy-to-use website that provides free access to some of its features, which may be used to create great movies. However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.</p>
<p>When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.</p>
<p>We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.</p>
<h3 id="Promo-1"><a href="#Promo-1" class="headerlink" title="Promo"></a>Promo</h3><p>Promo has a wonderful look that pops. You may build quick video intros for your social media or YouTube channel by using their intro maker, and then post and share them on your social networks afterwards.

You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.</p>
<p>To summarize, Promo is a video maker that has an impressive design and allows for direct uploads to various social media platforms. The only problem is that their website occasionally becomes unresponsive and sluggish. Because of this, the process of creation can become rather laborious and drawn out.</p>

<p>Anime flicks boast of having the capability to entertain the audience with an element of uniqueness, owing to a series of characteristics. Some of the prominent ones are, complex and engaging storylines, exaggeration of physical features and a light tint of animation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What makes anime movies rank high on viewer preference?</strong></p>
<p>Amine movies are a storehouse of fantasy and adventure, taking you to an imaginary world of nail-biting stories. Making a more generous use of narration and vision, in comparison to live action flicks, they tend to unfold the content plot in such a way that suits the animation genre ahead of any other style.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Which movie marked the entry of anime flicks into the entertainment world?</strong></p>
<p>Namakura Gatana, also referred to as Blunt Sword, was directed in 1917. The latter was then released in Japan as the inaugural anime movie sometime later. However, the fact that which of the two titles took the actual credit, still happens to be a mystery.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the fundamental classification of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>As of now, the aforesaid Japanese animation style is classified into 5 major categories, each aimed at addressing a specific class of viewer preferences. The 5 types are, Kodomomuke, Josei, Seinen, Shojo and Shonen.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the existing count of anime movies?</strong></p>
<p>According to the latest updates, the cumulative count of anime movies is ahead of 6000 at present. Additionally, around 3200 anime series have been telecasted till date. It is further, interesting to know that Japan takes the credit of making more than 60% of the total anime content being viewed across the globe.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Anime movies 2020 are a trend of fantasy and fiction that takes you to a superficial world of fun-filled adventure and entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The never-ending list of wholesome anime movies extends every year in proportion with the increasing popularity earned by these amazing motion graphic creations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> While there are already a host of anime flicks for movie lovers to crave for, the coming year is all set to bring in new surprises with some amazing content releases.</p>

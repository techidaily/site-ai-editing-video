                      alt="DVD Slideshow Builder Deluxe- Mode Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Software Registration</strong></p>
<p>For an extensive working flexibility it is recommended to purchase a licensed version of the software program. All you need to do is, navigate to and click on the ‘Register’ option at the top right corner of the program’s launch screen, followed by choosing the ‘Buy Now’ option. Follow the successive screen to place your order.</p>
<p>As soon as your order gets validated, you will receive an auto-generated confirmation e-mail containing the registration code within. Proceed with copying and pasting the same, along with the licensed e-mail to see the <strong>DVD Slideshow Builder Deluxe</strong> program get activated.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Browse Through the Program Interface</strong></p>
<p>As you enter into the program’s workspace after completing the registration process, the latter’s welcome interface greets you with the following elements:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Navigation Bar</strong></p>
<p>The navigation bar at the top consists of the entire set of slideshow editing functions, including the specific effects, personalized custom styles and output options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Library</strong></p>
<p>The program library is a host of slideshow contents that vary in accordance with the specific function of the ‘Navigation Bar’ you are working with. For instance, if you are currently within the ‘Organize’ tab, the library presents before you a list of the created slideshow projects.</p>
<p>Further, in the ‘Personalize’ editing tab, you get to see the variety of editing tools, like, clipart, effects, styles, intro&#x2F;credit and pre-audio options, along with a set of other features. The output options and settings get displayed in the library within the ‘Create’ tab of the navigation bar.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Preview Window</strong></p>
<p>It is here that you can watch a display and run of the current slide of your created presentation on the editor’s Timeline or Storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Storyboard&#x2F;Timeline</strong></p>
<p>These are the regions within the program’s workspace where you can work with creating and editing your slideshow presentation. If you choose to work in the previously explained ‘Personalize’ mode, there is an option to switch between the Storyboard and the Timeline whenever the need arises.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Switching Between the Working Modes</strong></p>

You can do this by reaching to and clicking on the ‘Blue Button’ at the top, beside the ‘Navigation Bar’, followed by selecting the ‘Switch to Advanced&#x2F;Standard Mode’ option from the dropdown menu that appears next.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Creating a Slideshow Presentation</strong></p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

<p>So, you might have understood why there is a need for <strong>converting slides to pictures.</strong> Now, let’s dig down more on the topic.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

<p>After the video is added to the veed.io page, it will take some time to upload it to the project menu. You can add multiple files by clicking on the “Add” option available on the screen. After a short while, you will see the video preview on the screen along with a timeline of the video.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="preview video speed controller"
                ></p>
<p>Click on the timeline feature and there will be different tools from veed.io available at the bottom of the interface. Select the speedometer type icon on the screen and this will give you access to control the playback speed of timelapse.</p>
<p>You can drag the cursor from 1X to any desired speed here. Just click on the drag button and lower the speed below 1X to a desirable speed of your choice. In the preview window, check how the video is being rendered.</p>
<p>When you are satisfied with the changes and the video speed seems normal to you, go to the top right corner of the screen and click on the “Export” option. This will ask you to set your preferences for different video settings. Change them according to your requirement and then the video will be downloaded to your device.</p>

The primary motive of this discussion is to provide you with the best-in-class motion tracker.</p>
<p>Not only will we tell you the name of the software, but we will also guide you through the procedure of doing this. Moreover, many of you don’t know what motion tracking is. So, this article will also provide significant information about this.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Motion-Tracking-in-Video-Editing"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Motion-Tracking-in-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?"></a>Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Motion tracking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> helps you analyze the movements of different objects in your video content. This process involves various tasks that can be very helpful in video editing. For example, tracking and identifying the position of elements over time. The main purpose of motion tracking is to add graphics. Moreover, you can also add digital effects to the tracked objects.</p>
<p>You will need special software or video editing tools to perform this process. Here’s how you can understand the motion tracking process with ease:</p>
<h3 id="Selection-of-Object"><a href="#Selection-of-Object" class="headerlink" title="Selection of Object"></a>Selection of Object</h3><p>The editor can select the object that he wants to track in an effective manner. This object can be a person or any moving element that needs tracking. Moreover, it can also be a moving vehicle or a logo as well. Tracking these moving elements in the frame can allow the editor to improve the areas which have high contrast or distinct features.</p>
<h3 id="Tracking-Points"><a href="#Tracking-Points" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Points"></a>Tracking Points</h3><p>Selecting the object allows the software to identify specific points in the frame. These points can have distinct features or a high contrast that may affect the video quality. With the help of <strong>video motion tracking</strong>, the editor can note down these areas and improve them to enhance the viewer experience.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Mapping"><a href="#Data-Mapping" class="headerlink" title="Data Mapping"></a>Data Mapping</h3><p>Once the software tracks the movements, it can be very useful for the editor. This is because it calculates the changes in position and rotation of each point. Moreover, it also maps the tracked data into a visual representation for the coordinating system. Using this system, the movements of the objects can be recreated in a 3D space.</p>
<h3 id="Using-Effects-and-Refinement"><a href="#Using-Effects-and-Refinement" class="headerlink" title="Using Effects and Refinement"></a>Using Effects and Refinement</h3><p>After obtaining the motion tracking data, the video editor can apply different effects on the object. These effects can include adding graphics and text to the scene. Moreover, it can also help in animation or compositing visual elements. To ensure the accurate alignment of the effects, the editor may need to use extra tracking techniques or manual adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import Video in Filmora</p>
<p>To get started, launch Filmora on your device, select “New Project,” and choose the “Click here to import media” option. To proceed, add the video you want to apply motion tracking. Once the video is visible in the “Import Media” section, drag it to “Timeline.”</p>

                      alt="import video to filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add Motion Tracking in the Video</p>
<p>Select the video in “Timeline” and click the “Motion Tracking” button from the “Toolbar” present above the “Timeline.” Conversely, double-click the video and choose the “Video” tab from the editing settings.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Customize Motion Tracking and Initiate It</p>
<p>To enable the box customization, double-click the “Motion Tracking Box.” Drag the “Motion Tracking Box” on the moving object and cover the whole object in the box. You can also adjust the duration of motion tracking by trimming the video in the timeline. Once done, click the “Click to start Motion Track” button and wait a few moments.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add Elements or Effects to the Video</p>
<p>Next, select “OK” from the prompt window and go to the “Element” section. Choose an “Element” and drag it into “Timeline” above your video section. To adjust the element, you must double-click on it. There is no restriction on using an element, as you can add “Effects” or other things.</p>
<p>You need to revert to the “Motion Tracking” section and select the drop-down appearing against the option. Choose the name of your “Effect” or “Element” that you’ve applied to before. The particular motion track will be enhanced through an effect or element.</p>

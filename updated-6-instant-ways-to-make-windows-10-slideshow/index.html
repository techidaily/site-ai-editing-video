Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let’s dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:</p>
<h3 id="What-Does-It-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Does-It-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Look Like"></a>What Does It Look Like</h3><p>Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file’s title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.</p>

<h3 id="Timecode-Format"><a href="#Timecode-Format" class="headerlink" title="Timecode Format"></a>Timecode Format</h3><p>The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.</p>
<h3 id="Metadata"><a href="#Metadata" class="headerlink" title="Metadata"></a>Metadata</h3><p>A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline"><a href="#Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline" class="headerlink" title="Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)"></a>Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)</h3><p>Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.</p>
<h3 id="Advanced-Styling-Fonts"><a href="#Advanced-Styling-Fonts" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Styling Fonts"></a>Advanced Styling Fonts</h3><p>Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.</p>
<h3 id="Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles"><a href="#Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles"></a>Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles</h3><p>Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.</p>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer.

<li>Lastly, remove 1 from the start of each time code. For example, if the time code is “100:00:11.580,” write “00:00:11.580”.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Change the extension from SRT to VVT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now save all the changes, rename it by replacing the suffix “SRT ‘’ with “VVT .’’</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Go to view</li>
<li>Click on the check box for “File name extensions”</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="check file name extensions"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can easily change the extension from SRT to VVT.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="hit yes and the extension will be changed"
                ></p>
<p>The manual process is not too difficult. It can be extremely time taking to change each time code and adding blank lines in between. However, this is an easy fix when you cannot access a converter.</p>

<h2 id="Is-Web-VTT-the-Same-as-SRT-1"><a href="#Is-Web-VTT-the-Same-as-SRT-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?"></a>Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?</h2><p>While SRT is a popular text file used for captions, Web VTT is not far behind. Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let’s dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:</p>
<h3 id="What-Does-It-Look-Like-1"><a href="#What-Does-It-Look-Like-1" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Look Like"></a>What Does It Look Like</h3><p>Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file’s title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.</p>

<h3 id="Timecode-Format-1"><a href="#Timecode-Format-1" class="headerlink" title="Timecode Format"></a>Timecode Format</h3><p>The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.</p>
<h3 id="Metadata-1"><a href="#Metadata-1" class="headerlink" title="Metadata"></a>Metadata</h3><p>A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline-1"><a href="#Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline-1" class="headerlink" title="Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)"></a>Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)</h3><p>Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.</p>
<h3 id="Advanced-Styling-Fonts-1"><a href="#Advanced-Styling-Fonts-1" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Styling Fonts"></a>Advanced Styling Fonts</h3><p>Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.</p>
<h3 id="Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles-1"><a href="#Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles-1" class="headerlink" title="Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles"></a>Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles</h3><p>Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.</p>
<h3 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer. Apart from differences in styling, time, and text formats, Web VTT files are incredibly easier to read and edit. You can also add comments which will remain hidden from the display.</p>

<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-2"><a href="#Summary-2" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>

<p><strong>1. Create folders in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>If you have footage from multiple cameras, it is best to create some folders first.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-a-Folder-for-Camera-1-1"><a href="#Step1-Create-a-Folder-for-Camera-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create a Folder for Camera 1"></a>Step1 Create a Folder for Camera 1</h5><p>If you have video footage from three cameras, you can create one folder for each camera.</p>
<p>Go to the default folder on the top left and rename it Cam_A.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step2-Create-a-Folder-for-Camera-2-1"><a href="#Step2-Create-a-Folder-for-Camera-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Create a Folder for Camera 2"></a>Step2 Create a Folder for Camera 2</h5><p>Then go to the bottom left of the media browser and click on this icon to add a new folder. Rename it to Cam_B.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create a folder for camera 2"

Production sound is usually the sound that is recorded on set. If you have recorded all dialects from the subjects on the location, you can put them into this folder.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

These tracks are usually for picture editing that includes footage with no effects or some simple effects—for example resizing, keyframing, transitions, or Green Screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

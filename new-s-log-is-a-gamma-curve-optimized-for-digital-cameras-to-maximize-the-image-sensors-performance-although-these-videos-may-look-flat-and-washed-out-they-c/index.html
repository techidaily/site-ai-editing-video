Although These Videos May Look Flat and Washed Out, They Contain Lots of Color Information</h2><p>S-Log is a gamma curve optimized for digital cameras to maximize the image sensor’s performance. Although these videos may look flat and washed out, they contain lots of color information. Even better, video creators can use color correction to edit the S-Log videos and make them look as natural as possible. That’s what this article is all about.</p>

<h5 id="Step1-Adjust-the-color-settings"><a href="#Step1-Adjust-the-color-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Adjust the color settings"></a>Step1 Adjust the color settings</h5><p>Start by adding your video to the timeline on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and then double-click the video track.

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Read-and-study-the-histogram"><a href="#Step2-Read-and-study-the-histogram" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Read and study the histogram"></a>Step2 Read and study the histogram</h5><p>Now you’ll see the Advanced Color Correction pop-up window. Here, you’ll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3-Adjust-the-image-colors"><a href="#Step3-Adjust-the-image-colors" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Adjust the image colors"></a>Step3 Adjust the image colors</h5><p>Once you’ve understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif"
                      alt="adjust the image colors"
                ></p>
<p>After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the <strong>Light</strong> section, then adjust the <strong>Highlights</strong> to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn’t look pure white, increase the <strong>Whites</strong> slide to make it whiter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg"
                      alt="go to the light section"
                ></p>
<p>Now adjust the <strong>Shadows</strong> settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the <strong>Blacks</strong> slider to the left.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don’t cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Adjust-the-color-saturation"><a href="#Step4-Adjust-the-color-saturation" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Adjust the color saturation"></a>Step4 Adjust the color saturation</h5><p>Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the <strong>Color</strong> section and adjust the <strong>Saturation</strong> slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the <strong>Vibrance</strong> to make your video objects look more colorful.</p>

<h5 id="Step5-Preview-and-compare-the-video"><a href="#Step5-Preview-and-compare-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Preview and compare the video"></a>Step5 Preview and compare the video</h5><p>Now it’s time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the <strong>Eye</strong> icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the <strong>AB</strong> icon and choose <strong>Split View-Left&#x2F;Right</strong> to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.</p>

For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the <strong>Light</strong> section, then adjust the <strong>Highlights</strong> to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn’t look pure white, increase the <strong>Whites</strong> slide to make it whiter.</p>

<p>Now adjust the <strong>Shadows</strong> settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the <strong>Blacks</strong> slider to the left.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don’t cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

But you don’t have to worry about it anymore let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>What are you planning to use it for?</strong>: You must know the use of video editing software before picking one. Whether you are using it for gaming or creating ordinary YouTube videos. These decisions are very important to take before opting for downloading it from the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: You should keep in mind which editing software is complex to learn and which one is easy in comparison with that. If you didn’t keep this in mind you might end up wasting your time by downloading and trying in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

Here, we can make the structure of Subscribe channel graphics using different colors, icons, texts, and channel photos. We’ll start by adding color layers.</p>
<p><strong>1. Add color layers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the “Media” on the top left corner of the interface and Click on “Sample Color.” Here find the Green color and add it in the panel below as the first video layer by the drag-n-drop function.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-3.png"
                      alt="adding a bright green color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will key this layer at the end, so make sure not to use any other green graphics for your animation.</li>
<li>Let’s lock this layer because we will no longer use it. For this, click on the “Lock” icon on the layer’s left side.</li>
<li>Add white and red colors and stack them on top of the green color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-4.png"
                      alt="white and red color layers added"
                ></p>
<p>After adding all three color layers, it’s time to crop these layers to make the structure of our graphic.</p>
<h5 id="Crop-the-Color-Layers"><a href="#Crop-the-Color-Layers" class="headerlink" title="Crop the Color Layers"></a><strong>Crop the Color Layers</strong></h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Effects” tab from the top bar and search for the “Crop” effect. Then drag the effect and add it to the white and red layers on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-5.png"
                      alt="adding the crop effect on color layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the “Eye” icon beside the red color layer to hide it. Then double-click the white layer to see its properties. When the properties appear, select “Effects” from there.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-6.png"
                      alt="cropping the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also enable the safe zones from the display settings on the right side of the panel. After that, crop the white layer first, then show the red layer and crop it too. It will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-7.png"
                      alt="enabling the safe zones"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it, folks. Our color backgrounds are here. Now we have to add our channel photo to this. So let’s move on to see how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Add a channel photo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To add the channel photo, you can upload the image. Here we are going to use some images from the stock media. No matter the image, drop it down on the panel above the red color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-8.png"
                      alt="adding an image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click on the image layer, and from the properties, go to the “Mask” option and select the circle. You can also select any other shape you like.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-9.png"
                      alt="select a shape for our image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After that, scroll down and make the circle even by matching all numbers. Then scale it down and place it on the left corner of the white layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-10.png"
                      alt="adjusting the channel image"
                ></p>
<p>It’s done. Let’s add our channel text now.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Add texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For adding text, go to the “Titles” from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-11.png"
                      alt="adding the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-12.png"
                      alt="editing the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, let’s add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-13.png"
                      alt="subscribe button text added"
                ></p>
<p>We can’t finish our structure without icons, can we? So let’s move on to them.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Add icons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the “Element” from the top bar and search for the “Bell” icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-14.png"
                      alt="adding a bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-15.png"
                      alt="adding a freezeframe of the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the “Subscribe” text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-16.png"
                      alt="adjust the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, add “Thumbs Up” and “Mouse Cursor” icons on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-17.png"
                      alt="thumbs up and mouse cursor icons added"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our structure is finished. Now let’s start animating.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Animate-the-graphics"><a href="#Step3-Animate-the-graphics" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Animate the graphics"></a>Step3 Animate the graphics</h5><p>First, we’ll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the “Animation” option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking “Add.” Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-18.png"
                      alt="adding a new keyframe on the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-19.gif"
                      alt="successfully animated the graphics"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let’s correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the” Type Writer’ form and hit the “Advanced option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-20.png"
                      alt="selecting type writer style for text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Here, you can adjust the text with the color layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-21.png"
                      alt="adjusting the speed of the text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-22.gif"
                      alt="the speed of the text adjusted"
                ></p>
<p>If you’ve managed so far, then that’s great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let’s see it in detail.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor"><a href="#Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Animate the mouse cursor"></a>Step4 Animate the mouse cursor</h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Mouse Cursor” icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the “Thumbs Up” so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the subscribe button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png"
                      alt="adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the “Bell” icon.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-24.png"
                      alt="mouse curson on the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The last keyframe we have to add will place this “Mouse Cursor” icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving “Mouse Cursor’ icon according to your taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final product up till now will be like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="successfully animated the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<p>We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let’s dive right into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the graphics out"></a>Step5 Animate the graphics out</h5><p>The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here’s how it’s done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.</li>
<li>Now, from the “Animation” option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.</li>
<li>After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="removed the white color layer from the frame"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.</li>
<li>After it’s done, the whole graphics will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animated the color, image, and icons layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the “Advanced” settings, just like before.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on the advanced option"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it’s done, we will do the same for the “Subscribe” button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the text with your graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our graphic is completed. “Export” it from the software to your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="completed subscribe channel graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the “Green Screen” option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that’s all.</p>

Here, we can make the structure of Subscribe channel graphics using different colors, icons, texts, and channel photos. We’ll start by adding color layers.</p>
<p><strong>1. Add color layers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the “Media” on the top left corner of the interface and Click on “Sample Color.” Here find the Green color and add it in the panel below as the first video layer by the drag-n-drop function.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-3.png"
                      alt="adding a bright green color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will key this layer at the end, so make sure not to use any other green graphics for your animation.</li>
<li>Let’s lock this layer because we will no longer use it. For this, click on the “Lock” icon on the layer’s left side.</li>
<li>Add white and red colors and stack them on top of the green color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-4.png"
                      alt="white and red color layers added"
                ></p>
<p>After adding all three color layers, it’s time to crop these layers to make the structure of our graphic.</p>
<h5 id="Crop-the-Color-Layers-1"><a href="#Crop-the-Color-Layers-1" class="headerlink" title="Crop the Color Layers"></a><strong>Crop the Color Layers</strong></h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Effects” tab from the top bar and search for the “Crop” effect. Then drag the effect and add it to the white and red layers on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-5.png"
                      alt="adding the crop effect on color layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the “Eye” icon beside the red color layer to hide it. Then double-click the white layer to see its properties. When the properties appear, select “Effects” from there.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-6.png"
                      alt="cropping the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also enable the safe zones from the display settings on the right side of the panel. After that, crop the white layer first, then show the red layer and crop it too. It will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-7.png"
                      alt="enabling the safe zones"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it, folks. Our color backgrounds are here. Now we have to add our channel photo to this. So let’s move on to see how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Add a channel photo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To add the channel photo, you can upload the image. Here we are going to use some images from the stock media. No matter the image, drop it down on the panel above the red color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-8.png"
                      alt="adding an image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click on the image layer, and from the properties, go to the “Mask” option and select the circle. You can also select any other shape you like.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-9.png"
                      alt="select a shape for our image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After that, scroll down and make the circle even by matching all numbers. Then scale it down and place it on the left corner of the white layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-10.png"
                      alt="adjusting the channel image"
                ></p>
<p>It’s done. Let’s add our channel text now.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Add texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For adding text, go to the “Titles” from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-11.png"
                      alt="adding the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-12.png"
                      alt="editing the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, let’s add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-13.png"
                      alt="subscribe button text added"
                ></p>
<p>We can’t finish our structure without icons, can we? So let’s move on to them.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Add icons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the “Element” from the top bar and search for the “Bell” icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-14.png"
                      alt="adding a bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-15.png"
                      alt="adding a freezeframe of the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the “Subscribe” text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-16.png"
                      alt="adjust the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, add “Thumbs Up” and “Mouse Cursor” icons on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-17.png"
                      alt="thumbs up and mouse cursor icons added"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our structure is finished. Now let’s start animating.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Animate-the-graphics-1"><a href="#Step3-Animate-the-graphics-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Animate the graphics"></a>Step3 Animate the graphics</h5><p>First, we’ll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the “Animation” option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking “Add.” Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-18.png"
                      alt="adding a new keyframe on the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-19.gif"
                      alt="successfully animated the graphics"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let’s correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the” Type Writer’ form and hit the “Advanced option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-20.png"
                      alt="selecting type writer style for text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Here, you can adjust the text with the color layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-21.png"
                      alt="adjusting the speed of the text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-22.gif"
                      alt="the speed of the text adjusted"
                ></p>
<p>If you’ve managed so far, then that’s great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let’s see it in detail.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor-1"><a href="#Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Animate the mouse cursor"></a>Step4 Animate the mouse cursor</h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Mouse Cursor” icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the “Thumbs Up” so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the subscribe button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png"
                      alt="adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the “Bell” icon.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-24.png"
                      alt="mouse curson on the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The last keyframe we have to add will place this “Mouse Cursor” icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving “Mouse Cursor’ icon according to your taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final product up till now will be like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-25.gif"
                      alt="successfully animated the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<p>We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let’s dive right into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out-1"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the graphics out"></a>Step5 Animate the graphics out</h5><p>The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here’s how it’s done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.</li>
<li>Now, from the “Animation” option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.</li>
<li>After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-26.png"
                      alt="removed the white color layer from the frame"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.</li>
<li>After it’s done, the whole graphics will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-27.gif"
                      alt="animated the color, image, and icons layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the “Advanced” settings, just like before.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-28.png"
                      alt="click on the advanced option"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it’s done, we will do the same for the “Subscribe” button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-29.png"
                      alt="adjust the text with your graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our graphic is completed. “Export” it from the software to your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-30.png"
                      alt="completed subscribe channel graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the “Green Screen” option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that’s all.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Creating the Subscribe channel graphics is like picking stars from the sky for any video creator, especially if you are a beginner.

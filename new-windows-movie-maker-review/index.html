<p><strong>Step 1: Launch After Effects</strong></p>
<p>This one is an efficient motion graphics template that you can use to add a visible spunk to your graphic design artworks. Begin with launching the template in your system after an official website download of the same.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Film Ready</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to remove the black background in After Effects template, make sure that your footage is ready to take up the action.

<p><strong>Step 3: Add to Queue</strong></p>
<p>Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.</p>

<p>There are various types of political campaign video ideas. It all depends on your target audience and the cause you’re promoting. This section will provide you with four effective pollical campaign videos you can implement in your next political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>
<p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>

                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>

Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>
<p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg"
                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.</p>
<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>
<p><strong>Hold a Question &amp; Answer (Q&amp;A) Section</strong></p>

Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&amp;A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.</p>
<p><strong>Create Community-Focused Content</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>

There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-2.jpg"
                      alt="drag and drop the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Go to effects and then click “NewBlue FX” option and select Newblue filters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select newblue filter"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Find the Selective Color Effect and drag it onto the clip. The effect will be instantly applied.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-4.jpg"
                      alt="selective color effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Next, double-click on the clip and check out the effects menu at the top of the screen.</p>

                      alt="effects menu"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Open the preset drop-down menu. There will be a lot of presets with different colors. Select the preset you want to use. In this scenario, let us select Just Blue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the preset"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 If you see a blue tint at a place or object which you want to be white and black, click on the first color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="first color"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Now adjust the range slider to decrease the number of unwanted tints.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adjusting the range slider"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 To blur the edges of the effects, turn up the softened slider and remove any unwanted tint previously remaining.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="opening effects menu"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Click on the ‘first color’ and select the eye dropper tool. This will allow us to select the red flower in the preview window. You can also click different parts of the image to get the color that we want.</p>

                      alt="select the first color and eye dropper tool"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.</p>
<p><img

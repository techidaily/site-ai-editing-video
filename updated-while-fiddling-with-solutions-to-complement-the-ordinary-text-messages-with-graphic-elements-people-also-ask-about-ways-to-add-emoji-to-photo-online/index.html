<p>It’s difficult to make an intro in After Effects. To start, you must have a natural beginning that will catch the</p>
<p>viewer’s attention in the film you’ve made right away. Then, you can improve the caliber of your intros by using built-in filters, transition effects, overlays, animation, and more! Therefore, we’re confident that this article will be helpful to you if you’ve been trying to learn how to create After Effects intros of the highest level. Continue reading to learn more.</p>
<p>Let’s start off!</p>
<h2 id="1-Create-a-new-composition-for-your-intro"><a href="#1-Create-a-new-composition-for-your-intro" class="headerlink" title="1. Create a new composition for your intro"></a>1. Create a new composition for your intro</h2><p>You must build up your video’s composition based on the output. You can upload the previously recorded video after choosing the composition and the runtime. Right-click again and select “Pre-compose” from the menu that appears. To make it simpler to find later, you can also rename your movie here.</p>
<p>The composition can then include a solid layer. Follow *Layer &gt; New &gt; Solid* to get to this option. Additionally,</p>
<p>you can choose a hue based on the type of video you want to make. Additionally, you may use the Text option to build text layers, which will allow you to split the words at different points in the document. You can edit each word separately when you break it into layers. Finally, you can move the text around and change the color of the reader to make it more appropriate for your films.</p>
<p>After Effects makes it incredibly simple to edit the text composition and import it into the timeline of the film.</p>
<p>A panel appears on the right after importing a text composition. Here, you can alter the text’s color, position,</p>
<p>and size.</p>
<h2 id="2-Add-the-first-transition-layer"><a href="#2-Add-the-first-transition-layer" class="headerlink" title="2. Add the first transition layer"></a>2. Add the first transition layer</h2><p>By include the transition layer, you may use After Effects’ effects templates to apply a variety of effects to your</p>
<p>videos. You can experiment with a variety of transition layers in After Effects before selecting the ideal one (CC Light Wipe is a popular choice).</p>
<p>You can modify the transition after applying it to the layer. For instance, you may decide to apply the second</p>
<p>key transition at a later period in the timeline and configure the first key transition to occur immediately at the start of the timeline. Setting the completion value is crucial since it will influence how long the word will remain displayed in the video.</p>
<h2 id="3-Add-the-second-transition-layer"><a href="#3-Add-the-second-transition-layer" class="headerlink" title="3. Add the second transition layer"></a>3. Add the second transition layer</h2><p>The transition effect you introduced in the first stage can either be maintained here, or you can select an</p>
<p>entirely different one. According to how long you want the text to be displayed, add the layer and adjust</p>
<p>completion. The reader is invisible when the completion value is set to 100%, or the word is said when it is set</p>
<p>to 0%.</p>
<p><strong>A memory sketch</strong></p>
<p>If you want to make a black-and-white video that is more interesting, the memory sketch is a great template to use. You can make a visually beautiful video with its outstanding text captions, fluid transitions, and excellent animations.</p>
<p><strong>Toolkit for Instagram</strong></p>
<p>These days, Instagram is a very popular social media site. Instagram is a platform where reels and videos</p>
<p>flourish, therefore you must make every effort to differentiate your video from the millions of others available.</p>
<p>The Instagram Toolkit template meets the standards of the social media network by being brief, clear, and</p>
<p>appealing.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting sweep</strong></p>
<p>A final transition effect, which can be found in the *Effects &gt; Generate *section, must be added to the video in order to complete the effect. The final flourish can be added in the same way as the other keyframes. In this step, you can use the edge intensity, sweep intensity, and direction. This allows you to seamlessly combine the transition of words with lighting effects.</p>
<p>These are some quick and easy techniques to adding some intros to your videos that look professional. Let’s</p>
<p>also take a look at some well-known templates you may utilize to make perfect video intros. Because the initial few seconds of any video are so important, After Effects has put together some incredible templates that have a variety of video clips, images, text, sound effects, and music tracks. To produce the video you want, you must obtain the ideal template.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Utilizing templates will hasten your workflow even though it takes some time to become familiar with After</p>
<p>Effects’ various tools. To gain a feel for how After Effects functions, we advise playing around by adding some</p>
<p>clips and titles. When you do that, you will be well on your way to creating a fantastic intro for your upcoming</p>
<p>video project.</p>

Being a relatively new dimension of GIF editing, a merge of the two produces matchless and classic results. Read through the further article to get a complete guide for working on GIF creation and editing with Procreate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Before you begin creating a <strong>Procreate GIF</strong>, let’s get a bit familiar with the concept behind this GIF creation utility. This one is an excellent and advanced means of exploring your skills in digital drawing and animations. It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.</p>
<p>Procreate allows you to work with animation in its ‘Animation Assist’ tool, where you get a generous workspace with the perfect editing canvas to experiment with a plethora of tools, effects and filters to create exciting GIFs with basic and complex animation craft.</p>
<p>The software allows frame-by-frame animation that refers to working with different frames of a particular illustration, while making minimal changes in each frame. Once you finish, your final creation gets played in a motion loop.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-Animated-Gifs-in-Procreate"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-Animated-Gifs-in-Procreate" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate"></a>Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate</h2><p>As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select an Artwork</strong></p>
<p>Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.</p>
<p>If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.</p>

                      alt="Procreate Animated GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool</strong></p>
<p>From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Procreate- Animation Assist Tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.</p>
<p>While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.</strong></p>
<p>Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Almost There.</strong></p>
<p>You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.</p>
<p>To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Time to Share.</strong></p>
<p>Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.</p>
<p>You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.</p>
<p>Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.</p>

Be it for fun or a targeted market influence, you can depend on GIFs for a variety of information solutions. Moving to the creative aspect, the experimentation belt with creating GIFs is huge. From making simple static and animated GIFs to creating professionally sound market promotion tools; you can play with your editing skills to extract just anything from these quick snippets.</p>
<p>Having said that, let’s take a dive into creating animated <strong>Procreate GIFs</strong>. Being a relatively new dimension of GIF editing, a merge of the two produces matchless and classic results. Read through the further article to get a complete guide for working on GIF creation and editing with Procreate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Before you begin creating a <strong>Procreate GIF</strong>, let’s get a bit familiar with the concept behind this GIF creation utility. This one is an excellent and advanced means of exploring your skills in digital drawing and animations. It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.</p>
<p>Procreate allows you to work with animation in its ‘Animation Assist’ tool, where you get a generous workspace with the perfect editing canvas to experiment with a plethora of tools, effects and filters to create exciting GIFs with basic and complex animation craft.</p>
<p>The software allows frame-by-frame animation that refers to working with different frames of a particular illustration, while making minimal changes in each frame. Once you finish, your final creation gets played in a motion loop.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-Animated-Gifs-in-Procreate-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-Animated-Gifs-in-Procreate-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate"></a>Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate</h2><p>As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select an Artwork</strong></p>
<p>Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.</p>
<p>If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.</p>

                      alt="Procreate Animated GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool</strong></p>
<p>From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Procreate- Animation Assist Tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.</p>
<p>While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.</strong></p>
<p>Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Almost There.</strong></p>
<p>You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.</p>
<p>To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Time to Share.</strong></p>
<p>Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.</p>
<p>You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.</p>
<p>Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.</p>

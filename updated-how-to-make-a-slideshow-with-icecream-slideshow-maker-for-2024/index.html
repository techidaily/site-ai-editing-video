                      alt="Icecream Slideshow Maker"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Post a successful installation, proceed to launch the program and wait for the latter’s welcome screen to appear. In the launch screen, navigate to and tap any one of the ‘Add Photo’ or ‘Add Folder’ buttons at the top left corner to import either a single media file, or an entire media folder to the program’s editing workspace.</p>
<p>Instead of using the ‘Add Folder’ option at the top left, you can also select multiple files by pressing and holding the ‘Ctrl’ key son your system’s keyboard and import them to the editor timeline, all at once. You can alternatively, click on the ‘Add Files to Start Your Photostory’ tab in the center of the software’s welcome screen to import the required media files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-slideshow-with-icecream-slideshow-maker-2.JPG"
                      alt="Icecream Slideshow Maker- Media Selection Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Clicking on any of the aforesaid buttons or tabs will direct you to a ‘File Explorer’ window, where you can make the desired media selections. Your choices are however; filtered according to their respective file formats and only those in line with the formats supported by the Icecream Slideshow creator program are imported to the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Configure the Presentation Settings</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you finish the media import process, the editing workspace bifurcates to present the ‘Queue’ window at the left and ‘Preview and Settings’ window at the right side of the screen. This is the space where you can proceed to configure your presentation settings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>File Sorting</strong></p>
<p>To sort the arrangement of a media file, navigate to the ‘File Queue Panel’ at the left and click on the desired file, while using the ‘Arrow Keys’ at the right to change the latter’s position in the queue, or choose to delete it from the queue by tapping the ‘Recycle Bin’ icon beside the file.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Duration and Transition Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Proceeding further, you can try hands at customizing the duration and transition effects for each of the added media files within the queue. All you need to do is, navigate to and click on the respective tabs within the window. Hit the ‘Time’ button to adjust the screen time of the slides or click on the ‘Transitions’ tab to include suitable animation effects between successive slides for a smooth presentation flow.</p>
<p>You can even stick with a random transition effect to add to the slides, or choose to add no transition effect at all. The inbuilt slideshow player the right side of the editor workspace automatically plays the preview of the applied transition effects. The ‘Transition’ and ‘Time’ settings are the sole customizations that you can apply individually to the slides, the rest of the effects being universally applicable to all the presentation slides together.</p>
<p>If you are interested to apply a particular transition and play duration to all the slides, navigate to and click within the gray bar at the bottom of the file queue to apply the same transition and time characteristics to all the slides of the presentation. You can even opt to delete all the added media files at the same time by tapping the ‘Clear List’ button.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Tweak Some Extra Settings</strong></p>
<p>If you are keen towards making your presentation more impressive, try experimenting with including transition effects within the slides. Though the <strong>Icecream slideshow maker full version</strong> supports the application of default random transitions, you are allowed to add and customize the same as per your will, both, separately for each slide, as well as to the entre presentation as a whole.</p>
<p>You can even choose to add no transition effect at all, or set the same transition value for all the media files within the queue, by navigating to and clicking on the ‘Common Image Settings in the ’File Queue’ window.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7: Output Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Set a preferable output resolution to generate a premium quality slideshow presentation. To do this, navigate to the bottom left corner of the ‘Preview’ window at the right side of the editor workspace and choose a desired resolution for the slideshow from a range of values, such as, 1280 x 1024, 2560 x 1440, 1920 x 1080, etc., in the ‘Resolution’ tab.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> <strong>Format Selection</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is, select a convenient output file format for your presentation. You can pick anyone from the available AVI, WebM, MP4, MOV file formats. To make your choice, navigate to the bottom of the ‘File Queue’ window at the left and click on the ‘File Format’ dropdown arrow at the right. A list of the output formats supported by the program appears next, and you are free to pick the one you like.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Create Your Icecream Slideshow</strong></p>
<p>When you have finalized all the arrangements and settings, navigate to and hit the ‘Preview’ button at the bottom right corner of the ‘Preview’ window to initiate a mock run of your slideshow in the software’s inbuilt slideshow player. If everything seems fine, proceed to start the slideshow creation process by clicking on the ‘Create’ button.</p>

<p>The process may require you to wait for a few moments before the final presentation output is generated. Nonetheless, you can always keep a track of the creation process through the elapsed and remaining duration in the ‘Progress Bar’ at the bottom of the program’s editing workspace. A completion prompt will pop up as soon as the slideshow is ready.</p>

<p>And that’s what this article is about - How to use the various basic and advanced editing tools in Filmora to create a brand video that makes a difference!</p>
<p>But first, let’s have a look at…</p>
<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video"></a>Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video</h2><p>What’s so special about it, you ask?</p>
<p>For starters, it fits right into the criteria we mentioned above. It’s innovative, entertaining, vibrant, and fun and showcases all the features of Filmora 11.</p>

<p>From all the new effects to the AR sticker themes and other video editing features like speed ramping, masking, and green screen effect, the video successfully lets the audience know how creative they can get with Filmora.</p>
<p>But did you see that they didn’t put the features out there just like that! They actually used all the basic and advanced video editing features in the video to give us an idea of what it looks like when put in action.</p>
<p>And the video quality, the content, and the flow of the video speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I mean, I watched the video all the way to the end without getting bored for even a single second. And, being a video editor, I might as well get Filmora 11 after watching the highly compelling video!</p>
<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording"><a href="#3-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing"><a href="#5-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>
<h3 id="Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora at a Glance"></a>Wondershare Filmora at a Glance</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora has plenty of basic and advanced video editing features to add that wow factor to your video. It can turn a plain boring video into something fun, exciting, and watch-worthy.</p>
<p>For example, the motion tracking feature lets you add an object that follows a certain movement in the video. Then we have the AR stickers that help enhance emotions and add personality to your video. Also, the green screen feature lets you add amazing background to your video to give the desired effect.</p>
<p>Filmora also has many video effects, templates, speed ramping, masking, auto beat sync, voice recording, and other features that can really take your brand video to the next level.</p>
<p>I’m sure you now have the hang of how to make a brand video that makes your business pop. But, you still might be confused about how to make the most of these features using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some helpful tips on using these features to make an effective brand video that creates brand awareness and drives sales!</p>

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>

<p>And that’s what this article is about - How to use the various basic and advanced editing tools in Filmora to create a brand video that makes a difference!</p>

<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video"></a>Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video</h2><p>What’s so special about it, you ask?</p>

<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-1"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-1"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting-1"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording-1"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-1"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing-1"><a href="#5-Video-Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>
<h3 id="Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-1"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-1" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora at a Glance"></a>Wondershare Filmora at a Glance</h3><p><img

<p>Wondershare Filmora has plenty of basic and advanced video editing features to add that wow factor to your video. It can turn a plain boring video into something fun, exciting, and watch-worthy.</p>
<p>For example, the motion tracking feature lets you add an object that follows a certain movement in the video.

<p>Filmora also has many video effects, templates, speed ramping, masking, auto beat sync, voice recording, and other features that can really take your brand video to the next level.</p>
<p>I’m sure you now have the hang of how to make a brand video that makes your business pop. But, you still might be confused about how to make the most of these features using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some helpful tips on using these features to make an effective brand video that creates brand awareness and drives sales!</p>

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-1"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-1"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-1"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>

Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>

<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>

<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>

<p>And that’s what this article is about - How to use the various basic and advanced editing tools in Filmora to create a brand video that makes a difference!</p>
<p>But first, let’s have a look at…</p>
<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video"></a>Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video</h2><p>What’s so special about it, you ask?</p>

<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-2"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-2"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting-2"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording-2"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-2"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing-2"><a href="#5-Video-Editing-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>
<h3 id="Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora at a Glance"></a>Wondershare Filmora at a Glance</h3><p><img

And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-2"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-2"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-2"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-2"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-2"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-Up-2"><a href="#Wrapping-Up-2" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Shooting a brand video is easy, and it’s even easier to edit it. All you need is to let your creativity flow!</p>

<h2 id="Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora’s-Brand-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video"></a>Wondershare Filmora’s Brand Video</h2><p>What’s so special about it, you ask?</p>

<p>Now, if you’re also wow-ed by the video and would like to create a similar one, here are some tips on making a successful brand video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-3"><a href="#Tips-to-Make-a-Compelling-Brand-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video"></a>Tips to Make a Compelling Brand Video</h2><p>Like I said earlier, making a video is not simply about getting out your camera and starting recording. Many aspects need to be considered for your video to make the desired impact.</p>
<p>Therefore, here are some tips that might come in handy when making your brand video:</p>
<h3 id="1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-3"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Objective-and-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Objective and Audience"></a>1. Define Your Objective and Audience</h3><p>The very first thing that you need to think about before starting work on your brand video is its objective and audience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Define your Objective "
                ></p>
<p>What are you trying to achieve from the video? Do you want to create brand awareness, or do you wish to promote a certain product?</p>
<p>Secondly, who’s your target audience? Is your video projected toward people who have no idea who you and your company are? Or are you addressing an existing customer base? Also, are the audience kids or adults? Because you certainly can’t make a video with cartoon characters for an audience who’s looking for something calm and relaxing, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Once you have your objective and audience sorted, it’s time to get busy!</p>
<h3 id="2-Video-Scripting-3"><a href="#2-Video-Scripting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Video Scripting"></a>2. Video Scripting</h3><p>Based on what you’re trying to achieve from your brand video and the target audience, you can decide on the video’s script. This includes the content, the length, and the editing requirements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Video Scripting "
                ></p>
<p>Let’s take your video’s content, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re creating a video for an audience that doesn’t know you, you’ll have to start from the basics, explaining who you are, what you do, and the services you offer.</li>
<li>If you’re trying to create a video that tells your brand’s story, you can either keep it inspirational or you could create fun content that will be remembered for years to come!</li>
<li>If you’re creating something for the kids, you need to keep it short yet interesting, with many effects that help in grabbing their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have decided what to add to the video, how long it will be, and what its content will be like, you can finally record your video!</p>
<h3 id="3-Video-Recording-3"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording"></a>3. Video Recording</h3><p>Now, for many people, recording simply means hitting the record button.</p>
<p>Yes, that might work for vlogs, but when it comes to making a brand video, you need to really put in effort when recording.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Record your brand video "
                ></p>
<p>For instance, you should have all the video clips and images you want to include in the video at hand. And they should resonate with your brand voice and match with each other as well.</p>
<p>If we take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video as an example, you can see that the whole video has a vibrant and warm feel to it, which can be seen throughout. It’s not that one clip is darker and the other is lighter; the whole thing sort of blends into each other.</p>
<p>That’s what you should take care of when recording your video. Make sure the background, hues, and overall feel of the video clips and images match each other.</p>
<h3 id="4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-3"><a href="#4-Using-Your-Brand-Colors-and-Logo-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo"></a>4. Using Your Brand Colors and Logo</h3><p>Another thing that you should keep in mind when recording is to incorporate your brand colors in the video and throw in your logo. For instance, if your brand colors are red and green, make sure to use them in the text in the video. However, if you’re not using text, you can use the colors in the video frame by having a wall or something in the background of the same colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Use colors of your brand in your video "
                ></p>
<p>As for the logo, it can be placed anywhere in the video so that the audience learns to recognize it.</p>
<p>But why is using your brand colors and logo so important?</p>
<p>Because your brand colors and logo represent your brand and become its identity in the long run. For example, yellow and red are McDonald’s brand colors and its logo, the yellow ‘M’ in arch form, is recognizable even from a distance.</p>
<h3 id="5-Video-Editing-3"><a href="#5-Video-Editing-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Video Editing"></a>5. Video Editing</h3><p>Now comes the most important part of making a brand video: The editing! The part where you refine your video and add final touches to it. If you’ve got a stellar video editing software like Wondershare Filmora, it can do wonders for your video.</p>
<h3 id="Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-at-a-Glance-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora at a Glance"></a>Wondershare Filmora at a Glance</h3><p><img

<p>Filmora also has many video effects, templates, speed ramping, masking, auto beat sync, voice recording, and other features that can really take your brand video to the next level.</p>

<p>Therefore, here are some helpful tips on using these features to make an effective brand video that creates brand awareness and drives sales!</p>
<h2 id="Creative-Ideas-to-Make-Brand-Videos-Using-Filmora-3"><a href="#Creative-Ideas-to-Make-Brand-Videos-Using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Creative Ideas to Make Brand Videos Using Filmora"></a>Creative Ideas to Make Brand Videos Using Filmora</h2><p>If you’re up for making a video just like the video we shared earlier, you’ll need to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Wondershare Filmora from the website. And, once you’re through with this guide, nothing can stop you from making a brand video that sells!</p>
<p>With that sorted, here are some valuable tips and ideas to help you along the way:</p>
<h3 id="1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-3"><a href="#1-Level-Up-Your-Motion-Tracking-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking"></a>1. Level Up Your Motion Tracking</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, motion tracking means tracking the movement of an object in the video and then applying the same movement to a newly added object, like text, image, logo, or any clipart.</p>
<p>But that’s quite a common practice, right? I mean, every video editor out there is doing it!</p>
<p>However, there are some ways in which you can get creative with the motion tracking feature using Filmora.</p>
<p>Like…</p>
<p><strong>Using Motion-Tracked Texts</strong></p>
<p>While the text in a video looks pretty good itself, you can make it even more impressive by motion tracking it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach a piece of text to your introductory title. If there’s a logo or brand name in the introduction, you can add a tagline, a website address, or your Instagram or Twitter handle to it.</li>
<li>If you want to create a context for the audience, add motion-tracked captions in your brand video. This means the captions move with the movement of the subject. It looks stylish, gives relevant information, and helps tell your brand’s story without any narration.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Fitbit commercial would be an excellent example of motion-tracked captions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your video has an introductory scene where the frame is moving from one side to the other, you can motion-track the credits so that they move along with the scene and disappear gradually instead of dedicating a single clip to the credits.</li>
<li>Highlighting important aspects in a video, like places or names of objects with motion-tracked text, can make your video truly amazing and fun to watch. This would be quite essential if you’re making a video for the real estate or travel business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>Hence, when working with Filmora, you can do plenty with the motion tracking feature to make a truly amazing video.</p>
<h3 id="2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-3"><a href="#2-Add-a-Fun-Factor-with-AR-Stickers-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers"></a>2. Add a Fun Factor with AR Stickers</h3><p>Now that you know how to use the motion tracking feature in Filmora, let me tell you a secret!</p>
<p>If you incorporate face-tracking AR stickers into your video, you can succeed in creating a brand video that will have the audience glued to the screen!</p>
<p>The purpose of adding AR stickers to your videos is to emphasize reactions, portray enhanced emotions, and add an element of fun. This feature works best if you’re creating a brand video projected toward kids.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="AR sticker on face a girl using WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>So, how can you make the most of these AR stickers?</p>
<p><strong>Create Multiple Characters</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t have people to play different characters, don’t fret! With the AR sticker effect, you can create multiple characters for your video.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If your video has 3 animal characters, you can use AR stickers depicting a panda, cat, and bunny to show the different characters. Similarly, you can add the sticker with glasses to show a nerdy character. Or, if you’re really getting into the story-telling mode, you can use the pirate sticker to show a pirate.</p>
<p><strong>Magnify Emotions</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it gets challenging to portray a certain emotion in your video. This is where AR stickers come to the rescue!</p>
<p>If you want to show someone in love, you can use the heart-eyes effect. Or, if you want to show that someone is being good, you can use the angel sticker to put a halo on their head.</p>
<p>There are many options! You just have to use your creative cells and conjure up something that’s unique and stands out from the rest.</p>
<h3 id="3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3"><a href="#3-Ace-Your-Shoot-with-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect"></a>3. Ace Your Shoot with the Green Screen Effect</h3><p>A green-screen effect is quite important when it comes to making an exceptional brand video. It has been used in almost all blockbuster movies, and if you’re looking to make a video of a similar level, we’ve got some tried and tested tips to use the green screen effect to its fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Lighting is Even</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to a green screen, the lighting plays an important part. Make sure the green screen is one shade of green, and the lighting on the screen is even. If parts of the green screen are darker than the rest, the chroma key effect won’t be able to distinguish the different shades.</p>
<p><strong>Contrasting Colors</strong></p>
<p>Make sure the subject in the video isn’t wearing any green clothing, or there aren’t many green objects around, as they might disappear when you apply the green screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent Motion Blur with High Shutter Speed</strong></p>
<p>When shooting with a green screen background, make sure you keep the shutter speed high to avoid motion blur. Ideally, it should be 2x your frame rate for optimum results. But, at the same time, it shouldn’t be too high, as it can lead to a change in video exposure.</p>
<p>If you keep these tips in mind when shooting a video, you can easily use the chroma key effect in Wondershare Filmora to add your desired background and create an outstanding video.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-3"><a href="#4-Be-Innovative-with-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be Innovative with Effects"></a>4. Be Innovative with Effects</h3><p>A video without effects is as bland as water! So, make your video innovative with the impressive variety of effects available in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>But you can’t just add effects to your video like that! You need to understand when and where to use a certain effect properly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Your Story With Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>If you’re telling your brand story from the perspective of different individuals, using the split-screen effect is recommended. You can also use this effect to showcase how one thing is related to another in a cause-and-effect way.</p>
<p>Take this Lexus commercial, for example:</p>
<p>It shows the view from inside the car and from a viewer’s perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Emphasize with Pan and Zoom Effect</strong></p>
<p>As the topic of concern of this article is brand videos, the pan and zoom is an ideal effect for it.</p>
<p>You can easily emphasize its importance and give off an emotional storytelling vibe by zooming in on a person’s face or any other object in the frame. You can also use pan and zoom to add a transition to your video. Here’s an example:</p>
<p><strong>Add Thrill with Transitions</strong></p>
<p>To move from one shot to another, it’s important to add a transition effect in between. You can add different transition styles to link the shots with one another, for instance, the match cut transition to match scenes that are not otherwise linked visually. Or the whip pan transition, which involves a quick rotation of the camera’s axis to give the impression that the scene was shot in one take, although it is two separate clips.</p>
<p>Take Wondershare Filmora’s brand video, for example. You can see how seamlessly it moves from one effect to another. It adds value and makes the video fun to watch.</p>
<p>With the variety of transitions in Filmora’s library, you can add all the effects discussed above to your video for stunning results.</p>
<p>You’ve added motion tracking, used AR stickers, created a mystical background with the green screen effect, and gone innovative with effects. Now, it’s time to wrap up this article with…</p>
<h3 id="5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-3"><a href="#5-Energize-Your-Videos-with-Speed-Ramping-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping"></a>5. Energize Your Videos with Speed Ramping</h3><p>Did you know that speed ramping can actually improve your videos tenfold? Speeding up and slowing down the footage at certain points can have a significant impact. For example, the bullet dodge scene in “Matrix” wouldn’t have been so famous if it wasn’t for the slo-mo effect!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Speed Ramping in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>You can’t just randomly add speed ramps to your video. There has to be a purpose behind it! Do you want to emphasize something? Do you want to show a transition? Regardless, you need to time your speed ramping properly.</p>
<p>And here are a few tips for it!</p>
<p><strong>Use Slo-Mo For Action Sequences</strong></p>
<p>If your video has an amazing action scene in it, slow down the speed at that point to emphasize the action and movement. For example, a karate kick in slow motion very clearly shows us how the move is actually performed.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t Use Slo-Mo For Too Long</strong></p>
<p>Another tip is to use the slow-mo only for a few seconds to emphasize something. If you prolong it, it won’t have the desired impact and might even cause the audience to lose focus.</p>
<p><strong>Speed Up Footage for Long Processes</strong></p>
<p>If your video shows a long process, like a time-lapse, it is the perfect time to speed up the footage. Not only do long shots lose the viewer’s attention, but they can also get boring too. A sped up footage on the other hand makes your video aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Add Music</strong></p>
<p>Using music in videos is quite a common practice; however, it becomes quite exciting if you speed ramp your video according to the music. For example, time the slo-mo effect with the more silent or riverbed parts of the music, and speed it up when the crescendo comes.</p>
<p>You can do this easily with the auto beat-sync feature in Filmora that matches the music with the footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-create-a-brand-video-to-make-your-business-shine.png"
                      alt="Auto beat sync in WonderShare Filmora "
                ></p>
<p>How’s that for a thrilling video?</p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramp for Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a bonus tip! Use speed ramping at the end of one clip and the beginning of the next one to create a seamless flow between the two. It’ll also give a transition effect and make your brand video look professional.</p>
<p>So you see, you have ample options to add a touch of creativity to your brand videos. The key is to use a good video editor and the right video editing tools.</p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-Up-3"><a href="#Wrapping-Up-3" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping Up"></a>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Shooting a brand video is easy, and it’s even easier to edit it. All you need is to let your creativity flow!</p>

<p><strong>What are you planning to use it for?</strong>: You must know the use of video editing software before picking one. Whether you are using it for gaming or creating ordinary YouTube videos. These decisions are very important to take before opting for downloading it from the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: You should keep in mind which editing software is complex to learn and which one is easy in comparison with that. If you didn’t keep this in mind you might end up wasting your time by downloading and trying in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video.

<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>
<p>5. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning"><a href="#03Practical-Learning" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning"><a href="#04Combined-Learning" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable"><a href="#05Affordable" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>

The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AR-in-Teaching-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AR-in-Teaching-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?"></a>Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?</h2><p>For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-2"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-2" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-2"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-2"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-2"><a href="#05Affordable-2" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-2"><a href="#Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples"></a>Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples</h2><p>Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, <strong>AR classrooms</strong> have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-2"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-2" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AR-in-Teaching-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AR-in-Teaching-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?"></a>Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?</h2><p>For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-3"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-3"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-3" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-3"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-3" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-3"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-3" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-3"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-3" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-3"><a href="#05Affordable-3" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-3"><a href="#Part-3-10-Creative-AR-Teaching-Examples-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples"></a>Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples</h2><p>Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, <strong>AR classrooms</strong> have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-3"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-3" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

<h3 id="04Froggipedia-3"><a href="#04Froggipedia-3" class="headerlink" title="04Froggipedia"></a>04Froggipedia</h3><p>This is where things get interesting. Froggipedia is a great example of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong>. It’s basically a smartphone app that lets users explore the internal organs of a frog in a virtual environment. It means students would no longer have to get involved in the mess that dissecting an actual frog creates in the classroom and still get familiar with each organ easily.</p>

<h3 id="06Virtual-Classrooms-3"><a href="#06Virtual-Classrooms-3" class="headerlink" title="06Virtual Classrooms"></a>06Virtual Classrooms</h3><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of virtual classrooms as many schools still haven’t resumed physical classes to restrict the virus’s spread. In VR classrooms, mixed reality - a combination of VR and AR - can help students stay engaged, even if they are sitting apart from each other. Virtual Classrooms will eliminate boredom from remote learning and keep the engagement level high for students.</p>

<h3 id="07Secure-Training-3"><a href="#07Secure-Training-3" class="headerlink" title="07Secure Training"></a>07Secure Training</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, AR integration makes training more effective and risk-free. For example, with Microsoft Holo-lens, medical students understand the inner anatomy of the human body and understand complex procedures without having to risk a patient’s life. Once they are confident and know about each organ, they can move towards the next procedure and gain expertise in the particular domain more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="08Google-Expeditions-3"><a href="#08Google-Expeditions-3" class="headerlink" title="08Google Expeditions"></a>08Google Expeditions</h3><p>For a student, exploring the world is a great way to familiarize himself with different cultures. But, it’s not always possible for young kids to go on trips alone. Well, not anymore! Thanks to virtual tour platforms like Google Expeditions, teachers can take their students on virtual trips to different corners of the world, be it Mount Everest Base Camp or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</p>

<h3 id="09Augmented-Reality-in-Museums-3"><a href="#09Augmented-Reality-in-Museums-3" class="headerlink" title="09Augmented Reality in Museums"></a>09Augmented Reality in Museums</h3><p>The younger generation craves interactivity. They don’t have the time to read brochures in a Museum. That’s the reason why many Museums have started to launch AR-powered tech to keep the visitors engaged and let them learn various historical facts more precisely. For instance, in a nature-themed museum, visitors can experience digital animals and their position in history.</p>
<h3 id="10Virtual-Speech-3"><a href="#10Virtual-Speech-3" class="headerlink" title="10Virtual Speech"></a>10Virtual Speech</h3><p>Not particularly an Augmented Reality (AR) example, Virtual Speech is a combination of AR and VR that lets users virtually practice their public speaking skills without going on a real stage. This is a great tool to fight stage fear and speak with confidence in front of an actual crowd.</p>

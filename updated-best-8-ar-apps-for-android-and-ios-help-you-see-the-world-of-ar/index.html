<p>Suppose you want to buy a pair of eyeglasses and don’t know which pair would suit your look. Now you might wish to look at how your face would look on different frames. Here you can use AR and see which pair of glasses would fit you using AR. AR can be used to share and receive various kinds of tacit knowledge. Augmented Reality is often synonymously used for “Computed-mediated reality” and “Mixed- Reality.”</p>
<p>Despite such an exceptional concept, many users raised questions about the privacy issues of this app. AR technology constantly needs to record the real environment, which involves real human beings. Recording their movement breaches their privacy which can cause legal trouble for the user. If the videos are recorded with consent, they will not harm anyone.</p>

Suppose you want to buy an item of furniture and you do not know whether it would match your home décor; here, you can use AR to see whether the furniture would fit your décor or not.</p>

This process involves an experience where the real or physical world interweaves with virtually created objects. It interweaves so perfectly that the artificial seems a part of the natural. This is an artificial experience, and it adds to the real environment. AR gained popularity in the fields of entertainment and video games.</p>
<p>You might think that AR (Augmented Reality) is the same as VR (Virtual Reality). They are not the same.

<h2 id="How-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect?"></a>How to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect?</h2><p>No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.</p>
<p>All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="What Is Green Screen Technique?"></a>What Is Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.</p>
<p>Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Green Screen Technique?"></a>Why Use Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.</p>
<p>You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?"></a>How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?</h2><p>If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.</li>
<li>A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.</li>
<li>External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p>
<p>There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing.

Filmora has intuitive options and controls through which you can apply green screen effect in simple steps.</p>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p>
<p>There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing. The reason behind the recommendation is that the steps to replace the green screen with any image or video are super simple and anyone can do it.

Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections" class="headerlink" title="2. Break the image down into single-color sections"></a>2. Break the image down into single-color sections</h3><p>This is the part where “careful planning” comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building"><a href="#4-Start-building" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece’s complexity.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.</li>
<li>Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you’ll need to make your pixel art.</li>
<li>Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.</li>
<li>If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.</li>
</ul>

Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-2"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-2"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Break the image down into single-color sections"></a>2. Break the image down into single-color sections</h3><p>This is the part where “careful planning” comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-2"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building-2"><a href="#4-Start-building-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece.

<h3 id="3-Pixel-Art-Builder-3"><a href="#3-Pixel-Art-Builder-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Pixel Art Builder"></a>3. Pixel Art Builder</h3><p>In this mobile app, you can create Minecraft pixel art from the palm of your hand.</p>
<p>You can draw on grids rather than in real pixels to help you be more precise with your art. It has a very easy-to-use interface, and it is completely free.</p>
<p>Many of its key features are, for example, exporting images, dynamic size adjustment of the ability to save in several different formats. Its tools range from the regular pencil to eraser, paint bucket, line and circle drawer, move&#x2F;zoom function, color wheel, and eyedropper.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Pixel-Art-Minecraft-In-game-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Pixel-Art-Minecraft-In-game-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?"></a>Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?</h2><p>It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-3"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-3"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Break the image down into single-color sections"></a>2. Break the image down into single-color sections</h3><p>This is the part where “careful planning” comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-3"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building-3"><a href="#4-Start-building-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece’s complexity.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Creating-a-Wonderful-Minecraft-Pixel-Art-3"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Creating-a-Wonderful-Minecraft-Pixel-Art-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art"></a>Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art</h2><p>There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.</li>
<li>Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you’ll need to make your pixel art.</li>
<li>Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.</li>
<li>If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Conclusion-11"><a href="#Conclusion-11" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.</p>

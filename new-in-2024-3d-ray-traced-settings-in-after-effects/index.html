<p>In After Effects, it is a lightning technique for generating a photorealistic image by tracing the light’s path through a scene in three dimensions. Raytracing lets you have proper reflections, internal refraction, and transparency.</p>
<p>In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the basics of Ray Tracing and everything you need to know about 3D <strong>Ray Traced</strong> in After Effects.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p>
<p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p>
<p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p>

<h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p>
<p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-aliasing And Depth Of Field:</strong> Ray Tracing can help you quickly get the anti-aliasing and depth of field effects.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Disadvantages"><a href="#Disadvantages" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages"></a>Disadvantages</h3><p>The downside of Ray Tracing technology is that it requires a lot of computing power to run, and it can be difficult to create more complex lighting effects like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-174FC56F-A781-4D0A-98D7-790D436E98AE-htm.html#:~:text=Caustics%20are%20the%20effects%20of,or%20refraction%20through%20another%20object.&text=To%20calculate%20caustics%2C%20the%20mental,by%20the%20default%20scanline%20renderer.%29" >caustics. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

How Does Ray Tracing Work?</h2><p>Ray Tracking uses the process of denoising. The algorithm starts with the camera and traces the shades of shadows and lights.</p>
<p>Ray Tracing uses machine learning to fill in the gaps to form a realistic image. The brighter the scene, the higher the graphics quality; the higher the quality, the more expensive it is. This is why Ray Tracing didn’t become popular in the video game industry until recently.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects"></a>Part 4. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects</h2><p>After the introduction of Ray Tracing, we will combine it with a popular video editor - Adobe After Effects to see how it works. Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool for creating visual effects and animated graphics. Adobe introduced Ray Tracing or <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> feature in After Effect to help graphic designers create photorealistic 3D images and render light and shadow. This feature was added in 2012 with the release of After Effects CS 6.</p>

                      alt="ray tracing in adobe after effects"
                ></p>
<p>However, the Ray Tracing feature was later removed from After Effects in 2020 due to multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ray Tracing tool always faced bugs and glitches.</li>
<li>This feature did not work correctly if you were not using Adobe Media Encoder.</li>
<li>NVIDIA would change the standards from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" class="headerlink" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h3><p>Though as mentioned above, the Ray Tracing feature was removed in 2020, its advanced 3D features are still worth of introducing. Here’re some functions of <strong>Ray Traced 3D After Effects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ray Traced allows you to generate and place multiple lights.</li>
<li>You can set a material option for 3D layers.</li>
<li>Moreover, you can control how shadows are cast.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does It Work"></a>How Does It Work</h3><p>3D Ray Tracing in After Effects works by giving your text and paths more depth. Extruded layers have a z-axis depth, making them three-dimensional. This extra dimension is viewable from all angles, even when the layer is rotated. In contrast, non-extruded layers have zero depth on the z-axis. So, they will disappear if you try to rotate them 90 degrees on the x or y-axis.</p>

Ray-Traced 3D Settings In Adobe After Effects</h2><p>The release of the <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> setting in After Effects CS6 made it easier than ever to create stunning 3D images and animations. Let’s focus on how to use it in After Effects appropriately.</p>
<h3 id="How-To-Set-It"><a href="#How-To-Set-It" class="headerlink" title="How To Set It"></a>How To Set It</h3><p>Adobe After Effects has a three-dimensional space animation setting, but this doesn’t include Ray Tracing. You need to change the default settings if you want to use it in your animation. To do so:</p>
<p>Step1 Go to the <strong>Composition Settings</strong> panel to set up the <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> composition.</p>
<p>Step2 Open the <strong>Advanced tab,</strong> and from the <strong>“Renderer”</strong> option, select <strong>“Ray-Traced 3D”</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p>

                      alt="setting ray traced 3d in after effects"
                ></p>
<p>A layer becomes a 3D layer when the 3D checkbox is checked in the timeline and has more options than a normal layer regarding composition. When you open the layer properties timeline, you can access two options: Geometry Options and Material Options.</p>
<p>The former deals with the layer’s depth and edges shape, while the latter deals with the interaction of layers with depth and includes shadow, reflection, refraction, and transparency option.</p>

What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p>
<p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p>
<p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p>

<p><strong>How to capture the best footage?</strong></p>
<p>You can shoot handheld with a camera or a mobile phone because it allows you to move around your talent and catch some movements and action while giving a shaky camera effect for added suspense. To make evenly balanced videos, you can use a gimbal stabilizer. Here are some tips to get better shots.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change camera angles. Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.</li>
<li>Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.</li>
<li>Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.</li>
<li>Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage. Finally, we will dive into edit tutorials on speed ramping and glitch effects separately for better understanding.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora"><a href="#Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora"></a>Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora</h5><p>There are two ways to achieve the speed ramping effect. One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.</p>
<p><strong>Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let’s start by opening Filmora.</p>
<p>1. Import media</p>
<p>First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg"
                      alt="library in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>2. Apply the speed ramping feature</p>
<p>To apply the speed ramping feature, <strong>right-click</strong> on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose <strong>speed ramping</strong> to open the settings window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-4.jpg"
                      alt="add speed ramping option"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-5.jpg"
                      alt="speed templates on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.</p>
<p>After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.</p>
<p><strong>Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.</p>
<p>1. You can <strong>drag</strong> the video from your library to the timeline. While in the <strong>timeline</strong>, double-click to open the speed menu. Then choose the starting speed you want your video to be with the speed slider.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="uniform speed"
                ></p>
<p>2. Next, move your playhead to the <strong>point of the video</strong> you want to slow down the speed. Here we will cut and then double-click that clip to open the speed menu again. Change the pace with the speed slider again</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split adjusting the clips"
                ></p>
<p>Following the above steps, a speed ramping style effect can be created without using the premium feature. Stealthy, isn’t it?</p>

It is a plug-in built-in Filmora and gives a feeling of chaos to match the action in the video. To apply the BCC glitch effect to the video.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the effects options in the top bar. For example, a window on the left side showing you the option Boris FX will have a sub-option BCC stylize. Click on it.</li>
<li>Drag the effect above the place you want it in the timeline.</li>
<li>Double-click the effect to open its settings.</li>
<li>A drop-down menu at the top of the screen has tons of glitch presets to try out.</li>
<li>We are going to scroll down and select shake with motion blur. This preset will use the exact look we want for our basketball video to make the speed ramping more intense.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can change the settings around after choosing a preset. For example, let’s turn up the glitch intensity to have our glitch a little more extreme. Moving further, we can change the glitch duration to our specific needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can watch our video to see our glitch with the motion blur effect. Isn’t it crazy to make a cinematic video by yourself? The speed ramping feature and glitch effects can bring any sports video to the next level.</p>

There are millions of videos uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, and other video-sharing sites each day. Sharing your videos with others is possible when you know how to resize them in VLC. VLC is a free media player that allows you to convert or compress your videos in order to make them smaller for uploading or downloading.</p>
<p>Videos are a great way to showcase your business, company, or product on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But what happens when you use the wrong size for your video? The whole thing looks distorted and low quality. It’s not very appealing.</p>
<p>Luckily, resizing videos in VLC is simple. All you need is the right software and the right steps.</p>
<p>This blog post will walk you through how to resize videos using VLC. We’ll cover what the default settings are for video resolutions, how to change them, and why it’s important to know what size of video you’re uploading before uploading it.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Step-by-step-to-resize-your-video-in-VLC"><a href="#Step-by-step-to-resize-your-video-in-VLC" class="headerlink" title="Step by step to resize your video in VLC"></a>Step by step to resize your video in VLC</h2><p>Anyone who has a lot of videos on their computer knows how frustrating it can be to find the video you want among the hundreds of ones you have. Well, VLC makes it possible to resize your videos so they’ll fit onto your desktop. Here’s how:</p>

To lower the video size, you’ll be pleased to learn that VLC allows you to convert video&#x2F;audio files without the need to install any other software. The video conversion guide for VLC can be found below.</p>

<p>VLC Media Player is unquestionably one of the greatest video players available for free. Nonetheless, it isn’t the finest video reduction because it just reduces the size of videos by using certain simple parameters rather than complex ones. As a result, we offer Fimora, an all-in-one video toolbox that can convert, compress, download, record, edit, burn, and more, as a better video compressor. You can change the video resolution, bit rate, encoder, format, and other settings to compress video and audio files in a variety of formats. Follow the simple steps below to get this VLC compressor replacement on your Windows&#x2F;Mac for free.</p>

To resize videos, first make sure you have imported your video file into the editor.</p>
<p><strong>Resizing by changing the dimensions</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop the file on the screen or click on “Import Files” in the toolbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-7.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Once you’ve imported your video, select the video clips that you want to resize by clicking on them; then, resizing them is as simple as dragging their borders!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-8.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: You can also use the size fields at the bottom of the frame to change their dimensions.</p>
<p>Step 4: Keep in mind that changing one dimension of a video clip will affect both its width and height proportionally. For example, if you enlarge a 16:9 widescreen clip to 720p (from 480p), it will be double its original proportions (720x480).</p>
<p><strong>Resizing by shrinking video file size.</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop it onto the screen or use the toolbar’s “Import Files” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Open the video shrinker’s output window by clicking the “Export” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Format tab and keep the video in its original format as a result. Then, in the “Settings” panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by choosing a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. When it comes to video formats, you can choose among FLV, MP4, and other similar formats, which normally result in smaller files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-11.png"
                      alt="resize-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: The shrunk file should be exported.</p>

<h3 id="Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version"><a href="#Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version"></a>Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version</h3><p>The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>
<h3 id="Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not"><a href="#Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not"></a>Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not</h3><p>Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>

<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

<h3 id="Unique-and-Distinct-Features-of-Filmora-3"><a href="#Unique-and-Distinct-Features-of-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Unique and Distinct Features of Filmora"></a>Unique and Distinct Features of Filmora</h3><p>Software is not nearly as good if it does not have the appropriate set of functionalities, and most users will not bother to use it if it does not include these features. Listed here are the most eagerly anticipated features of Filmora’s latest version:</p>
<h4 id="Motion-Tracking-3"><a href="#Motion-Tracking-3" class="headerlink" title="Motion Tracking"></a>Motion Tracking</h4><p>The Motion Tracking module enables you to identify an object or point inside a video and then have the computer track that object or point to generate a moving path.</p>
<p>It allows you to capture the motion of a moving object in the frame and add text, subtitles, effects, and other components to the frame that follow the moving object’s motion as it moves around the screen. After you’ve constructed that path, you may link any other item to it and have it follow the initial object.</p>
<h4 id="Colour-Matching-Feature-3"><a href="#Colour-Matching-Feature-3" class="headerlink" title="Colour Matching Feature"></a>Colour Matching Feature</h4><p>This team has always considered that Filmora’s colour grading and correction tools were excellent, but their most recent addition to the ‘Color Matching’ program has garnered them even more praise.</p>
<p>Colour matching is crucial when trying to merge several video images obtained by two different cameras. In this semi-automated module, you may match video from multiple sources or footage acquired at different times of day with one another.</p>
<h4 id="Keyframing-Feature-3"><a href="#Keyframing-Feature-3" class="headerlink" title="Keyframing Feature"></a>Keyframing Feature</h4><p>Keyframing is an essential feature for users who wish to boost the appeal of their video by incorporating critical animation sequences throughout the film.</p>
<p>It enables you to create custom animations and have fine-grained control over the effects you apply to your projects via the use of keyframes.</p>
<p>Keyframing becomes critical when creating special effects, custom title cards at the beginning or middle of a film or conjuring precise paths for visuals or picture-in-picture movies to follow.</p>
<h4 id="Audio-Ducking-3"><a href="#Audio-Ducking-3" class="headerlink" title="Audio Ducking"></a>Audio Ducking</h4><p>Audio ducking is a method used in video editing and production that allows the narrator’s voice to be heard consistently and clearly over other sounds on the recording that are happening at the same time, such as background music, without being dominated.</p>
<h4 id="Transitions-and-Vast-Amount-of-Effects-3"><a href="#Transitions-and-Vast-Amount-of-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Transitions and Vast Amount of Effects"></a>Transitions and Vast Amount of Effects</h4><p>Over 300 special effects, objects, overlays, transitions, and music and audio effects are available whenever and wherever you need them. The bundle includes 25 sound effects and 26 royalty-free recordings, making it a complete package.</p>
<p>Then there are 176 transitions, each of which may be customized to liven up your project. You may also alter and manipulate visuals and text to make your project more aesthetically appealing.</p>
<h4 id="Hardcore-Video-Editing-3"><a href="#Hardcore-Video-Editing-3" class="headerlink" title="Hardcore Video Editing"></a>Hardcore Video Editing</h4><p>Moving on to the heart of this application, Filmora latest version’s video editing features are both excellent and user-friendly.

<h4 id="Simplified-Exporting-Of-Your-Masterpiece-3"><a href="#Simplified-Exporting-Of-Your-Masterpiece-3" class="headerlink" title="Simplified Exporting Of Your Masterpiece"></a>Simplified Exporting Of Your Masterpiece</h4><p>Exporting a finished project is as simple as any other activity in Filmora latest version. Indeed, the option to export your completed project is clearly presented on the main page and instantly visible to the human eye. After you’ve completed making changes, all you have to do is click the ‘Export’ button.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-change-video-playback-speed-in-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-change-video-playback-speed-in-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to change video playback speed in Filmora"></a>How to change video playback speed in Filmora</h3><p>When using fast-motion&#x2F;slow-motion effects on a video, the clips are sped up or slowed down in comparison to their original speed.</p>

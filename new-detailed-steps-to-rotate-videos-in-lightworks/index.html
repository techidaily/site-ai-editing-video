<h2 id="Step-by-step-on-how-to-rotate-videos-in-Lightworks"><a href="#Step-by-step-on-how-to-rotate-videos-in-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="Step-by-step on how to rotate videos in Lightworks"></a>Step-by-step on how to rotate videos in Lightworks</h2><p>How to Manually Rotate a Video in Lightworks</p>
<p>To manually rotate a video in Lightworks, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Import your video into the project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-lightworks-1.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Choose the portion of the video you want to rotate; if you want to rotate the entire movie, simply choose the entire video instead of a specific portion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-lightworks-2.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Click on the “VFX” tab and go to the “3D DVE” section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-lightworks-3.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Choose the Z axis and rotate the video to the desired degree. You can also modify the orientation of the video by entering a value in the box provided in front of the Z-axis.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-lightworks-4.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Click on the Enter in the keyboard button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-lightworks-5.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Your video will now be rotated by the selected number of degrees.</p>

A good intro is a doorbell to let people know you’ve arrived.</p>
<p>A strong introduction ensures that more people will view your film. Adults have an attention span of about 12 seconds, according to studies from 2000. It is now only 8 seconds. You have 8 seconds to entice viewers to watch your video, so don’t waste it. A captivating introduction will give your content a professional touch and pique your audience’s interest. This task is worthwhile if you want to advertise your videos successfully.</p>
<p>These days, you don’t necessarily need to hire a pro to make a film if you need one. The majority of the available tools are free. We’ll demonstrate in this lesson how to use Renderforest to create a polished video intro. Our intro maker will let you start strong, whether for a fun birthday video or commercial use.</p>
<p>When you’re prepared to begin producing your videos, go to Renderforest, register for an account, or sign in if you already have one.</p>
<p>Check out the vast selection of templates under “<strong>Intros and logos</strong>“ in the “<strong>Create Video</strong>“ section of the navigation menu.

<h2 id="Competition-to-Renderforest"><a href="#Competition-to-Renderforest" class="headerlink" title="Competition to Renderforest"></a>Competition to Renderforest</h2><p>Animoto and PowToon are a couple of the site’s main rivals. These are excellent online video editing tools, but Renderforest stands out because it is simple to use and enables even novice users to create, share quickly, and download “broadcast grade videos.”</p>
<p><strong>Renderforest vs PowToon</strong></p>
<p>One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It’s challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.</p>
<p>PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn’t provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.</p>
<p>PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.</p>
<p>Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.</p>
<p>Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.</p>
<p>Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.</p>

<p>Speed ramping is a popular Premiere Pro effect for good reason: it looks fantastic! When utilized simultaneously to spice up a video clip, slow motion and quick motion may both be great aesthetic choices. This practice may save you time by enabling you to show more about what you want to see in your edit without using harsh jump cuts.</p>

<p>This effect may be used for a number of reasons, including clip transitions, speeding up a clip to make it shorter, and slowing down a clip to make it longer. Speed ramping may be used with a number of various effects.</p>
<p>According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The ability to alter the speed of individual clips is one of Premiere Pro’s most important capabilities. While speed ramping is often used in sports highlights, changing the speed of video may be useful for a number of other types of material.</p>
<p>You’ll learn how to construct a spectacular speed ramp in Adobe Premiere Pro, beginning with capturing the proper kind of video and moving to advanced tips and methods. Following that, we’ll go through some ideas and inspiration for when to use a speed ramp in your circumstance.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#What-is-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="What is Speed Ramping?"></a>What is Speed Ramping?</h2><p>A speed ramp is used to gradually increase the speed of a video clip as it accelerates or decelerates. It is guaranteed that a smooth transition between two separate speeds will take place. The method is crucial in changing the tempo of the film and, as a consequence, creating a dramatic impression. The film’s required velocity is achieved by the employment of super-fast visual effects.</p>
<p>A speed ramp, as opposed to a rapid shift in speed, provides for a more smooth transition between two drastically differing speeds. This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.</p>
<h3 id="Examples-of-Speed-Ramping"><a href="#Examples-of-Speed-Ramping" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Speed Ramping"></a>Examples of Speed Ramping</h3><p>It works especially well when utilized to focus the viewer’s attention on a certain moment or action in your videos, such as a tough jump or an impending bullet. Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.</p>
<p>You may also use Speed Ramping to alter the runtime of your video to fit the time limits of other social media sites, such as Instagram and Vine. If you just have 30 seconds to deliver your video, the following are the two most common places where people apply speed ramping techniques:</p>
<p>Assume you are shooting a person walking and want the clip to play in slow motion so that viewers can clearly see the person’s face. In this scenario, speed ramping is precisely what you need since it enables you to do precisely that.</p>
<p>Do you remember the famous movie “The Matrix” scene, when Neo dodges the bullets? It’s not some typical scene; it’s a pretty good example of speed ramping.</p>

<p>While using Premiere Pro, the ability to change a clip’s speed without altering its pitch is a very useful feature. An example of how this feature comes in helpful is when you have a clip that shows someone or something moving from left to right or vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="Advanced-Premiere-Pro-Time-Remapping"><a href="#Advanced-Premiere-Pro-Time-Remapping" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Premiere Pro Time Remapping"></a>Advanced Premiere Pro Time Remapping</h3><p>The fact that this effect is so simple to use is its main benefit.

<p>If you want to go deep into the game, Speed Ramp offers some more advanced options that give you even more control over your speed modifications. The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth"><a href="#Techniques-to-Make-Speed-Ramping-Smooth" class="headerlink" title="Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth"></a>Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth</h2><p>In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-1"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-1" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-1"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-2"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-2" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-2"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-2" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

<li><strong>High Frame Rate:</strong> The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it’s been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.</li>
<li><strong>Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:</strong> Another possibility is to modify your video’s frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip’s properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip’s parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.</li>
<li><strong>Purposeful</strong> <strong>Time Remapping:</strong> Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.</li>

<p>This effect may be used for a number of reasons, including clip transitions, speeding up a clip to make it shorter, and slowing down a clip to make it longer. Speed ramping may be used with a number of various effects.</p>
<p>According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The ability to alter the speed of individual clips is one of Premiere Pro’s most important capabilities. While speed ramping is often used in sports highlights, changing the speed of video may be useful for a number of other types of material.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-Speed-Ramping-3"><a href="#What-is-Speed-Ramping-3" class="headerlink" title="What is Speed Ramping?"></a>What is Speed Ramping?</h2><p>A speed ramp is used to gradually increase the speed of a video clip as it accelerates or decelerates. It is guaranteed that a smooth transition between two separate speeds will take place. The method is crucial in changing the tempo of the film and, as a consequence, creating a dramatic impression. The film’s required velocity is achieved by the employment of super-fast visual effects.</p>
<p>A speed ramp, as opposed to a rapid shift in speed, provides for a more smooth transition between two drastically differing speeds.

<p>If you want to go deep into the game, Speed Ramp offers some more advanced options that give you even more control over your speed modifications. The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Steps-To-Use-Speed-Ramping-In-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro"></a>Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro</h3><p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.</li>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.</li>
<li>Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.</li>
<li>To create a sequence if you don’t already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip’s parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.</li>
<li>Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with “Command+K,” or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the “Command+K” shortcut).</li>
<li>Keyframes will be created at this point. It’s first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting “Show Clip Keyframes” from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.</li>
<li>Another drop-down option will appear, from which you’ll choose “Time Remapping” and then press the “Enter” key.</li>
<li>Select “Speed” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the “P” key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you’ll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.</li>
<li>If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.</li>
<li>Switch back to the selection tool when you’ve finished placing your keyframes. “V” is the shortcut key for this.</li>
<li>Now comes the critical moment: it’s time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.</li>
<li>It’s not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.</li>
<li>Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Keyframe-Interpolation-3"><a href="#Keyframe-Interpolation-3" class="headerlink" title="Keyframe Interpolation"></a>Keyframe Interpolation</h3><p>When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.</p>
<p>In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.</li>
<li>Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.</li>
<li>To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Speed-Ramp-Transition-3"><a href="#Speed-Ramp-Transition-3" class="headerlink" title="Speed Ramp Transition"></a>Speed Ramp Transition</h3><p>Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character’s perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.</li>
<li>Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.</p>

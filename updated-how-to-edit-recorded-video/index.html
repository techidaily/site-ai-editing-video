            <h2 id="How-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#How-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit Recorded Video"></a>How to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg"
                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                      alt="obs customize the recording source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select an Artwork</strong></p>
<p>Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.</p>
<p>If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.</p>

                      alt="Procreate Animated GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool</strong></p>
<p>From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Procreate- Animation Assist Tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.</p>
<p>While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.</strong></p>
<p>Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Almost There.</strong></p>
<p>You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.</p>
<p>To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Time to Share.</strong></p>
<p>Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.</p>
<p>You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.</p>
<p>Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.</p>

This one is an excellent and advanced means of exploring your skills in digital drawing and animations. It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.</p>
<p>Procreate allows you to work with animation in its ‘Animation Assist’ tool, where you get a generous workspace with the perfect editing canvas to experiment with a plethora of tools, effects and filters to create exciting GIFs with basic and complex animation craft.</p>
<p>The software allows frame-by-frame animation that refers to working with different frames of a particular illustration, while making minimal changes in each frame. Once you finish, your final creation gets played in a motion loop.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-Animated-Gifs-in-Procreate-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-Animated-Gifs-in-Procreate-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate"></a>Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate</h2><p>As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Select an Artwork</strong></p>
<p>Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.</p>
<p>If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.</p>

                      alt="Procreate Animated GIF Creator"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool</strong></p>
<p>From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.</p>

                      alt="Procreate- Animation Assist Tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.</p>
<p>While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.</strong></p>
<p>Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Almost There.</strong></p>
<p>You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.</p>
<p>To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6: Time to Share.</strong></p>
<p>Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.</p>
<p>You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.</p>
<p>Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.</p>

<p>Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is free and open-source software that allows users to record videos and live stream events right at their comfort. The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.</p>
<p>Since its initial launch in 2012, OBS has made tremendous moves – This is not only from the constant release of its new versions but also the relentless increase in the functionality features. Besides, OBS is equipped with a robust API that enables plugins and scripts which provide extensive customization to precisely suit one’s needs.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-2"><a href="#How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply Color Correction in OBS"></a>How to Apply Color Correction in OBS</h2><p>When you carry out basic edits to your videos or images with OBS and realize that your project has poor shade, color, or tone, you don’t have to export it to another software to correct it. Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.</p>
<p>Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.</p>
<p>There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Gamma-2"><a href="#1-Gamma-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Gamma"></a>1. Gamma</h4><p>Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast.

<p>High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="2-Contrast-2"><a href="#2-Contrast-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrast"></a>2. Contrast</h4><p>Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.</p>
<p>“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.</p>
<h4 id="3-Brightness-2"><a href="#3-Brightness-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Brightness"></a>3. Brightness</h4><p>Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.</p>
<p>High brightness in OBS is denounced by the letter “L,” whereas Low brightness is denounced by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="4-Saturation-2"><a href="#4-Saturation-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Saturation"></a>4. Saturation</h4><p>Saturation is the intensity of colors in a video or an image.

<h2 id="How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-3"><a href="#How-to-Apply-Color-Correction-in-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Apply Color Correction in OBS"></a>How to Apply Color Correction in OBS</h2><p>When you carry out basic edits to your videos or images with OBS and realize that your project has poor shade, color, or tone, you don’t have to export it to another software to correct it. Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.</p>
<p>Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.</p>
<p>There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Gamma-3"><a href="#1-Gamma-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Gamma"></a>1. Gamma</h4><p>Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast. To be precise, Gamma works almost similarly to change in brightness while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the contrast.</p>
<p>In editing, Gamma is applicable mainly for removing shiny foreheads and webcam footage in gaming and browsing.</p>
<p>High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="2-Contrast-3"><a href="#2-Contrast-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Contrast"></a>2. Contrast</h4><p>Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.</p>
<p>“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.</p>
<h4 id="3-Brightness-3"><a href="#3-Brightness-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Brightness"></a>3. Brightness</h4><p>Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.</p>
<p>High brightness in OBS is denounced by the letter “L,” whereas Low brightness is denounced by “R.”</p>
<h4 id="4-Saturation-3"><a href="#4-Saturation-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Saturation"></a>4. Saturation</h4><p>Saturation is the intensity of colors in a video or an image. High saturated images are bright, strong, and are rich, whereas the low saturated photos appear washed out. Black and white (grayscale) photos have no color saturation. In OBS, high saturation and low saturation are represented as “L” and “R.”</p>
<h4 id="5-Hue-Shift-3"><a href="#5-Hue-Shift-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Hue Shift"></a>5. Hue Shift</h4><p>Hue shift is the change in an image’s saturation, lightness, and hue colors. Hue shifting occurs when highlighting or shading images. In OBS, you can use the hue shift functionality to reimage your image with a completely different color palette.</p>
<p>With the hue shift functionality in OBS, you can place the image on top of another and have an 80% opacity. It means that you will still see the first image when you place the second one on top of it.</p>
<p>The “L” sign in the OBS hue shift represents 50% opacity, while the “R” represents 100% Opacity.</p>
<h2 id="Color-Grade-in-OBS-3"><a href="#Color-Grade-in-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Color Grade in OBS"></a>Color Grade in OBS</h2><p>Color grading is the process of enhancing the appearance of an image through attributes such as contrast, saturation, and color, making them enchanting for presentations. Color grading is not only done for still images but also for motion pictures and images.</p>
<p>Color grading functionality in OBS is encompassed with several tools – This includes:</p>
<h4 id="1-Lift-tool-3"><a href="#1-Lift-tool-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Lift tool"></a>1. Lift tool</h4><p>As the name suggests, lift tools are used in lifting or removing specific colors from an image. It does so without necessarily affecting other colors in an image.</p>
<p>With this tool, you can selectively remove unwanted colors from your image or video, replace them with your desired ones, and create astonishing results.</p>
<h4 id="2-Offset-3"><a href="#2-Offset-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Offset"></a>2. Offset</h4><p>Offset is another outstanding tool in OBS color grading that controls the blacks&#x2F;Shadows of an image. It functions by altering the brightness levels and leaving the highlights and the mid-tones unaffected.</p>
<h4 id="3-Gain-3"><a href="#3-Gain-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Gain"></a>3. Gain</h4><p>A gain is a tool in OBS color correction that functions by only adjusting the white levels in an image. With the gain tool, brighter colors become brighter or darker.</p>
<p>Many people, especially beginner editors, experience difficulty differentiating between the Gamma and Offset tools. Yes, there is a closer similarity between the two, and for you to be on the safe side, you need to know that Gamma goes with the mid-tones (middle gray levels) whereas the Gain goes with highlights&#x2F;whites.</p>

It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand’s success and prosperity!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-When-Should-You-Use-the-PNG-or-Vector-Format"><a href="#Part-2-When-Should-You-Use-the-PNG-or-Vector-Format" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?"></a>Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?</h2><p>What’s the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it’d look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo’s background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background’s color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.</p>
<p>Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-Format-and-Where-to-Use-a-Transparent-Logo-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-Format-and-Where-to-Use-a-Transparent-Logo-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo"></a>Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo</h2><p>A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand’s success and prosperity!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-When-Should-You-Use-the-PNG-or-Vector-Format-3"><a href="#Part-2-When-Should-You-Use-the-PNG-or-Vector-Format-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?"></a>Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?</h2><p>What’s the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it’d look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo’s background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background’s color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.</p>
<p>Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>

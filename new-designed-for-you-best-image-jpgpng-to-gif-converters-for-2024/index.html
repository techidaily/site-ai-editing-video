<h2 id="Introduction-2"><a href="#Introduction-2" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>GIF images have become a viral trend due to the high level of social media usage. Often, people like to share GIF images on social media websites to impress their family and friends or catch fun. One reason for the popularity of GIF images is that these images play like videos but without any voice and usually occupy less space compared to larger video files.</p>
<p>In addition, the format of this image uses lossless compression, which allows images to be saved multiple times without compromising the quality or originality. Therefore, if you have a lot of JPEG or PNG images and are looking for a way to combine them into a GIF format, you can do it very quickly as there are many professional tools available on the internet. This article will guide you on various methods to convert PNG or <strong>JPG into GIF</strong> and list the several PNG or <strong>JPG to GIF converters</strong> online and on desktop software.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of loop TikTok videos</strong></p>
<p>TikTok loop includes the use of videos with a similar rhythm to create a special atmosphere that attracts people to participate and share them. The videos are made by those people who know how to make the video attractive to the public. The most used technique of communication is through a video that is shared on social networks like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>One reason why loop TikTok videos are so popular is that they’re really easy to use. You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to create them. All you need is a smartphone. Also, loop TikTok videos are a great way to share a moment with your friends and followers. Plus, they can be posted on the go and shared instantly.</p>
<p>Looping TikTok videos can have several positive impacts on your brand. Looping allows you to build a more consistent look for your content if you want to keep building brand equity. Second, it helps you maintain consistency in your storytelling across platforms. Third, it helps you avoid having to spend time creating new content because it gives viewers what they expect from you.</p>
<p>TikTok is one of the fastest-growing mobile apps in the world. It allows you to make short videos, which can be edited and shared with friends. As a plus, you can add cool music to your videos and customize them the way you want. You can also create short videos of yourself lip-syncing to the music. This article will guide you about the loop TikTok video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-a-Computer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-a-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on a Computer"></a>Part 2: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on a Computer</h2><p>Time-lapse video is a type of video that allows you to see a huge amount of change in a very short time. You can see it on all social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. It can be used to make all kinds of videos, from simple scenes of nature to complex events. The first time-lapse video was made in France in 1872 by Léon Bouly.</p>
<p>There are a lot of steps to make a time-lapse video on a computer.</p>
<p>Step1 You need to download the free software that comes with the camera. You can find it on the manufacturer’s website or through a search engine.</p>
<p>Step2 You’ll want to plug in your phone’s charging cable and plug it in so that it can stay charged while filming.</p>
<p>Step3 You’ll need to find somewhere quiet where you can set up your camera and tripod. If possible, try to do this outside so that there’s no worry about getting dust or dirt on your lens.</p>
<p>Step4 Set up your phone so that it will record once every hour for an hour straight. This will give you enough time for each frame of video before switching over to the next one after an hour has passed.</p>
<p>Step5 Start recording!</p>
<p><strong>Why we should make a time-lapse video on a computer?</strong></p>
<p>Time lapses are also useful for showing how something changes over time. For example, if you want to show how an environment changes from day to night, or how a plant grows from seedlings into mature plants after being watered and nourished by sunlight, these videos would be perfect for demonstrating this change in real-time.</p>
<p>You can also create time-lapse videos that show the growth of plants or flowers over time. You could use this method to demonstrate how plants grow from seedlings into fully grown trees or bushes. You could even try creating a time-lapse video showing the growth of a weed from the seedling stage into full bloom with its seeds spread out across the ground below it!</p>
<p>You can make your videos more fun and engaging. By recording multiple angles at the same time, you can capture all the exciting moments, like when something unexpected happens. Or when something amazing turns out to be a total disaster in real life. You can easily share with friends and family members who might not be able to come to see you in person.</p>

Today, Moviemakers use VHS static overlay to give their videos an antique and vintage look.</p>
<p>The VHS glitch overlay has become increasingly popular as it changes the video’s theme, tone, and whole look. Let’s see how we can add DIY VHS overlay in after effects-</p>
<h2 id="Part-1：Step-by-Step-DIY-VHS-Overlay-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1：Step-by-Step-DIY-VHS-Overlay-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：Step by Step DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?"></a>Part 1：Step by Step DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?</h2><p>The retro “VHS Look” has become relatively trendy in recent years. The memories associated with the popular VHS trend has helped the trend make a comeback. Creating this effect in After Effects may seem to be a complicated process if you have not tried it before. But we have made it easier for you to add VHS overlay in Adobe After Effects. Follow the steps to add it in after effects-</p>
<p>Before you begin, download and install VHS preset if you haven’t already. Remember that VHS preset only works with After Effects CC 2018 and up. So, make sure you have the recent version of After Effects or the one not older than the 2018 version.</p>
<p>Step 1: To create a VHS look on your video, drop any video of your choice into the project panel and give it a name, let’s say, “VCR static overlay”. Set the width and height to 1920 and 1080 px, respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing composition settings on after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Right-click on your video and select New Comp from Selection. Drag your video to a new composition and then go to Lumetri Color &lt; Basic Correction. Add some contrast. You can set it to 50 or any other number of your choice. Then bring the white level down to -55.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="getting lumetri color effect to get vhs look"
                ></p>
<p>Then open the Creative tab. Increase the faded film to 40. Set sharpening to -70. Bring vibrance to -30.</p>
<p>Note: Here, I changed the number to get the effect I wanted. You can change the numbers and set the values as per your requirements.</p>
<p>Now, click on the Curves option. Drag down the white curve and then align it with the original curve. Move the green curve up a bit and bring down the blue curve. Then comes the Vignette tab. Open it and set the number to -1.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="changing white green and blue curves on after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Now, we will give our video a subtle RGB spit appearance. For that, we need to use the Channel Blur effect twice. First, go to Effect &lt; Blur &amp; Sharpen &lt; Channel Blur. Set red blurriness to 20. Turn on the repeat edge pixels. Then change the Blur Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to vertical.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="giving rgb split appearance to video with channel blur"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Again, go to Effect &lt; Blur &amp; Sharpen &lt; Channel Blur. Set blue blurriness to 30. Repeat the process of checking the repeat edge pixels box. Change the Blue Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to horizontal.</p>
<p>Step 5: Next comes giving the video artificial sharpening look using Unsharp Mask. So, go to Effect &lt; Blur &amp; Sharpen &lt; Unsharp Mask. Under the Unmask Mask menu, set the amount to 100 and the radius to 10.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="using unsharp mask to give you video sharpening look"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: To add a font to your video, simply search VHS font on Google. Look for the one you want to use in your video and download it. To give your video that authentic VHS-style look, we suggest downloading free VCR OSD Mono font and installing the font on your system.</p>
<p>Step 7: Go to Layer &lt; New &lt; Solid and choose any color. We chose white. Now, under Effects &amp; Presets, search for a number. Drag it to the white solid. Choose the font VCR OSD Mono. You can change the number to time or date. You can also add time manually. Select the text tool, go to the source text, hold alt, and click on the stopwatch. Write “timeToCurrentFormat() and time will be displayed on the video. Let us say we want to see the date on the video instead of time. So, change the time to date. Drag the date to the bottom right of the video to give it the look of an old VHS tape.</p>
<p>If you are a beginner and want a simple VHS effect, you can follow these easy steps and create the VHS video that will transport you back to the 90s.</p>

<p>A conventional audio to text functionality works through listening to and recognizing a sound based input, followed by rendering a precise text centered transcript on a preferred system or device. The program’s voice recognition capability is the pivot behind this utility.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the credibility of punctuation in a text transcription?</strong></p>
<p>The transcription outputs rendered by a speech to text converter program use the comma to separate different elements and sections within the text, in the same way as you would normally do while writing a document with conventional methods.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the significance of a clean verbatim?</strong></p>
<p>A clean verbatim caters to a convenient readability of your audio-visual files through a slight customization process. This one is an accurately rendered transcription that keeps all the essential information within the recording, while eliminating the undesired, noisy background audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the usage credibility of speech to text programs for students?</strong></p>
<p>The speech to text converter programs are greatly beneficial for students in the sense that the latter works to remove a series of hindrances, like handwriting and speed matching difficulties, or transcription of thoughts during brainstorming sessions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Does working with a speech to text conversion facility require an internet connection?</strong></p>
<p>The requirement of internet connectivity is rather selective with respect to the specific converter program or application you are working with. While some of them may require you to remain online throughout the transcription process, other may work well in the offline mode of operation.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with speech to text conversion software and application programs becomes quite handy in addressing a variety of personal and professional documentation needs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Browsing through the software market, you can select from a diversity of free and paid smartphone apps and system software utilities to transcribe text from audio files</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When looking for a dependable <strong>speech to text software</strong> program, you can pick the Wondershare Filmora editor application without having a second thought.</p>

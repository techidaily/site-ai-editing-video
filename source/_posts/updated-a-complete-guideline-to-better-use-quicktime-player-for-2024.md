![choose video quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-10.jpg)

![khan academy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/khan-academy.jpg)

They are working hard to ensure that Khan Academy gives teachers of all stripes the tools they need to understand better the students' activities and how to assist them effectively. The Khan Academy teacher dashboard offers an overview of the overall performance of the class as well as comprehensive student profiles. Khan Academy is free, and anyone can learn anything. They are nonprofit because, according to Khan Academy, they believe in free, world-class education anywhere.

**Is Khan Academy suitable for learning?**

An excellent and convenient resource for academic study is Khan Academy. Anyone who desires to study may benefit from Khan, even though it is specially designed for kids in grade school through the college level stage. The website has several fantastic features, like the ability to enable subtitles for each video and the availability of the whole Khan Academy course in at least 18 other languages.

However, it would be convenient if the text-only material could use the built-in text-to-speech feature. Students may now access all courses using the Khan Academy app, which also enables downloading for offline learning. It's doubtful that many students will open Khan Academy and be eager to start using it because its organization and interface are both rather formal, and its activities are simple.

## SchoolTube (<https://www.schooltube.com/>)

\- is a secure platform for sharing videos without distraction-causing side video suggestions and advertising. Teachers and students can upload a YouTube video to their SchoolTube playlist. Still, all ancillary material, including advertising that would typically be included on the YouTube website, has been stripped off.

![school tube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/school-tube.jpg)

Many choices are available on the SchoolTube website, including the ability to submit movies, screenshot a device's display, record video inside the application, add attachments to films, and add a video quiz. Further exploration of the application reveals more possibilities for the editor. SchoolTube is suitable for teachers and students since it lets them contribute or make their movies with brand-new features that encourage more interactive learning in a secure digital setting.

**Is SchoolTube suitable for learning?**

This product is an excellent place to submit student-made movies or to obtain videos related to your classroom topics. The subject or topic they are discussing can be used to filter channels for students and teachers. I think it is a fantastic alternative to using YouTube, a more restricted site in the classroom. When you require students to watch films related to the ideas you are discussing, SchoolTube is a terrific resource to use. It is a safer or more closely supervised website than YouTube.

## TeacherTube (<https://www.teachertube.com/>)

\- is an online community for sharing instructional videos. They seek to offer a safe venue or site for teachers, schools, and students to access educationally focused videos. Currently, they provide an incredible 60 topics or subjects for all ages from Science, Math, History, Social Studies, Language & Arts, and more. They also have educational songs for kids and programming languages for the higher level. TeacherTube also provides anytime, anywhere professional development for teachers. And the site where teachers can post educational videos on their own designed for students to view to learn a concept or skill.

![teacher tube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/teacher-tube.jpg)

**Is TeacherTube suitable for learning?**

Despite being helpful in situations with no access to YouTube, this has a restricted search function. For each topic searched, there are just a few relevant search results. Results might range widely in terms of quality. If required, this would be a helpful resource, but it might be even better if it were more thorough.

## TED-Ed (<https://www.ed.ted.com/>)

\- the videos and courses on TED-Ed may be used to supplement practically any topic by adding video learning, knowledge tests, and conversation prompts. Students are likely to get immediately engaged with the content because it is outstanding and comes from some of the top brains in the world. Videos are excellent for group viewing or use in flipped classrooms.

![ed ted](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ed-ted.jpg)

You can use TED-Ed's videos and lessons to supplement almost any subject with video learning, basic knowledge checks, and discussion questions. Browse by topic or subtopic or search by keyword. You can filter by target age, content type, subtitles, etc. The content is remarkable and comes from some of the world's best minds, and the students will likely engage with it immediately. Videos can be great to watch as a class or to include as part of a flipped classroom.

**Is Ted-Ed suitable for learning?**

TED-Ed is a fantastic tool for students and instructors searching for inspiration, knowledge, and perhaps even some fun, thanks to the high-quality videos and the vast library of lesson ideas. The cartoons and films are just as well-made and engaging as some of the most remarkable television programming. The website presents a complicated subject intelligently, while a few students may feel bored or annoyed with videos on more advanced topics.

## Crash Course (<https://thecrashcourse.com/> _)_

Can provide a free high-quality educational video on various subjects. Crash Course also alters the traditional textbook model by presenting information in a fast-paced format to enhance students' learning experience. With the help of the Crash Course team, they created different kinds of videos on 21 subjects for high school and college learners.

![crash course](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crash-course.jpg)

Primary and Intermediate or grade school students can also use this site. According to Crash Course, they also have hundreds of millions of views on their YouTube channel. While the show is a beneficial tool for teachers and students, it also has an extensive viewership of casual learners seeking online educational content independently.

**Is Crash Course suitable for learning?**

The sarcastic tone and rapid speed of Crash Course will undoubtedly keep students intrigued, but the material is often dubious, and the videos offer primarily passive learning. Each Crash Course video's host is enthusiastic about the subject. The majority of the Crash Course videos are pretty accurate. However, in an attempt to simplify topics, several Crash Course Kids videos fall short.

## National Geographic Kids (<https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/>)

It offers educational videos, games, and other activities, especially on animals and the natural world. The students will enjoy playing games with simple instructions and a range of difficulties and frequently practice memory, logic, and other skills. They can contribute to the site by leaving some comments, taking quizzes, viewing user photos, and sharing their own.

![national geographic kids](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/national-geographic-kids.jpg)

**Is National Geographic Kids suitable for learning?**

The National Geographic Kids website is easy to navigate and contains exciting materials for students, while some content isn't properly structured and may be challenging to find. Clicking on a menu choice at the top of the screen leads you to a related page, but lingering over that same option brings up extra alternatives that you wouldn't see if you clicked. Keyword searches and links supplied by the teacher will be helpful here. For example, the site has tools such as a Homework Help section that teaches kids how to be an expert fact-checker, write an animal report, and more. Still, it's not precisely apparent how to get there unless you search for it.

## NeoK12 (<https://www.neok12.com/>)

Uses educational videos and animations for the students. It is a great way to learn, allowing the students to build a visual model in their minds by watching their videos. The graphical representation of the ideas aids their comprehension, piques their interest, and promotes self-directed learning in each learner. Educational videos in NeoK12 and games are possibly one of the most effective learning tools. Even the higher levels of students will find the platform enriching and entertaining. NeoK12's website also features tools not only for learners but also for teachers.

![neo k12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/neo-k12.jpg)

**Is NeoK12 suitable for learning?**

This platform is a rather extensive library of interesting educational tools, and the films and brain games are both free and well worth a look. Kids may augment the movie with other resources, such as interactive diagrams, flowcharts, fun, and puzzles, for a relatively inexpensive monthly charge. The films are simple teaching tools that usually contain supplementary resources that help youngsters to put what they've learned into practice. There are various "Universe" films, for example, under the Earth and Space area. Children who watch these films may also access relevant games, diagrams, activities, and photographs to prepare presentations.

## Discovery Education (<https://www.discoveryeducation.com/>)

Has made a name for itself as the top supplier of digital content, curriculum resources, and professional development for grades K–12\. Discovery Education is used by almost 5.6 million students in Canada, all 50 states, and other countries. Why not give it a shot in the Philippines or somewhere else in Asia?

![discovery education](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/discovery-education.jpg)

Teachers can use the free resources on Discovery Education to enhance their existing curriculum from the Grade School Level up to High School Level. An example of a tool with this platform is the Puzzlemaker, whose vocabulary makes crosswords and other types of puzzles. They can also be assigned specific videos or interactive activities to introduce new ideas at home.

**Is Discovery Education suitable for learning?**

Discovery Education is an excellent free resource. The commercial edition has considerably more resources, and after using it, I sincerely wished they would make it accessible for free or at a lower cost. The items aimed at students are straightforward and uninspiring; the website is intended for teachers. I would love to see them unlock more of the stuff that is locked behind the barrier, maybe in a cyclical manner where some films or resources are made available for free for a month at a time.

## Tips to Make Cinematic Color Grading

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

## Part 1\. What is Cinematic Color Grading?

The cinematic look is all the rage these days and aims to mimic images captured on real film rather than digitally created. To achieve this effect, film directors use various means from lighting to cinematic color gradation. The latter is a powerful tool for bringing a cool or warm tone to a video and providing smooth color transitions to fall on an image that doesn't look too real but feels emotional.

This kind of post-production processing, which produces beautiful results when used by color magicians, requires a deep understanding of colors and their effect on our psyche and even physiology. It's not enough to watch a color grading video and use a LUT to get where you want. You should at the very least have an understanding of:

* Color wheel
* Color quality
* Color harmony and discord
* Warm and cool colors
* Color context

## Part 2\. Tips to make cinematic color grading

Here are three helpful tips to create cinematic-looking images in DaVinci Resolve.

In my 10-year career as a colorist, I've worked on every type of content imaginable: short, long, commercial, educational, episodic—you name it. And while each of these formats requires its approach, the one constant that spans them all is the client's desire for a cinematic look.

Virtually all of us aspire to more cinematic color, but we often come up short—in part because the term itself has become too broad to effectively target. To focus on the goal, I like to think of "cinematic" as "an image whose key visual properties are consistent with those of printed film."

The print film was the primary medium through which we consumed cinematic images for the first century of filmmaking and is therefore at the very heart of cinematic aesthetics. In this video, I'll show you my top three secrets to achieving this aesthetic quickly and consistently in Davinci Resolve.

### Tips1: Create Color Density

The first secret to film color is to create color density. Another key aesthetic property of film images is that colors can be either highly saturated or highly luminescent but cannot be both.

We can mimic this visual characteristic by identifying strongly saturated colors in our image and using the Hue vs. Lum to reduce their brightness. This simple technique is especially effective on pure primary colors (red, green, and blue).

![create color density](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-1.jpg)

### Tips2: Separation Beats Saturation

The second secret to film color is prioritizing separation over saturation. When you feel like an image lacks overall color or pop, it's all too easy to reach for the saturation knob, but that's not a very cinematic solution.

Instead, try using split toning—pushing cool colors into shadows and warm colors into highlights—to increase tonal separation and add depth to an image. This characteristic is present in virtually every film print and is deeply evocative when applied correctly.

### Tips3: Strong Contrast is Your Friend

The third secret of film colors is a strong contrast. This is not always easy, as a higher contrast look inherently requires more precision with exposure placement. Too often we pump up some contrast, end up with an image that looks blown out or too crisp, and then immediately back away from editing.

However, if you stick with high contrast long enough to improve your exposure, you'll get a very different result and be well on your way to a more cinematic image.

## Part 3\. How to add color cinematic grading by using Filmora?

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an option if you want to easily change the colors of your projects. You may just double-click the media after dragging it onto the editing timeline to change the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue.

Despite its speed, it also allows you to merge, edit audio, divide, rotate, and apply as many cool video effects as you like.

##### Step1Add the media

After installing Wondershare Filmora, click the New Project and Import button to easily find and load your videos.

![add the media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

##### Step2Correct the color \[Basic and Advanced\]

In the timeline, double-click the video editing window. Select the **"Color"** panel and make adjustments.

![color panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

* Contrast: By adjusting this setting, you can control the brightness and color in different parts of the image.
* Saturation: This setting highlights the gray part of the video to a shade. You can adjust it to make the colors of the entire video image appear more saturated or more subdued.
* Brightness: You can change this setting to adjust the overall darkness and lightness of your project.
* Hue: Hue is generally the lightness of a color. Let's say that when red is saturated with white, it creates a shade of pink.
* 3D LUT: 3D lookup tables provide your media with Hollywood movie color sets like the 007 series, Batman, Harry Porter, etc.

Hover over the indicator to adjust the color correction settings. Then left click on it and move the slider. The corresponding value stabilizes after releasing the mouse button.

With Filmora, you also have access to advanced color correction. Click the Advanced Color Tuning icon to enter the appropriate window where you can fine-tune the color or use preset templates.

The Preferences tab has a variety of templates, including Movie, Normal, 3D LUT, and Vignette. In the Edit tab, you can adjust color temperature, white balance, hue, 3D LUT, color, HSL, light, vignette, etc.

##### Step3Preview and save the new video

When you are satisfied with your creation, click "Export". Then click the Settings button and save the new videos in different formats in the Format tab. You can also export the video directly to Vimeo or YouTube or burn it to DVD for better preservation.

Filmora's color correction tools will make your videos look natural, more attractive, more vibrant, consistent, and professional.

**Color Correction Presets**

[Color correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) presets help your video achieve an enhanced **cinematic look**. Adjust gives you control over fine-tuning the colors in your shots. You can make various adjustments such as color temperature and exposure.

In the **“Effects > LUT”** tab, you'll see an extensive selection of preset color settings. These include Vignettes, Movie Looks Like Old Movies, and Cinematic 3D LUT effects such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, and Mission Impossible.

![effects lut tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

Filmora's Color Correction Advanced Tool also categorizes your presets. Click on All Presents to see six categories: Favorites, Custom, 3D Lut, Common, Film, and Vignette.

![all presents](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-5.jpg)

Double-click a preset to apply it to your video. You can see how it looks in the Advanced Color Correction preview window. If you are satisfied with the results, click OK.

### Conclusion

Above are the steps to give your video a cinematic look using Wondershare Filmora, hope this helps if you are wondering how to do it. As we can see above, using Filmora video editor will make you more creative in making videos with a suitable emotional tone.

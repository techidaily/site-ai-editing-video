The **freeze-frame video editing** effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.

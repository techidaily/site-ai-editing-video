1. **Add the Video to the Timeline**

1. **Get Started With the Actual Video Editing**

To start, move the mouse cursor over the part of the uploaded video you would like to trim. Clip it out using the brackets. The trimmed-off part will remain enclosed in yellow brackets, while the rest of the video is unmarked. The current screen on your Lightworks editor changes to the Trim View mode. This leaves only the part of the video that has not been cut. Click on the Preview button under Viewer to start playing both videos in sequence.

1. **Export Your Video**

Once you’ve finished your edits, right click on your Sequence, and go to ‘Export’, with a drop-down menu showing how you would like to export the video. Please select, “/MP4 (Free)”. This will open a window where you should name your newly-edited file and give it a new destination, if necessary. Once you’ve selected and named, hit Start and the video with edits will begin to compile.

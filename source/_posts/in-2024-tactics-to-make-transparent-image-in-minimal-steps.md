## Part 1: Zoom In On TikTok After Recording

The Zoom In feature across any mobile platform has some specific uses and highlights a particular set of characteristics for its users. While using TikTok, you may find the need to highlight a certain section of the video that you've recorded to make it visible to users. It may be something that needs to be shown out of curiosity. To understand **how to zoom in on TikTok after recording,** go through the detailed steps presented as follows:

**Step 1:** You need to start the process of downloading and installing TikTok on your device. Launch it on your phone and proceed by clicking the "+" icon on the bottom of the screen to record or create a new video across TikTok.

![tap on plus icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-on-tiktok-videos-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Hold the red button of the recording and effectively create a video of your liking. Leave the button once you are done recording the video. As you've recorded the video, click on the "Tick" icon to proceed to the edit page of TikTok.

![record the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-on-tiktok-videos-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Find yourselves on the editing page of TikTok with a list of multiple editing options across the screen. Click on the "Effects" button and find the "Zoom" effect across the available list. To find the effect, let the editor cursor of the video reach the point where you want to add the Zoom in effect. Once it reaches the point of the video, hold the "Zoom" effect button for the specific time that you want to add the effect to your video. You can then conclude editing your video on TikTok and proceed to save it.

### Advantages of Zooming Videos After Recording

* This puts you in more control of the video rather than improvising the need to zoom in on a video during recording.
* Zoom into the specific part or portion of the video that you find necessary for covering the purpose. You cannot perform such actions while recording a video since the recording is quite restricted across a device.
* Adding zoom in effect across the video gives it a proper effect that enhances the quality rather than depreciating it.

### Disadvantages of Zooming Videos After Recording

* If you put in a zoom in effect on your video, this cannot be reverted back or zoomed out.
* The frame rate of the video is heavily damaged by using such effects across your recorded video. As this is done through the software, there is a guaranteed decrease in the quality output of the video.

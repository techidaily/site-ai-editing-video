Step 2: Click a server on the left-hand panel to open a list of all the text and voice chat channels on the same server.

If you want to send over a GIF in a direct message, tap the figurehead icon in the up-left corner of your screen. It will open a list of all candid message conversations.

Step 3: Click a chat below TEXT CHANNELS. On the left navigation area, find the chat you want to post a GIF to and click on it to open the conversation.

Step 4: Click the File upload tab. It looks like an skyward arrow inside a square besides the message field and below of your screen. This will open a file explorer in a pop-up window.

You can choose to drag-drop a GIF file from your PC without the upload option by opening the folder where your GIF is stored, and dragging the file to your Discord chat window.

Step 5: Find and pick a GIF from your PC. Browse the folders in the file explorer, and then tap on the GIF you want to send.

Step 6: Tap the Open button in the pop-up screen. It will import the GIF into your Chatbox and you can review your GIF before sending.

Step 7: Now, you may add a text to your GIF or type a line or a text in the text window right under the GIF.

You can also make use of emojis in your comment by clicking the smiley icon to the right of the text field.

Step 8: Finally, click the Upload tab, a white button in the lower-right corner of the pop-up window. This will send your GIF to the chat.

## Part 1 What GIF/Video Can Crash Discord (Explained)?

As a result of the fact that some GIFs/Videos can crash Discord due to the RAM overload method within the GIF/Video file, hidden contents out of frame probably. More so, there are GIF/ Video that makes your Discord client reload. As soon as you see it play, your Discord will reload like it does when pressing "ctrl + r." This bug does not work on the iOS client since the Gif appears as an image (so far tested in windows and iOS clients)

**_Preparation:_**

First, you need to create a close-up eye video. Although you can do that with your digital camera, a standard smartphone should do it just fine. Just ask a friend or family member to use your phone's rear camera to record your eye centered on the screen. Ensure that the eye is as close as possible and you don't lose focus. The camera should be around 10cm away from your face. And lest I forget, the flash should be ON.

## How to Create an Eye-zoom Transition

##### Step 1 Align the video clips on Filmora

![align the video clips on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 Add a freeze frame to the video

Next, we want to add a freeze frame to the section where the eye opens fully. To do that, select the second video track and place the playhead where the eye is fully open. After that, right-click the video track, then choose the **Add Freeze Frame** option.

![add a freeze frame to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-2.jpg)

Now trim the first video track from where the freeze frame starts on the second video. Also, cut the second video track to leave only the freeze frame

##### Step 3 Add a masking effect to the eye

With the two video tracks ready, it's time to apply a masking effect. Tap the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and then find the **Shape Mask** under the utility section. Now drag and drop the effect to the freeze frame.

![add a masking effect to the eye](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-3.jpg)

Double-click on the freeze frame clip to adjust the Shape Mask on the preview screen. Ensure the mask reveals the eye pupil only and check the **Invert Mask** box. Also, set the **Feather** number to 10.

![double-click on the freeze frame clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-4.jpg)

##### Step 4 Add the transition video

Next, add the video you want to edit with an eye-zoom effect next to the first video track. Preview the video, and you'll notice your new video playing inside the eye mask.

With that done, move the playhead to the start of the freeze frame video and double-click the video clip to launch the settings window. Click the **Animation** tab before clicking **Customize** to see the keyframe settings. Tap the **Add** button to add a keyframe. Then, add a few frames using the playhead before clicking Add. But because we're zooming in, increase the scale to 160%. You can also add the rotation and position.

![add the transition video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-5.jpg)

## Cropping a Video in Davinci Resolve [Step by Step]

Sometimes, when it comes to editing a video, we don’t even know where to start, because there are too many options –online platforms which instantly help us edit our clips, without lengthy process of downloading and installing computer programs;

Mobile applications with user-friendly interface, allowing us to manipulate the footage quickly, easily choose our preferred formats and effects and adjust the clips according to the requirements our target platforms set; more time-consuming and advanced software with even more options, but which seem to require us to be more skilled and experienced in editing.

Even though editing, as other innovative and creative actions, is limitless in its possibilities, sometimes we just need to make a little change in our project and it’s quite enough for us to be satisfied with our work and material. One of the things which is rather simple to do, but sometimes essential, when it comes to making our clips better and more picturesque for the audience, is cropping a video.

Cropping, in its essence, is great to “hide” some unnecessary objects in our video, and/or highlight the main ones. In this article, we discuss how to crop a video in a software called DaVinci Resolve, in simple little steps, how to export our work and lastly, what would be the alternate way to do the same in other computer program.

## Part 1\. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve

First and foremost, let’s get to know Davinci Resolve! As mentioned above, it is a software, so let’s be well-aware that we have to download and install it on our computer systems. Of course, it takes a bit of time, but to be able to use an advanced software, it’s totally worth it. If we are to search for the information about Davinci Resolve, we come across the following description: “color grading and non-linear video editing application for macOS, Windows, and Linux”. So, no matter which system we have, we can count on this software, which is a real advantage!

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-1.jpeg)

To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c).

Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!

First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.

## How to Apply Color Correction in OBS

When you carry out basic edits to your videos or images with OBS and realize that your project has poor shade, color, or tone, you don’t have to export it to another software to correct it. Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.

Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.

There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:

#### 1\. Gamma

Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast. To be precise, Gamma works almost similarly to change in brightness while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the contrast.

In editing, Gamma is applicable mainly for removing shiny foreheads and webcam footage in gaming and browsing.

High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”

#### 2\. Contrast

Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.

“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.

#### 3\. Brightness

Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.

High brightness in OBS is denounced by the letter “L,” whereas Low brightness is denounced by “R.”

#### 4\. Saturation

Saturation is the intensity of colors in a video or an image. High saturated images are bright, strong, and are rich, whereas the low saturated photos appear washed out. Black and white (grayscale) photos have no color saturation. In OBS, high saturation and low saturation are represented as “L” and “R.”

#### 5\. Hue Shift

Hue shift is the change in an image’s saturation, lightness, and hue colors. Hue shifting occurs when highlighting or shading images. In OBS, you can use the hue shift functionality to reimage your image with a completely different color palette.

With the hue shift functionality in OBS, you can place the image on top of another and have an 80% opacity. It means that you will still see the first image when you place the second one on top of it.

The “L” sign in the OBS hue shift represents 50% opacity, while the “R” represents 100% Opacity.

## Color Grade in OBS

Color grading is the process of enhancing the appearance of an image through attributes such as contrast, saturation, and color, making them enchanting for presentations. Color grading is not only done for still images but also for motion pictures and images.

Color grading functionality in OBS is encompassed with several tools – This includes:

#### 1\. Lift tool

As the name suggests, lift tools are used in lifting or removing specific colors from an image. It does so without necessarily affecting other colors in an image.

With this tool, you can selectively remove unwanted colors from your image or video, replace them with your desired ones, and create astonishing results.

#### 2\. Offset

Offset is another outstanding tool in OBS color grading that controls the blacks/Shadows of an image. It functions by altering the brightness levels and leaving the highlights and the mid-tones unaffected.

#### 3\. Gain

A gain is a tool in OBS color correction that functions by only adjusting the white levels in an image. With the gain tool, brighter colors become brighter or darker.

Many people, especially beginner editors, experience difficulty differentiating between the Gamma and Offset tools. Yes, there is a closer similarity between the two, and for you to be on the safe side, you need to know that Gamma goes with the mid-tones (middle gray levels) whereas the Gain goes with highlights/whites.

Step 18

Drag another White Sample Color to Track 5 this time. Adjust its duration and starting point to be the same as the clip above it. Double-click on it → go to **Video** → **Mask** → **Import.** Here, select the flipped text Snapshot we created earlier.

Step 19

Now, go to **Animation** and add a keyframe at the starting point. Then, compress the text on the preview screen exactly as we did before with the other one. Then, add a keyframe at the 1-second position of the clip. Then, adjust the **Y-axis** position to create a reflection effect, just like this.

![reflection effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reflection.png)

Step 20

Move the Playhead to the 5-second position and add a keyframe. Now, move the Playhead directly to 5-seconds and 22 frames. Here, reduce the **Opacity** to **0%.**

Step 21

Go back to the **Video** tab from the upper-left corner of the panel. Now, move the Playhead to the clip’s starting point. Select the **Mask** tab. Add a keyframe. Move the Playhead to 1 second and set the **Blur Strength** to **6%.**

![blur strength](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/blur.png)

Step 22

Move the Playhead to 3 seconds. Scroll down and set **Vertical** to **259%.** Set **Y-axis** to **“-157”.** Then, increase **Blur Strength** to **25%.** Click **OK.**

![blur effect settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/y-axis.png)

Step 23

Click on the Sample Color in Track 5 and change the **Opacity** to **40%** for the second and third keyframes. You can move between the keyframes on the arrows highlighted below. Click **OK.**

![move keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/keyframes.png)

Step 24

Go to **Sample Color** and drag the **“Gradient 4”** color to Track 7 on the Timeline. Allow this clip to start from the very beginning and adjust its end time to be the same as all the other clips.

Step 25

Double-click on the Gradient 4 clip → go to **Video** → **Basic.** Change the **Blending Mode** to **“Soft Light”**. Reduce the **Opacity** to **42%.** Click **OK.**

![sample color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/gradient.png)

Step 26

Go to **Project Media** and drag the white smoke clip on Track 8\. Place the Playhead at the starting point and double-click on the clip.

![project media filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/project-media.png)

Step 27

Change its **Blending Mode** to **“Screen”.** Go to the **Animation** tab and decrease the **Opacity** to **0%.** Move the Playhead to frame 10 → increase **Opacity** to **12%.** Move the Playhead to the 5-second position → add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead at 5 seconds and 23rd frame → increase the **Opacity** back to **100%.** Click **OK.**

Step 28

Go to **Effects** and drag the **Cinema** effect to Track 9\. Adjust its duration to match all the other clips. Double-click on the clip and increase its **Border Height** to **“0.10”.** Click **OK.**

![border height](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/border.png)

Step 29

Finally, Render the video and watch the final result. You’re done! Congratulations on resting a foggy text reflection effect in Filmora.

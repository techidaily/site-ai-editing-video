The selection of the theme can make a huge difference to the overall creation of the slideshow.

Choose a design and keep adding the elements.

### 05Add An Appropriate Music

No matter how well created your wedding slideshow is, it looks incomplete until a music file is added. Depending on your slideshow theme you can either choose simple soft music, a peppy latest song, or any other audio file. The favorite song of the couple can also be included. Using an audio editing tool, you can add multiple audio clips to create a single file to be used for the slideshow.

Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is definitely possible Usually, people use video collage makers for this reason. But you can also create an actual photo collage with music as well (no need to use actual video clips if you don’t want to.)

In the end, it all depends on the collage maker you’re using to be completely honest. In this case, the collage maker in question would have to have video editing functionalities advanced enough to allow you to create a video consisting of a picture collage with music Learn more about the different tools that you can check out below as we break down some of the best of the best available

## 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the video makers that we’re going to be introducing is called Filmora. This is a professional editor that’s equipped with just about everything you need for creating high-quality video content. That includes the things that you will need in order to create a **music photo collage**

For your reference, that means that you can use it to create a video showing off a picture collage with music. Usually by making use of the templates provided by the software and uploading your own images (although, in the newest version of Filmora, Filmora V11, there is a ‘Stock Media’ option that includes an endless supply of photographs, videos, music, etc. for adding to your content.)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

## 02 Canva

Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a **picture collage with music**

Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)

## 03 Express It

You can say that "Express It" is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a **photo collage with music** **app** that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.

Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.

## 04 Smilebox

Smilebox is an automatic video collage maker that is capable of turning photographs into a video collage without much input from you It’s the tool to use if all you’re looking for is a quick solution. By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety

It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your **music photo collage**

![Smilebox - Create Pic Collage with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker4.png)

## 05 Fotojet

Next is ‘Fotojet’, which is an online collage maker that is incredibly popular for those that are looking for an easy solution. It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done

Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free **music photo collage** tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.

## 06 Vimeo

Video is a professional online photo editing tool that’s incredibly popular with entrepreneurs. It actually works very similarly with all the other tools that we’ve introduced so far. That means that it comes with templates that you can use in order to create projects, it also comes with a ‘resources’ library that you can take advantage of in order to fill up said projects

As for creating a **photo collage with music** by using this tool. You will need to sign up to start creating, but it’s FREE to try — with some elements locked under the premium version.

## 07 Kapwing

KapWing is exactly what it looks like, it’s an online photo editor The best part about it is that it comes with quick collage layouts that you can use and the usual resources library. The layouts in question are customizable, allowing you to control what your **music photo collages** look like in the end. You also have the choice of creating said collage with photos, videos, GIFs, and music

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

### Method 1: Correct Color Distortion in Videos Using Filmora

Filmora is user-friendly software with powerful tools that allow users to tweak the color settings and correct color distortion. Follow the steps below to learn how to correct color distortion in videos using Filmora.

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

* The paid version is very expensive in comparison to others.

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

### Cons

* It does not have a preview. You have to generate the voice-over to listen.
* You can't combine a single audio file out of many audio files.
* The Voiceover & Editor Page is unique in that it has two sections: one for creating the voice-over and another for obtaining audio files. Switching between them will take some time. If you're working on a large project, moving between bot sites will be a hassle.
* No project-based organization

### Cons

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

You should check for text-to-speech software with natural voices enabled in commercial applications. A top-rated system should include real-time speech capabilities and a user-friendly UI.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

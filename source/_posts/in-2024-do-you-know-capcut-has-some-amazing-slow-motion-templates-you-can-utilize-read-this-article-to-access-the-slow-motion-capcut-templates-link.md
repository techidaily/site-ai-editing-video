02 [Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

## Part 2 How to Remove the Background from an Animated Gif in Photoshop

Photoshop is popularly known for being a photo manipulation and editing software. But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.

**Step 1: Import The GIF File**

This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the "File" menu of Photoshop. Then tap on "Open" and double click on the desired GIF file.

![import file photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Set Up The Project**

It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (**gif remove bg**). For this:

Find the "Video Group" option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the "Ungroup layers" option.

![ungroup video photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg)

You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.

**Step 3: Begin The Editing Part**

Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.

For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.

To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.

**Step 4: Delete The Transparent GIF Background**

Now, delete the background of each frame of your GIF. To delete the background of any particular frame, click on that frame. For this, you can either use a "Quick Selection Tool" or a "Polygonal Lasso Tool". You will get the final result that will be background free.

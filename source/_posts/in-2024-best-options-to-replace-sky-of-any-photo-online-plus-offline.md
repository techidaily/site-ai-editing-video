## 4 Methods to Crop a Video on Android Easily

Nowadays, we can use our mobile phones to create almost anything – they have become an indivisible part of our lives. Most of the people check their mobile phones every 2 minutes – did they receive a new message?

What about different kinds of notifications – reactions on social network, or the ones which inform us about breaking news, or, to-do lists? People are well-connected to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and sometimes, we just want to update our accounts with just photos or new videos we took on the go. Sometimes, we have a perfect footage we took with our Android, but we have no idea, or just no time to edit our stunning video clips on the computer.

Yes, changing or adjusting a video shouldn’t be that hard – you shouldn’t be obligated to turn to Adobe Premiere Pro or other “heavy” software in order to have a video to your whole liking. Therefore, we have mobile applications just for editing our videos, in a simple, and fast way (thank you, mobile developers!).

In this article, we will be discussing how to crop a video on Android, but since most android devices don’t have this option, you will need to do it externally, by downloading and using different apps. So, more concretely, we will touch upon how to crop our video clips using following apps: Google Photos, Clideo, and Filmora.

## Using Google Photos

In case you have Android, the Google Photos app will be there – it’s free and in most cases, already installed and ready to serve you. If you can’t find Google Photos, just find it and download it from the Google Play Store.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-1.jpeg)

First off, you just open the application and allow it to access photos and media on your device. Tap the video you would like to crop. Then, click on Edit: it will launch the in-app video editor.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-2.jpeg)

At the bottom, you will see the Crop option and hit on it, which will result in appearing a cropping box around your video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-3.jpeg)

Once you see little icons at the bottom, you need to choose the first one – it’s the Ratio button, through which you can choose the aspect you would like to apply. Your choice is between these several aspect ratios: Free, Original, Square, 5:4, 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-4.jpeg)

Choosing Free ratio option gives you the freedom to adjust the cropping sliders manually, in order to resize the video to any aspect ratio; it is even possible to rotate the clip, pinch, and zoom in/out.

After you are done with adjusting your video, you need to click on the Save Copy button, which will save a new edited version of your footage. And, meanwhile, don’t worry! – this will not be overwritten on the original one, which will still stand intact.

## Using Clideo

Clideo is an interesting one… it doesn’t require you to download anything, because there is a way to crop your video online, through the web browser on Android.

First off, you need to click on [Clideo’s Android crop video tool](https://clideo.com/crop-video) from the browser on the smartphone. You will see a Choose File button and hit on it – this will take you to your gallery and let you find the clip you are about to crop.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-5.jpeg)

You can also upload your file from Cloud Storage. You need to click on the down-arrow on the right-hand side of the button and you’ll find the option to add a clip from your Dropbox or Google Drive account.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-6.jpeg)

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-7.jpeg)

After your file is uploaded, Clideo will take you to the editing page, where you can select the area you would like to be in the edited version, and crop the video. Here, you will be able to choose the aspect ratio, exact size of the video and the format.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-8.jpeg)

Once you have finished with the cropping and settings, you need to click on Export which will process your edited video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-9.jpeg)

## Using Filmora

Filmora is an android version of software Filmora and it also gives you the opportunity to crop videos and photos with no problem. First, of course, you have to download the application from Google Play Store, and open it;

Once you have chosen your file, you click on Next button and you proceed to the editor itself.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-13.jpeg)

 It doesn’t show you the option Crop right away, but Crop is “hidden” behind the Trim button!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-14.jpeg)

So, you choose Trim, then find Crop and hit that, and then you are free to choose any aspect ratio: 1:1; 4:5; 16:9; 9:16; and 5:4\. You can crop the video manually, too, and you are able to adjust where your new “screen” might be wanted most.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-15.jpeg)

## How To Fade Audio In Kinemaster

If you have been looking for video and audio editing tools then you have probably heard of Kinemaster. It is a great video editing app that allows users to edit all aspects of the video including any audio or music that may accompany the video. It has a lot of very useful features and the user interface is fairly easy to use.

One of the things that you can do with Kinemaster is to fade out audio, a useful feature that can help the ending of any video appear more authentic. In this article, we will be looking at how you can use Kinemaster to fade audio.

## Kinemaster Fade Audio Steps

The following steps show you how you can easily fade audio in Kinemaster;

Step1If you don't have Kinemaster already, start by downloading and installing the video editor on your computer.

Step2Open Kinemaster on your computer and then click on the “New Project” icon to start. Select the aspect ratio that you would like to use. If you are not sure, we recommend choosing the “16:9” aspect ratio.

![add new project kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-new-project-kinemaster.jpg)

Step3In the next window, click on “Media” to select the clip you would like to add to the Kinemaster project that you have just created.

![click media kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-media-kinemaster.jpg)

Step4To fade in and fade out the audio in the project, click on the gear icon from the options to the left of the screen.

![click gear icon kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-gear-icon-kinemaster.jpg)

Step5Select the “Audio” tab on the next screen and then turn on the switch next to “Audio Fade-in (Start of Project)” and “Audio Fade-out (End of Project).” This will add a fade-in and fade-out effect at the beginning of the audio and at the end of it.

Step6You can then easily set the duration of the “Audio fade-in” and “Audio fade-out” by dragging the slider below each option. We recommend setting the duration to just a few seconds.

Don't forget to save the project when you're done.

## Kinemaster Alternative to Edit Audio

Kinemaster is a good way to edit both audio and video on your computer, but the following options are just as good;

### 1\. VideoShop

VideoShop is a simple to use and highly effective program that you can use to create and edit videos on your computer. The interface makes it easy to import any video project that you have into the program and the wealth of very useful features can help you edit the video in various ways.

For example, you can change the speed of the video, add transitions at various points in the video, add and remove text, add and remove music and so much more. Although there is a free trial version, you will only be able to access some of the more useful features when you purchase the premium version.

The Pro version of VideoShop goes for $3.99 a month, but you can get lifetime access to the program for only $39.99\. One thing that VideoShop has over Kinemaster is that it is very easy to use, even beginner users find video editing a breeze with this tool.

### 2\. Filmora

If you are looking for a simple way to edit videos on Android or iOS devices, Filmora is one of the best options in the market. This mobile version of the very popular [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor is just as easy to use as its parent program. You can use it to create video projects from scratch or upload a video and make changes to it.

It offers you a lot of choices when it comes to editing features including trimming sections of the video, adding filters, adding music, adding or removing text, and even changing the canvas or the background of the video. Advanced options such as changing the speed of the video are also available.

One of the things that we love about Filmora is that you don't even have to create an account to use it or remove the watermark added to the completed video project, watching a video ad can be enough. But this option is only available once every 24 hours, meaning that you can only remove a watermark on the free version once a day. Filmora is available for both iOS and Android and the yearly premium plan will cost you just $19.90.

### 3\. Quik

Quik is a video editing program created by GoPro for the purpose of editing GoPro videos, but that doesn't mean that you will not be able to use it to edit other types of videos. You can use Quik to create a new project or edit an existing video and gives users a lot of different options when it comes to video editing.

One of the main benefits of using Quik is that you can easily add music, audio, and special effects to a video as well as change the length of the video, fade audio in and out and even change when the music starts. It is also one of the best ways to use images to create collages and slideshows very easily. There are a lot of slideshow and collage templates to choose from, and you can edit them easily by adding your music and images. Quik is completely free to use and you can upload your creation to the cloud ad share the link with others.

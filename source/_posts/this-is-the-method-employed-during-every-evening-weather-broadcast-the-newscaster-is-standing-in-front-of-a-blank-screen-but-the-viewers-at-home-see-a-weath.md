## This Is the Method Employed During Every Evening Weather Broadcast: The Newscaster Is Standing in Front of a Blank Screen, but the Viewers at Home See a Weather Map

Chroma key with gimp green screen is the method by which photographers (and videographers) use a monochromatic backdrop, then replace the blue or green "screen" with a virtual background. This is the method employed during every evening weather broadcast: the newscaster is standing in front of a blank screen, but the viewers at home see a weather map.

Green screen Chroma key can also be used with photography. Subjects can be photographed in front of a monochromatic screen, and a virtual background can be put behind the subject once the screen is removed. For example, a duck can be photographed in front of a green or blue tarp, which is then replaced by a photograph of a river.

## How to use green screen in gimp

If you take a picture with a solid colored background (blue or green works best), then you can have a computer program pull out the blue or green pixels and replace them with another color or a transparent layer. This process is called "chroma key" and is used in weather forecasts and other special effects. The terms "green screen" and "blue screen" also refer to the chroma key process.

These directions outlined below describe how to use GIMP to add a transparent layer and remove blue or green pixels from an image. This allows you to layer images on different backgrounds or use pictures as Sprites in Scratch or Greenfoot.

Brief outline of process:

1. Start GIMP
2. Open the picture file.
3. Create an "Alpha Channel" (Transparent Pixels)
4. Select "Like Colored Pixels" (Click on the Green or Blue background)
5. Control->K to delete the pixels and reveal the Transparent background.
6. Save the picture as a .gif file. (Not .jpg!)

Detailed Directions:

1. Start GIMP: (The "Gnu Image Manipulation Program")
2. Click the "K" menu
3. Select "Graphics"
4. Select "GIMP Image Editor"

Note about the GIMP:

Most computer applications run in one window. GIMP will run different windows for each function or object you are working with. (Separate windows for paintbrush menus, images, backgrounds, etc . . .)

1. Select "File-> Open"
2. Navigate to your File Area and select a chroma key picture
3. Once your picture opens, add the "Alpha Channel"  
a. Select "Layer" from the picture menu bar  
b. Select “Transparency”  
c. Select "Add Alpha Channel"
4. Click the "Select Region by Color" icon.
5. Click once on the green or blue color in the background.
6. Press "Control -> K" on the keyboard to delete the colors. The background will appear as a gray checkerboard pattern.
7. Repeat the click and "Control-K" process to remove the background colors.
8. Once the background colors are removed, save the picture:  
a. Select "File-Save As" from the menu bar.  
b. Type "LastnamePicture.gif" as the filename.
9. Select "Convert to Indexed" - Click Export
10. Click “OK”
11. the picture should save.
12. You can now use this picture in Scratch for a sprite, or in other graphics projects to combine with backgrounds.

### Paint.Net

Paint.net is a free and very capable image editing software for Windows. Great alternative to Photoshop for people that do not need all the stuff PS offers.

In order to handle multiple images easily, Paint.NET uses a tabbed document interface. The tabs display a live thumbnail of the image instead of a text description. This makes navigation very simple and fast. Extensive work has gone into making Paint.NET the fastest image editor available. Whether you have a netbook with a power-conscious Atom CPU, or a Dual Intel Xeon workstation with 16+ blazingly fast processing cores, you can expect Paint.NET to start up quickly and be responsive to every mouse click.

Key Features

* ****Performance**

Extensive work has gone into making Paint.NET the fastest image editor available. Whether you have a netbook with a power-conscious Atom CPU, or a Dual Intel Xeon workstation with 16+ blazingly fast processing cores, you can expect Paint.NET to start up quickly and be responsive to every mouse click.

* ****Layers**

Usually only found on expensive or complicated professional software, layers form the basis for a rich image composition experience. You may think of them as a stack of transparency slides that, when viewed together at the same time, form one image.

* ****Automatically Updated**

Updates are free, and contain new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Upgrading to the latest version is very simple, requiring only two clicks of the mouse.

* ****Special Effects**

Many special effects are included for enhancing and perfecting your images. Everything from blurring, sharpening, red-eye removal, distortion, noise, and embossing are included. Also included is our unique 3D Rotate/Zoom effect that makes it very easy to add perspective and tilting. Adjustments are also included which help you tweak an image's brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, curves, and levels. You can also convert an image to black and white, or sepia-toned.

* ****Powerful Tools**

Paint.NET includes simple tools for drawing shapes, including an easy-to-use curve tool for drawing splines or Bezier curves. The Gradient tool, new for 3.0, has been cited as an innovative improvement over similar tools provided by other software. The facilities for creating and working with selections is powerful, yet still simple enough to be picked up quickly. Other powerful tools include the Magic Wand for selecting regions of similar color, and the Clone Stamp for copying or erasing portions of an image. There is also a simple text editor, a tool for zooming, and a Recolor tool.

* ****Unlimited History**

Everybody makes mistakes, and everybody changes their mind. To accommodate this, __every_ action you perform on an image is recorded in the History window and may be undone. Once you've undone an action, you can also redo it. The length of the history is only limited by available disk space.

### Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is the commercial image editor that set the standard in creative illustration and design work with a sophisticated, layer-based workflow and robust, professional feature set.

Over the years, Photoshop developed from a small photo editing tool to an Industry-leading software that dictates the global graphic designing and multimedia industries. With every new version, Adobe introduces in the Photoshop; the graphic designing communities wait to check out the next big leap where Photoshop can take them.

Key Features of Adobe Photoshop

* **Layers**

With Layers palette, you can draw or design various elements of your document independently in layers and stack them up as per the order of display. With this advantage, control over every single object is catered at the click of a mouse. Mistakes happen, but the effects of the mistake are limited to the part of the canvas; you can choose to work on the particular part and leave the rest of the canvas as it is. This benefit is lacking in the traditional painting method. Artists are not allowed to relax at any part of the drawing or painting once their concentration is diverted and a stroke of painting goes wrong! They are bound to change the whole canvas.

* **Selection Tools**

Photoshop’s selection tools are so handy to use that designers worldwide are addicted to the set of selection tools Photoshop offers. However, there are a bunch of competitive software and open-source software designed to give tough competition for Photoshop. Users are still stuck with Adobe’s torch bearer software due to the ease its tools provide.

* **Pen Tool**

Today, Photoshop cannot be imagined without a Pen tool. Though the pen tool, by nature, works for drawing paths along with the anchor points, the creative scope it provides is limitless. The tool is designed so flexibly that the designer can draw any shape or edit the existing shapes as good as he is using his bare hand. The amount of control we have through placing the anchor points in the right places is taken further with the three types of Anchor points that can allow you to draw and edit paths precisely.

* **Shapes**

The outlook of the shape layers in Photoshop may be limited, but the capabilities of the feature go a step further than what we assume about it. In the traditional marquee selection tools, the selection is limited to the raster process, and in many cases, the output will result in the sharp pixilated edges, which are never good looking. But the shape layers can act as an individual object within the document with its attribute to maintain the finest quality.

* **Vector Mask**

The layer masks create a masking portion of an object by using the grayscale color combination (Shades of Gray). Once the masking part is done, the area of the object under the layer mask disappears.

* **Retouching Tools**

Retouching tools are an accumulation of various tools such as Stamp tool, Pattern Stamp tool, Spot Healing tool, Healing tool, Patch tool, Redeye tool and much more. Though the numbers are more, every tool has its importance. The development of retouching tools did not happen overnight. Adobe was working hard identifying the problems of the photographers and finding the solutions for the problems from time to time.

### Affinity Photo

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

### Pixlr

You do not have to open your laptop or go to your desktop for simple needs.

* ****Spot heal**

Super useful, the spot heal tool can help remove scratches or blemishes by simply clicking on the area. Additional options: Besides size of brush, you have a choice of Pixlr choosing to blend the area with nearby area values or generate a pattern. Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

## How to use green screen in gimp

If you take a picture with a solid colored background (blue or green works best), then you can have a computer program pull out the blue or green pixels and replace them with another color or a transparent layer. This process is called "chroma key" and is used in weather forecasts and other special effects. The terms "green screen" and "blue screen" also refer to the chroma key process.

These directions outlined below describe how to use GIMP to add a transparent layer and remove blue or green pixels from an image. This allows you to layer images on different backgrounds or use pictures as Sprites in Scratch or Greenfoot.

Brief outline of process:

1. Start GIMP
2. Open the picture file.
3. Create an "Alpha Channel" (Transparent Pixels)
4. Select "Like Colored Pixels" (Click on the Green or Blue background)

### Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is the commercial image editor that set the standard in creative illustration and design work with a sophisticated, layer-based workflow and robust, professional feature set.

Over the years, Photoshop developed from a small photo editing tool to an Industry-leading software that dictates the global graphic designing and multimedia industries. With every new version, Adobe introduces in the Photoshop; the graphic designing communities wait to check out the next big leap where Photoshop can take them.

Key Features of Adobe Photoshop

* **Layers**

With Layers palette, you can draw or design various elements of your document independently in layers and stack them up as per the order of display. With this advantage, control over every single object is catered at the click of a mouse. Mistakes happen, but the effects of the mistake are limited to the part of the canvas; you can choose to work on the particular part and leave the rest of the canvas as it is. This benefit is lacking in the traditional painting method. Artists are not allowed to relax at any part of the drawing or painting once their concentration is diverted and a stroke of painting goes wrong! They are bound to change the whole canvas.

* **Selection Tools**

Photoshop’s selection tools are so handy to use that designers worldwide are addicted to the set of selection tools Photoshop offers. However, there are a bunch of competitive software and open-source software designed to give tough competition for Photoshop. Users are still stuck with Adobe’s torch bearer software due to the ease its tools provide.

* **Pen Tool**

Today, Photoshop cannot be imagined without a Pen tool. Though the pen tool, by nature, works for drawing paths along with the anchor points, the creative scope it provides is limitless. The tool is designed so flexibly that the designer can draw any shape or edit the existing shapes as good as he is using his bare hand. The amount of control we have through placing the anchor points in the right places is taken further with the three types of Anchor points that can allow you to draw and edit paths precisely.

* **Shapes**

The outlook of the shape layers in Photoshop may be limited, but the capabilities of the feature go a step further than what we assume about it. In the traditional marquee selection tools, the selection is limited to the raster process, and in many cases, the output will result in the sharp pixilated edges, which are never good looking. But the shape layers can act as an individual object within the document with its attribute to maintain the finest quality.

* **Vector Mask**

The layer masks create a masking portion of an object by using the grayscale color combination (Shades of Gray). Once the masking part is done, the area of the object under the layer mask disappears.

* **Retouching Tools**

Retouching tools are an accumulation of various tools such as Stamp tool, Pattern Stamp tool, Spot Healing tool, Healing tool, Patch tool, Redeye tool and much more. Though the numbers are more, every tool has its importance. The development of retouching tools did not happen overnight. Adobe was working hard identifying the problems of the photographers and finding the solutions for the problems from time to time.

### Affinity Photo

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

The tool is designed so flexibly that the designer can draw any shape or edit the existing shapes as good as he is using his bare hand. The amount of control we have through placing the anchor points in the right places is taken further with the three types of Anchor points that can allow you to draw and edit paths precisely.

* **Shapes**

The outlook of the shape layers in Photoshop may be limited, but the capabilities of the feature go a step further than what we assume about it. In the traditional marquee selection tools, the selection is limited to the raster process, and in many cases, the output will result in the sharp pixilated edges, which are never good looking. But the shape layers can act as an individual object within the document with its attribute to maintain the finest quality.

* **Vector Mask**

The layer masks create a masking portion of an object by using the grayscale color combination (Shades of Gray). Once the masking part is done, the area of the object under the layer mask disappears.

* **Retouching Tools**

Retouching tools are an accumulation of various tools such as Stamp tool, Pattern Stamp tool, Spot Healing tool, Healing tool, Patch tool, Redeye tool and much more. Though the numbers are more, every tool has its importance. The development of retouching tools did not happen overnight. Adobe was working hard identifying the problems of the photographers and finding the solutions for the problems from time to time.

### Affinity Photo

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

### Pixlr

You do not have to open your laptop or go to your desktop for simple needs.

* ****Spot heal**

Super useful, the spot heal tool can help remove scratches or blemishes by simply clicking on the area. Additional options: Besides size of brush, you have a choice of Pixlr choosing to blend the area with nearby area values or generate a pattern. Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

## Part 1\. What Are The Benefits of Adding Text Behind Objects in Videos?

Your videos must maintain quality to create content worthy of a huge audience. You may have a YouTube channel or be starting down the road. Then you must give this a try because

### Give a cool look

Adding text behind an object in a video looks cool! Now, your object could be a silhouette of a person or a huge skyscraper. You can add a text tile behind the object, creating the illusion. Due to this, the text will be flying in real-time.

### Show creativity

Blasting your channel with innovative and creative content is the key to building a big audience. But, of course, you can always opt for many ways to create a video showing your creativity. One of those ways is to add text behind your object.

You can create an attractive intro by adding text behind objects that captivate the viewer. It ensures that your subscribers stay tuned to your channel and your content.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let's dive into it.

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.
* When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.

![add the footage to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-12.png)

##### Step2 Add the text tile

To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.

* Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.
* On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.
* Select the Plain text option.
* You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.
* Select the text title that suits you best.

![add the text tile above the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png)

* Our next step would be to add the text.
* **Double-click** on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.
* Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, **"Hello world."**
* You can also adjust the font of your text.
* Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.
* Select the font you desire.

![type in the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png)

Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.

##### Step3 Take a snapshot

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

![taking a snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png)

* In the main play screen, you can notice a small **camera icon**.
* This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.
* Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.
* Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.

![snapshot is saved in the import library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

Now that you know the requirements for the video, let's move on to the step-by-step guide to add text to your video.

## Part 3\. Step-by-Step Guide To Add Text Behind Videos

We look at two examples of how to add text behind videos in Wondershare Filmora.

* A static video with an object that can be easily masked out.
* A video with high contrast and a clean background.

### Add Text behind a Static Video

After downloading the Wondershare Filmora software, let's edit the video. Scroll below to learn how to start the editing process!

##### Step2 Add the Video to the Timeline

We will first look at the static video example. For this, follow the below instructions:

* You have to start by importing your video in the import library.
* From the import library, you can click on the video and drag it down below to the timeline.

![adding video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let's dive into it.

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.
* When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.

![add the footage to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-12.png)

##### Step2 Add the text tile

To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.

* Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.
* On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.
* Select the Plain text option.
* You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.
* Select the text title that suits you best.
* After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.

![add the text tile above the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png)

* Our next step would be to add the text.
* **Double-click** on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.
* Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, **"Hello world."**
* You can also adjust the font of your text.
* Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.
* Select the font you desire.

![type in the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png)

Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.

##### Step3 Take a snapshot

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

![taking a snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png)

* In the main play screen, you can notice a small **camera icon**.
* This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.
* Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.
* Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.

![snapshot is saved in the import library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:

* Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.
* Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.

* If it is **longer** than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.
* If its length is **smaller** than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.

![adjust the length of the snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png)

After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.

##### Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot

To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text's blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

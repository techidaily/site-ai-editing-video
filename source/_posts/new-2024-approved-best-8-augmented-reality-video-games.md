While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle.

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

## How to Create Vintage Film Effect 1950S

So, what's the difference between a vintage film shot in the 1920s and 1950s? It's simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let's learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.

## Preparation

![1950 vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1950-vintage-scene.gif)

Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn't need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It's even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent's collection.

How to create a 1950s vintage film:

##### Step 1 Add your video on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![add your video on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-1.jpg)

First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.

##### Step 2 Apply a cropping effect to the video

![apply a cropping effect to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-2.jpg)

Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and choose the **Crop** effect under the **Utility** folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.

![click the effect tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-3.jpg)

Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.

##### Step 3 Add a Warm Film color effect

![add a warm film color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-4.jpg)

Up to here, you'll realize that your video doesn't still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the **3D LUT** option under the **Color** category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose **Warm Film**. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.

##### Step 4 Apply more graininess to the film

![apply more graininess to the film](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-5.jpg)

Please don't stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the **Overlay** menu under the Effects tab, then click **Old Film**. After that, choose the **Random Dust, Dirty Film,** and **Subtle Grain** effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.

## Summary

And that's all there is today! With these steps, you can create an engaging 1950s film without breaking a sweat on Filmora. Remember to visit our other vintage tutorials to learn how to create a film recorded in the 20s, 80s, and 90s. Happy editing, everyone!

## Wedding Videography Checklist

### 1\. Get to know the couple

As a wedding videographer, it's important to get to know the couple you're working with. This will help you better capture the essence of their wedding day. Spend time talking to them, learn about their relationship, and find out what is important to them. By doing this, you'll be able to create a video that truly reflects who they are as a couple.

### 2\. Understand your videography style and skill level

Wedding videography can be done in a variety of styles, depending on your skill level and interests. Some videographers prefer to stay in the background and capture everything as it happens, while others like to get more involved, interviewing the couple and capturing special moments. It's important to understand what style you feel comfortable working in, and what the couple is looking for in a video.

If you're just starting out, it might be a good idea to stick to a more traditional style of videography. This will help you get the hang of things and build your skills before trying something more adventurous. However, if you have a lot of experience and are confident in your abilities, you may want to try something more creative. Be sure to discuss your ideas with the couple beforehand and make sure they're on board with what you want to do.

### 3\. Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment

Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment. Some venues may have restrictions on where you can set up your gear. If this is the case, be sure to work out a plan with the venue beforehand so that there are no surprises on the day of the wedding.

### 4\. Find out what equipment is needed

To be a successful wedding videographer, you'll need some basic equipment. This includes a good-quality video camera, tripod, microphone, and lighting. It's also a good idea to have some editing software on hand in case you need to do any post-production work. Be sure to discuss your needs with the couple ahead of time and make sure they're comfortable with what you plan on bringing along to the wedding.

### 5\. Get insurance for yourself and your gear

If you're going to be a wedding videographer, it's important to have insurance for yourself and your gear. This will help protect you in the event of an accident or damage to your equipment. There are a number of companies that offer insurance specifically for photographers and videographers, so be sure to shop around and find the best deal for you.

### 6\. Ask for a shot list from the couple in advance

This will help you know what specific shots they are hoping to get on their wedding day. Be sure to discuss the shot list with the couple and make sure you're both on the same page.

### 7\. Alert guests of their wedding video presence

Some couples may want to keep their wedding video a surprise, while others will want to let their guests know in advance that they'll be filmed. If the latter is the case, it's important to alert guests of your presence so that they're not caught off guard by the cameras. Be sure to discuss this with the couple beforehand and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with.

### 8\. Recruit an assistant videographer if you need one

If you're going to be filming the wedding by yourself, it's important to make sure you have all the necessary gear. However, if you're not comfortable doing this or feel like you might need some help, consider recruiting an assistant videographer. This person can help carry gear, set up equipment, and make sure everything is running smoothly on the day of the wedding.

### 9\. Have some backups on hand, just in case

Wedding videography is a big responsibility, and things can sometimes go wrong. Be sure to have some backups on hand, just in case. This includes extra batteries, memory cards, and cables. It's better to be safe than sorry, and having these backups will give you peace of mind knowing that you're prepared for anything.

### 10\. Arrive early to set up and test your equipment

This will help ensure that everything is working properly and that you're familiar with your surroundings. It's also a good idea to do a sound check to make sure the audio is coming through clearly. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to set up and test your equipment before the wedding begins.

### 11\. Capture both the big and small moments

While it's important to capture the big moments, such as the ceremony and speeches, don't forget about the smaller ones as well. These can often be just as special, if not more so. Be sure to keep your camera rolling throughout the entire event so that you don't miss a thing.

### 12\. Have fun

Wedding videography can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. Be sure to enjoy yourself and have a good time while you're working. This will come through in your final product and the couple will be sure to appreciate it.

## BONUS: Important moments to capture on the wedding day

Spend time talking to them, learn about their relationship, and find out what is important to them. By doing this, you'll be able to create a video that truly reflects who they are as a couple.

### 2\. Understand your videography style and skill level

Wedding videography can be done in a variety of styles, depending on your skill level and interests. Some videographers prefer to stay in the background and capture everything as it happens, while others like to get more involved, interviewing the couple and capturing special moments. It's important to understand what style you feel comfortable working in, and what the couple is looking for in a video.

If you're just starting out, it might be a good idea to stick to a more traditional style of videography. This will help you get the hang of things and build your skills before trying something more adventurous. However, if you have a lot of experience and are confident in your abilities, you may want to try something more creative. Be sure to discuss your ideas with the couple beforehand and make sure they're on board with what you want to do.

### 3\. Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment

Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment. Some venues may have restrictions on where you can set up your gear. If this is the case, be sure to work out a plan with the venue beforehand so that there are no surprises on the day of the wedding.

### 4\. Find out what equipment is needed

To be a successful wedding videographer, you'll need some basic equipment. This includes a good-quality video camera, tripod, microphone, and lighting. It's also a good idea to have some editing software on hand in case you need to do any post-production work. Be sure to discuss your needs with the couple ahead of time and make sure they're comfortable with what you plan on bringing along to the wedding.

### 5\. Get insurance for yourself and your gear

If you're going to be a wedding videographer, it's important to have insurance for yourself and your gear. This will help protect you in the event of an accident or damage to your equipment. There are a number of companies that offer insurance specifically for photographers and videographers, so be sure to shop around and find the best deal for you.

### 6\. Ask for a shot list from the couple in advance

This will help you know what specific shots they are hoping to get on their wedding day. Be sure to discuss the shot list with the couple and make sure you're both on the same page.

### 7\. Alert guests of their wedding video presence

Some couples may want to keep their wedding video a surprise, while others will want to let their guests know in advance that they'll be filmed. If the latter is the case, it's important to alert guests of your presence so that they're not caught off guard by the cameras. Be sure to discuss this with the couple beforehand and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with.

### 8\. Recruit an assistant videographer if you need one

If you're going to be filming the wedding by yourself, it's important to make sure you have all the necessary gear. However, if you're not comfortable doing this or feel like you might need some help, consider recruiting an assistant videographer. This person can help carry gear, set up equipment, and make sure everything is running smoothly on the day of the wedding.

### 9\. Have some backups on hand, just in case

Wedding videography is a big responsibility, and things can sometimes go wrong. Be sure to have some backups on hand, just in case. This includes extra batteries, memory cards, and cables. It's better to be safe than sorry, and having these backups will give you peace of mind knowing that you're prepared for anything.

### 10\. Arrive early to set up and test your equipment

This will help ensure that everything is working properly and that you're familiar with your surroundings. It's also a good idea to do a sound check to make sure the audio is coming through clearly. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to set up and test your equipment before the wedding begins.

### 11\. Capture both the big and small moments

While it's important to capture the big moments, such as the ceremony and speeches, don't forget about the smaller ones as well. These can often be just as special, if not more so. Be sure to keep your camera rolling throughout the entire event so that you don't miss a thing.

### 12\. Have fun

Wedding videography can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. Be sure to enjoy yourself and have a good time while you're working. This will come through in your final product and the couple will be sure to appreciate it.

This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

#### Method 1: Using Chroma Key

**Step 1:** Start your project in Filmora and import two files in the timeline. Bring the background clip first in the timeline, then the original file. Cut the unnecessary portion of background-clip.

**Step 2:** Keep them selected and come to the "AI Tools" option in the right-side panel. Enable the "Chroma Key" toggle, and AI will automatically replace the background. You can use the “Tolerance,” “Edge Thickness,” and “Edge Feather” sliders for manual changes.

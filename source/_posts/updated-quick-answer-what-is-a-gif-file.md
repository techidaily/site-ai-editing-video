02 [Are GIF Files Subject to Copyright?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Convert a GIF File](#Part 3)

04 [6 Places to Find the Best Gifs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What Is a GIF File?

**GIF** is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format. Talking of the explicit **GIF meaning**, this one is a short motion snippet created from a set of serially arranged still images in a looping motion. Talking of the origin of GIFs, these were first introduced in 1987 by Steve Wilhite from the US based online service provider CompuServe, precisely on June 15.

**GIFs** serve as portable image formats for still and animated images, and are primarily small sized files. However, these are very well compatible with large content files too. In today’s times, GIFs are a trending means of entertainment based content sharing and intensified message delivery to target audience. Additionally, you can conveniently use motion images in the **GIF format** as effective tools of improvising and upgrading your marketing straggles for an enhanced brand promotion.

Considering the immense content varieties of GIFs, these are an eminent part of blogs, social media posts and product websites. You can even use them to objectify your emotions and feelings when conversing with peers through the latest instant messaging applications. The bottom line is, GIFs are an integral part of today’s modern and dynamic communication patterns and needs.

## Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?

The straight and simple answer to this query is a ‘Yes’. CIFs are indeed subject to copyright, just like its creative counterparts. These essentially constitute an original copyrighted creation, or may even originate from an existing copyright protected work. However, you may encounter potential glitches when choosing to work with **GIF images** while sticking with legal constraints.

Talking of the potential issues with the legality of GIF usage, there are two major concerns; the first being the sharing of unlicensed copyrighted GIF content, while the absence of legalized methods for licensed commercial use of these short motion clips being the second. Talking of possible reasons, there is again a duel. At present, there no copyright exercise from the end of original creators of GIF content, along with the absence of exact copyright claim constraints that can be imposed by content owners.

This scenario poses a potential need to look for suitable mitigation methods to curb copyright claims and disputes resulting from illegal use of GIFs. As a matter of fact, the development of a proper legal framework for undisputed GIF usage is a time consuming process. However, you can stay cautious by adhering to the following measures in the meantime:

**●** Refrain from using GIFs in a manner that would appear unsolicited to you, had you been the content owner.

**●** Take a note to credit the original creators in case3 you are using the GIF content from a known copyright source.

**●** Avoid drawing content from doubtful sources, instead search for trusted alternatives, or creating a GIF of your own would be an even better and safe choice.

## Part 3 How to Convert a GIF File

GIFs are an exciting means of creating a buzz about the information being conveyed. You can ensure an effective reach and impact of your brand if you include these catchy, short animation loops in your promotion strategy. Counting upon the credibility of GIFs, it is equally exciting to create these on your own. Try hands at experimenting with your creative skills to make and share interesting content through GIFs.

![add text behind objects by filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-1.png)

## Part 1\. What Are The Benefits of Adding Text Behind Objects in Videos?

Your videos must maintain quality to create content worthy of a huge audience. You may have a YouTube channel or be starting down the road. Then you must give this a try because

### Give a cool look

Adding text behind an object in a video looks cool! Now, your object could be a silhouette of a person or a huge skyscraper. You can add a text tile behind the object, creating the illusion. Due to this, the text will be flying in real-time.

### Show creativity

Blasting your channel with innovative and creative content is the key to building a big audience. But, of course, you can always opt for many ways to create a video showing your creativity. One of those ways is to add text behind your object.

You can create an attractive intro by adding text behind objects that captivate the viewer. It ensures that your subscribers stay tuned to your channel and your content.

### Build up a solid audience

Every day can be a real struggle if you are a daily content creator on YouTube. The audience demands good content. But your daily videos can get boring if you do not use new methods to edit your videos.

You can add text behind videos to spice up your intros and hook your daily audience even more. That will show the audience that you are genuinely putting in the effort.

Now there are a few things that you will need to add text behind videos. First, take a look at the basic priorities to perform this feature.

### 1\. A Static Object Video

Adding text behind an object can be tricky if the object isn't static. For example, the effect will be ruined if an object moves around a lot in a video.

##### Step2 Add the Video to the Timeline

We will first look at the static video example. For this, follow the below instructions:

* You have to start by importing your video in the import library.
* From the import library, you can click on the video and drag it down below to the timeline.

![adding video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.

* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

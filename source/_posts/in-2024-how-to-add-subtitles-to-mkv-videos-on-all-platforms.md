## How to Shoot Cinematic Footage with Phone

Creating cinematic videos is easy if you have expensive equipment like a film set with high-quality cameras. But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.

You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don't have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.

But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!

## Part 1\. What Is a Cinematic Video?

The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.

Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., **IMAX** cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.

With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.

Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!

## Part 2\. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video

To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:

### 1\. A Gimbal Stabilizer

When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.

If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.

A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the **Q3** Gimbal from **Zhiyun**.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-1.png)

You can also connect the Gimbal from its app. Scroll below to learn more about the app!

**Zhiyun Cami App**

**Zhiyun Q3** stabilizer also connects with the Zhiyun cami app. This app will allow users to access the filming features more intuitively and comprehensively. You can connect your Gimbal with the app via Bluetooth.

![zhiyun cami app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-2.png)

**Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes**

There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:

* **The Locking mode:** This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.
* **The POV mode** will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.

![the different modes of zhiyun q3 stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-3.png)

**Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer**

When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in **flashlight.**

This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal flashlight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-4.png)

You can also turn the flashlight towards yourself if you are recording a Vlog or taking a selfie. The light’s temperature is 4300K, giving a relatively warm light on the subject.

![spectrum of light indicating 4300k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-5.png)

### 2\. A Good Smartphone

Most smartphones these days are equipped with cameras with varying powers of recording. Some smartphone cameras focus on **Mega Pixels,** while others focus on the capture sensor. You need a smartphone camera that balances out all these qualities to record cinematic footage.

The recently released iPhone 14 pro camera is an excellent example of a good quality camera you can use to record cinematic videos.

![smartphone attached to gimbal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-6.png)

### 3\. Video Editing Software

There is no better software in the video editing field than the infamous Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to edit high-quality videos with creative features.

Wondershare Filmora allows access to the range of effects and filters you can apply to your videos to give them a more cinematic look. It also allows you to access the vast library of audio to utilize in your videos. Moreover, its engaging UI allows beginners to access to features of Wondershare Filmora easily.

![wondershare filmora website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-7.png)

Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.

## Part 3\. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone

You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.

Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.

* The Reveal Movement.
* The 180° Presentation Movement.
* The Following Movement.

First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.

### 1\. The Reveal Movement

This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.

The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.

To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:

* First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the **Gimbal**.
* **Align** your Smartphone camera behind the static object.
* Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.
* Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.

![the reveal movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-8.gif)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.

Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in **Locking mode**. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.

![gimbal fixed in locking mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-9.png)

### 2\. The 180° Presentation Movement

The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.

Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.

As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the **POV** **mode** of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.

![gimbal fixed in pov mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-10.png)

Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:

* First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.
* Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.
* When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.
* When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.

![the 180° presentation movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-11.gif)

By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”

### 3\. The Following Movement

You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.

The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.

![drawing a square to focus the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-12.png)

To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:

* When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.
* After that, open the **Cami** app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.
* Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.

![the following movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-13.gif)

This is how you will create the following movement.

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage.

![top video editor with useful masking - avid](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-6.jpg)

#### Masking in Avid Media Composer

In the Masking Effect window, you can choose to either create a new mask or use an existing one. First, select the "Create Mask" option and then click on the "Draw Mask" button to create a new mask.

This will open up the Draw Mask window, where you can draw your mask using the various tools provided. To apply the mask, simply click the "Apply" button.

If you want to use an existing mask, select the "Use Mask" option and then choose the mask you want to use from the drop-down menu.

### 5\. Sony Vegas Pro

Sony Vegas Pro is a professional video editing software with robust masking tools. The interface of the editor may looks complicated for beginners, yet once you get familiar with it, you will be amazed by what you can achieve with the Vegas Pro.

![top video editor with useful masking - sony vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-7.jpg)

#### Masking in Sony Vegas Pro

Step 1: Drag the clip from the Explorer or Project Media windows and drop it on the timeline. Then, look for another video that is quite distinct from the first.

Step 2: Drag it to the timeline below the first video event. A new track will be created. Place the original event directly beneath the video occurrence.

The Video Preview window does not display the second video because it is covered by the first video, which resembles one photo sitting on top of another in a stack. So to view the lower clip, we'll need to add a mask.

### 6\. Magix Movie Edit Pro

Magix Movie Edit Pro is another video editor that is great for adding masks to your video. It is famous for its ease-of-learn and stable rendering. When it comes to masking, it is also quite powerful.

![top video editor with useful masking - Magix Movie Edit Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-8.jpg)

#### Masking in Magix Movie Edit Pro

They let you apply special effects to only certain parts of a video. You may dramatically improve the aspect of your movies with this Magix Movie Edit Pro Plus feature.

When you apply color effects to the software's template, it appears that you can only use color effects.

To add additional effects to specific portions of the shot, simply import an image and apply the Alpha Mask property from the Chroma Key menu. Then you must duplicate the video section and place it on a lower track, while keeping the alpha mask picture in between the two videos (click the graphic above for a visual guide).

### 7\.  Studio

 Studio is a pro-level video editing software. It is preloaded with pro-caliber tool and premium effects to help you create the videos you want. We will show you how to apply masking in  Studio in the following paragraphs.

![top video editor with useful masking - <!-- Pinnacle --> Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-9.jpg)

#### Masking in  Studio

Select the clip you want to overlay your media on, then click the ‘Mask' button on the editing toolbar. After that, open the mask creation window by clicking ‘Create Mask.

First, click "Create Panel" to create a video mask panel.

To make a panel, use the panel of tools on the left side of the preview window. They'll only be shown in your video when you add assets later if they're inside this panel. Keep in mind that you may modify the size and placement of your asset within the panel and the panel itself; therefore, you might need to.

To access the media selection possibilities, click on the ‘Asset' tab of the mask creation window. To discover the picture or video you want to include in your panel, go through your imported files by selecting ‘Select media.' After that, select the media to be included in your panel video mask and hit ‘Apply.'

Use the left-hand slider or the resizing box in the preview window on the right to change the size and placement of your media in your panel video mask.

To adjust the 3D position of your panel video mask, go to the ‘3D' tab of the mask creation window.

### 8\. CyberLink PowerDirector

CyberLink PowerDirector has recently enhanced its mask & blend feature to help you create artistic scenes. If you are interested in the feature, you can try it out.

![top video editor with useful masking - cyberlink powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-10.jpg)

#### Masking in CyberLink PowerDirector

Drag and drop a photo from the media room into track 2 of your timeline, then drag the background image into track 1.

Then, go to the Quick Settings menu (press the Menu button at the bottom of your screen), select Cloud Print from the drop-down menu, and then select your photo. Then open up the design interface by selecting Mask Designer from the drop-down menu.

You may select from a variety of templates in the Mask Designer. If you want to make your own mask shape, the Mask Designer has three alternatives for you to create new mask types.

Create an image mask: You may use any picture or video, and it will be resized to fit the shape.

Create a text mask: Enter the text you'd like to appear in your photo. Then, go to the left side of the panel under Font/Paragraph on the left side for font style, size, and other options. To alter the text mask itself, go to the preview window and resize it on the left panel.

## Conclusion

**●** Maybe you want to add a picture-in-picture effect, or maybe you want to replace the background with a new image. Whatever the reason, it's easy to do with most video editing software. We've shown you how to mask videos in eight different editors in this article. So now you can get started creating your own custom videos!

* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.

* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.
* Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience.

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

As we all know, narration in a video is essential as it adds a character to your video. There are many options, like [AI voice text-to-speech](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) tools, to generate voiceovers. Regardless, do you know why voiceovers are considered beneficial in video editing? Let’s look ahead into some prominent benefits of using voiceovers:

### 1\. Narrative and Information

Voiceover provides a narrative element to a video. This further guides the viewers through the content and conveys important information. It also allows you to explain concepts, provide context, or tell a story to your engaged audience.

### 2\. Clarity and Comprehension

This also helps clarify complex concepts by providing a verbal explanation. It ensures that viewers can easily understand the message or purpose of the video. Even if the visuals alone are insufficient, text-to-speech generators can help. Moreover, voiceover adds an additional layer of information that can aid comprehension.

### 3\. Storytelling and Emotional Impact

It allows you to add emotions, tone, and personality to the video. Furthermore, it can set the mood to create a connection with the audience. A well-executed voiceover can also improve the storytelling aspect of the video. Similarly, people tend to memorize such videos which have an impactful speech or voice recording.

### 4\. Professionalism and Polishing

Including a voiceover in your video adds a level of professionalism and polish. It gives the impression that careful thought and planning went into the production. A high-quality voiceover with clear pronunciation allows the audience to understand the topic better. Moreover, proper timing and appropriate intonation also polish the video content.

### 5\. Localization and Accessibility

Speech-to-text software can easily translate and localize into different languages. This function of voiceovers can make the video accessible to a wider audience. By generating voiceovers in different languages, you can help you reach international viewers. Similarly, it expands your audience and increases the video's potential impact.

### 6\. Flexibility and Flexibility

Another benefit of voiceover is that it provides flexibility during the editing process. You can record it separately and edit and improve it to fit the visuals precisely. This allows you to refine the narration, adjust the pacing, and ensure synchronization. Additionally, it also provides flexibility in terms of making changes or updates to the script.

### 7\. Reducing Noise and Distractions

Lastly, voiceover allows you to reduce or eliminate background noise and even unwanted sounds. You can also enhance the audio quality and eliminate distractions from your video. Meanwhile, the elimination of such elements also improves the overall viewer experience.

## Green Screen Is a Widely Used Effect in After Effects. Many Professional Photographers Use It to Make Creative Video Effects. This Guide Will Show You How to Use Green Screen to Videos in After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

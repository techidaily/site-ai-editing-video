## Part 1 How to Create a Custom Slide Show in PowerPoint?

PowerPoint presentations are an already elusive and captivating media of information delivery and content sharing, be it a personal entertainment need or a high end professional requirement, PowerPoint presentations can do it all! Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.

Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.

Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the **custom slide show** creation process with the finest details:

**User's Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint**

Start the **custom slide show PowerPoint** creation process with launching the PowerPoint tool in any of your preferred devices. It would be better to work on a desktop or a PC. Proceed to open the presentation that you wish to create a custom slideshow from.

**Step 2: Custom Slide Show Option**

In the welcome interface of PowerPoint, navigate to the ribbon at the top and hit the ‘Slide Show' tab, followed by clicking on the ‘Custom Slide Show' button from the ‘Options Panel' that appears.

The software was originally designed for professional filmmakers, but it's now available for anyone to use for any type of project. You can download Lightworks from the website here - <https://www.lightworks.com/>

## Downloading the Software

First, download the Lightworks software from the website. You can do this by clicking on the big green button that says "Download the Latest Version". When you click on it, you'll be prompted to select your operating system and download the appropriate package.

Click "Next" and you'll see a license agreement and a prompt for installation details. Fill in your information and click "Next" again to start your installation.

When installation is complete, launch Lightworks by double-clicking on the Lightworks icon in your files section.

The first time you open Lightworks, you'll need to go through a few steps of initializing before using it for editing videos. This includes setting up your project settings and choosing whether or not to keep a backup of your previous work.

We will cover these initial steps separately in future blog posts, so don't worry if it's all unclear right now!

## The Interface

New users to the software will notice that there are four different windows. The first window is the Project window. This window shows you all of the footage you have loaded into your project, as well as any clips you've added to your project (see below) and edits you've made. You may also notice a timeline in this window; this is where you'll be placing your clips to create your video.

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-1.png)

The Toolbar is located at the top of all four windows and gives quick access to commonly used features like adding clips, cropping, cutting clips, and more.

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-2.png)

The Edit List Window displays all of the clips that are available for use in your Project Window or Timeline. They're not ordered chronologically; they're ordered by how they were imported into Lightworks.

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-3.png)

The Timeline Window displays a list of edited scenes from your edited project for viewing purposes only - it does not contain anything about editing or timeline manipulation tasks.

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-4.png)

The Monitor Window displays information about what's being displayed on screen at any given time. It can be used to preview videos before exporting them, previous scenes from the timeline, or rendered video frames after applying render effects.

## Step by Step in Cutting Videos in Lightworks

It's not difficult to cut or divide a clip in Lightworks, and it doesn't require a lot of time or effort. The following are the simple actions you'll need to do to get started:

Step 1: First and foremost, you must import your movie into Lightworks. The simplest way to do this is to drag the clip you wish to work with onto the timeline:

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-6.png)

Step 2: After you've uploaded your clips to the timeline, you'll be able to begin trimming them. To do so, simply slide the play head to the point where you wish to cut the clip and press the "C" key on your keyboard:

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-7.png)

Step 3: After you've cut the part you need, you'll need to erase the rest. To do so, use your mouse to select the part you don't want to erase, then use your mouse to pick the "Delete" option, or just click the "delete" button on your keyboard:

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-8.png)

Step 4: When you're finished, right-click the "ALL" option in the lower-left corner of the Timeline and select "Export" from the menu that appears:

## Step by Step to Rotate Videos in Windows Media Player

Video Editing and the emotion the final product evokes is dependent on many aspects, be it the source clips, the cuts introduced or the way of presentation. But to get to the end, there are several steps involved in the production process, and not every instance of it is perfect. But we all know, editing does often help iron out any kinks, with its ability to solve basic problems, like footage that is askew, or upside down. Thus with the steps listed in this article we will help you understand how you can rotate videos to ensure your edited project looks as intended.

This particular article considers the pre-installed Windows Media Player and WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with Windows Media Player_ _(on a device running Windows 10_ _) and WonderShare Filmora._

## How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?

Imagine you’re in a situation where you have gone ahead and finished the filming portion of a project on your smartphone but realise that the capture footage is upside down. Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.

Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, _you will not be able to rotate the clip_. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.

Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.

### **TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER**

In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.

While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.

To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.

* Click on Organize.
* Then move onto Manage Libraries
* Now click on Videos.

You can also explore different ideas to make your video unique and engaging.

![graphical text of initial ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-initial-ideas.jpg)

##### Step1Research and gather information

You can begin by researching and gathering information from other music videos. This will help you to know what has been done before and what is currently popular. You can also figure out how you can do it differently.

##### Step2Brainstorm and concept development

Once you understand the current trends and styles in the music video. It's time to start brainstorming ideas. You can do it alone or with the help of your team. But remember that you have to think out of the box to make it creative.

##### Step3Consider the lyrics and message

In the planning stage, it is also important to consider the lyrics and message of the song. It would be best if you plan according to the feel and vibe of the song. It will help you to create a concept tied to the song and will help enhance its meaning.

##### Step4Experiment and find the right direction

Once you have a general concept, it's time to develop it further. You can do it by creating rough sketches or storyboards. You can also film test footage to see how the concept will look on screen.

##### Step5Effort and attention to detail

Remember, this step is the foundation of your music video. So, take your time and don't rush through it. By putting in effort and attention to detail, you'll be able to create a visually stunning and closely tied to the song's music video.

## Choose a style for your music video

While creating ideas for the music video, it's also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:

![types of music video style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/types-of-music-video-style.jpg)

### 1.Performance-style music video

If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.

### 2.Narrative-style music video

A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.

You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.

Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.

![treatment of the plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/treatment-of-the-plan.jpg)

## Storyboard your music video

Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding! It allows you to break down your music video visually and highlight key visual moments. It can save time and money and convey a clear idea to the team. You can do this on paper, a computer, or a tablet, whatever works best for you.

##### Step4Drop your media onto the timeline

Drag and drop the song to the audio timeline. Then press shift, select all images, and drop them into the picture timeline. If you realize you are missing enough clips to complete the song, you can draw and add more shots.

##### Step5Adjust the frame

You can right-click on the picture's timeline and select **Crop to fit** to adjust the image on the screen. You can also adjust the scenes according to the song.

##### Step6Add effects

You can also simulate transitions and effects in the clips. Let's suppose you want to show a zoom-in shot. Then you would click on the picture frame and the keyframe option just above the timeline. Now keyframe the position and scale of the clip according to you.

Once you feel like your clips sync with the song, you are ready to start planning for the production of your music video.

## Conclusion

We hope this blog has given you a better understanding of how planning and storyboarding can help make your music videos better. You can ensure that your vision is clearly communicated to the audience by planning and storyboarding your music videos properly. Now that you know what to do, it's time to put that knowledge into action. Take a pencil and paper and start sketching the shots and scenes you want to create.

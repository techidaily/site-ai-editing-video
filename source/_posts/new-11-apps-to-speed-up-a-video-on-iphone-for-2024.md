**_Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?_**

It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.

But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.

**FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:**

1. **Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?**

Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn't feel jumpy.

It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.

1. **Q) How to do Speed Ramping?**

Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn't support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.

1. **Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?**

Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.

1. **Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?**

Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.

Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.

**\~Cons:**

* Its UI doesn't support editing in landscape orientation.
* It doesn't support 4k video resolution.

**_Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?_**

It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.

But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.

**FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:**

1. **Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?**

Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn't feel jumpy.

It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.

1. **Q) How to do Speed Ramping?**

Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn't support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.

1. **Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?**

Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.

1. **Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?**

Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.

Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.

* Its UI doesn't support editing in landscape orientation.

**_Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?_**

It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.

But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.

**FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:**

1. **Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?**

Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn't feel jumpy.

It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.

1. **Q) How to do Speed Ramping?**

Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn't support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.

1. **Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?**

Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.

1. **Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?**

Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.

Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.

**\~Cons:**

* Its UI doesn't support editing in landscape orientation.

**_Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?_**

It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.

But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.

**FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:**

1. **Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?**

Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn't feel jumpy.

It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.

1. **Q) How to do Speed Ramping?**

Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn't support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.

1. **Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?**

Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.

1. **Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?**

Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.

Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.

## Easy Guide to Zoom Video in VLC

Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.

You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.

## Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom

VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.

Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.

Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.

Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.

Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg)

Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg)

Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.

## Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu

Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.

Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.

Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-vlc-zoom-options.jpg)

Otherwise, you can press Shift + Z keys together to try out different zoom options.

## Part 3: Zoom VLC Video Using Magnifier

If you are using VLC Media Player on your Windows desktop computer, you can use the inbuilt Magnifier tool to zoom into a video that you are playing on VLC. You can zoom into videos to read any text in the background but this leads to low resolution and distortion. You can zoom in by 16 times which is the highest among all the three methods. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom video using Magnifier tool.

Step1Open VLC Player and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Start menu on Windows and search for “Magnifier”.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-vlc-video-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Click on Magnifier App. Once it opens, place the mouse pointer on the video and you will see its magnified version.

**1\. Create folders in Filmora**

If you have footage from multiple cameras, it is best to create some folders first.

##### Step1 Create a Folder for Camera 1

If you have video footage from three cameras, you can create one folder for each camera.

Go to the default folder on the top left and rename it Cam\_A.

![create a folder for camera 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_1.jpg)

##### Step2 Create a Folder for Camera 2

Then go to the bottom left of the media browser and click on this icon to add a new folder. Rename it to Cam\_B.

![create a folder for camera 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_2.jpg)

##### Step3 Create a Folder for Camera 3

Repeat the steps to create another folder called Cam\_C. Now you can import footage from your different cameras into each folder.

![create a folder for camera 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_3.jpg)

##### Step4 Create a Folder for Production Sound

After that, add three new folders and rename them to Production Sound, SFX, and Music. Production sound is usually the sound that is recorded on set. If you have recorded all dialects from the subjects on the location, you can put them into this folder.

![create a folder for production sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_4.jpg)

##### Step5 Create a Folder for SFX

SFX stands for sound effects. You can add push clapping, laughing and other Folly sounds into this folder.

![create a folder for sfx](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_5.jpg)

##### Step6 Create a Folder for Music

Next, import all music files into the music folder. You can create folders for your graphics, B-roll, and stock footage if needed.

![create a folder for music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_6.jpg)

**2\. Organize your Timeline and Video Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing

Keep the first three tracks for picture editing. These tracks are usually for picture editing that includes footage with no effects or some simple effects—for example resizing, keyframing, transitions, or Green Screen.

![create tracks for picture editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_7.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Temporary Footage

Set up the fourth track for the temporary footage or placeholders so you can quickly switch the temporary footage without spending extra time looking for them.

![create tracks for temporary footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_8.jpg)

##### Step3 Create Tracks for Effects

Set the fifth video track as the effect track. It will include all effects from firmware that do not apply to the footage directly.

![create tracks for effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_9.jpg)

##### Step4 Create Tracks for On and Off Content

Next, on the sixth video track, you can add the content that you would want to turn on and off from time to time. In this example, you can put the subtitles here.

![create tracks for on and off content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_10.jpg)

**3\. Organize your Audio Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects

The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.

![create tracks for dialects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_11.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Additional Audio

The third audio track could be for any additional audio, such as voiceover. If you don't have a voiceover in your video, you can leave it empty.

![create tracks for additional audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_12.jpg)

##### Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects

The fourth track could usually be the sound effects track. You can add all the clapping sounds, laughing, and all kinds of other foley sound here.

![create tracks for sound effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_13.jpg)

##### Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound

Keep the fifth track for Ambient sound and room tone. You can use it to keep a very subtle environment sound in specific scenes. For example, you can use the room tone recorded on sets.

![create tracks for ambient sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_14.jpg)

##### Step5 Create Tracks for Background Music

Finally, the sixth track is usually for background music. But, of course, you could also keep it empty if your project has no background music.

![create tracks for background music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_15.jpg)

**4\. Color Code Your Clips**

Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.

![color code your clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg)

## Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency

**1\. Rename Individual Clips**

It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.

**2\. Remove Empty Timeline**

For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select "Delete Empty Tracks" from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.

**3\. Use Keyboard Shortcuts**

Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.

**4\. Select Good Music**

Don't only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you're making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.

**5\. Add Text and Graphics**

Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.

## Summary

You don't need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it's easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.

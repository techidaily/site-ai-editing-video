## How to Change the Speed of Video in DaVinci Resolve?

Slow-motion videos are in trend on social media platforms. You can shoot the footage in slow-motion mode or slow it down while editing the video. Similarly, if you are making a funny video, there are surely going to be parts where the video speeds up. Sped-up video clips have always been part of comic relief and entertainment for the audience. You will need a feature-rich video editor to customize the speed of your video.

DaVinci Resolve has established itself as a complete video editor. You can edit your video, correct the color, add visual effects and edit audio parts. You can undoubtedly change video speed in DaVinci Resolve. However, DaVinci Resolve's user interface is slightly complex for beginners. We will instruct on how you can speed up a video using DaVinci Resolve. We will also suggest you an easier alternative if you are not in favor of DaVinci Resolve.

## Part I. What are the Scenarios When You Need to Speed Up Video?

There are several scenarios when speeding up a video becomes a necessity. Here are the most probable ones that you can relate to.

**Boring But Necessary Parts** \- There could be some sections in a long video that are necessary but boring to watch. You can't bore your viewers and let them leave your video midway. Hence, you can speed up those sections to pass them away quickly.

**Funny Videos** \- The subject's actions in the video look very funny when you speed them up. Therefore, if you make funny videos to entertain your viewers, speeding up certain sections of your video with funny audio in the background should be a regular thing.

**Short Videos** \- Short-duration videos are extremely popular on social media platforms.

People upload them as Stories and Statuses to entertain their followers regularly. Therefore, a sped-up video can shorten the duration, accommodate the necessary content, and fit the video duration requirements of the respective social media platforms.

**Timelapse** \- Timelapse videos are a treat to watch. You can shoot the video in timelapse mode or speed up the video while editing. That is how you can fit hours of a video into a few minutes or seconds of video duration.

## Part II. Speed Up Video using DaVinci Resolve

DaVinci Resolve is a professional video editor where you can change your video's speed in several ways. You can instantly change your video clip's speed by mentioning the speed in terms of percentage.

You can also use the advanced Speed Ramp option to customize the video speed unevenly. Besides, there are retime curves to adjust the video speed at your convenience. Let us go through the detailed guide on how to speed up the video in DaVinci Resolve 17.

### Method 1\. Change Clip Speed Option

The simplest way is through the Change Clip Speed option. You can explicitly mention the speed percentage as needed. To speed it up, mention speed percentage above 100\. If you want to slow it down, the speed percentage will be below 100\. Here are the steps you need to execute.

Step1 After you have placed the video clip onto the timeline, select the clip and right-click on it.

![placed the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

Step2 Tap "Change Clip Speed…" option.

![change clip speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-2.jpg)

Step3 Once the Change Clip Speed dialog box opens, modify the speed from 100% to something higher if you want to speed it up.

![once the change clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

Step4 Click on the Change button when you are happy with the result.

### Method 2\. Speed Ramping Option

Speed ramping is a process where you can vary the speed of your video unevenly. It means you can speed up some portions while slowing down others. This is achieved through retime controls that let you edit the video clips in sections using speed points. Here are the steps to illustrate the process.

Step1 Right-click the video clip on your timeline. From the menu, select the Retime Controls option.

![video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

Step2 Move the play head where you want to change the speed. Click the arrow next to 100% and select the Add Speed Point option. Similarly, move the play head to another point and add a new speed point.

![change the speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-5.jpg)

Step3 Click on the arrow next to 100% to change the speed between two-speed points. Go to the Change Speed option and select from the preset. Based on your preset speed selection, the video's speed within the speed points will change.

## Part III. Pros and Cons

Every video editor has its advantages as well as drawbacks. So if you think about changing video speed through DaVinci Resolve, check its pros and cons.

 Pros

* Change the speed of the entire video clip instantly.
* Change the speed of certain sections of the video through speed ramping.
* Vary the speed of the video clip unevenly with Retime curves.
* Change video speed with Optical Flow for better motion representation.

 Cons

* There are too many options to change video speed.
* The regular video speed-changing options produce jittery results.

## Blender Green Screen Effects

Blender is an open-source cross-platform 3D graphics program, but this doesn’t mean it’s a low-rent option. Just like commercial packages like Lightwave 3D, it is also a very capable compositing package. Unlike Lightwave, it is a modern node-based compositor like Nuke or Fusion. It’s not what the software is designed for, but it does a bangup job of green screen compositing, as you will soon see.

Blender green screen uses technique of the ****chroma key** a color is isolated (in our case the green of the****green screen**), or a particular luminance, it is removed and the area that was occupied by it becomes transparent, thus becoming part of the alpha channel. The transparent parts will thus show the video or the image below, which will thus define the environment in which the subject of the first movie will act.

## How to Use Green Screen in Blender

So we need to pull these two elements into Blender and pull a key on the green bits to make the background show through in as naturalistic a way as possible. Blender is a node-based compositor which means the control mechanism is nodes or little LEGO blocks of love which you place on the screen and link with little strings which form your signal path.

![blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-interface.jpg)

Locate the drop-down (it goes up, actually, but you know what we mean) at the bottom of the view, and select “Movie Clip Editor.”

Click the “Open” button and choose and load your green screen footage. (You can also load sequences of images for uncompressed keys in this step if you have the space, and the footage is the right size.)

Once the clip is loaded, go back to the drop-down and select Node Editor.

The screen will be blank, but just go to the bottom of the view and click the middle button marked “Node Tree Type” to Display, and then check the Use Nodes and Backdrop buttons.

Select the “Render Layers” node, and because we won’t need it you can delete it (on the Mac this is the Forward Delete key). Then move the Compositing node out of the way because we won’t need it yet.

****Note:** to zoom in and out of the nodes, use the centre scroll wheel of the mouse if you have it. To zoom in and out of the images you are working on, use the V and Alt-V keys.

****Compositing Nodes**

Click the Add menu in the bar at the bottom of the view and select “Input -> Movie Clip.” Select the green screen clip you added in the Movie Clip Editor. This is the input. We have to push this through a keyer to remove the green and make those areas transparent.

****Important:** in this program flow goes from left to right, so node inputs are on the left of a node, and outputs are on the right of a node.

Now select “Add -> Matte -> Keying” to add a keying node. Also “Add -> Output -> Viewer” to make the output from the key visible. Click on the little yellow dot next to Image output on the Input node, and drag it to Image input on the Keying node. Then drag the little dot next to Image output on the keying node, and drag it to the image input on the viewer node.

You now have to select the key colour, the colour which the keyer is changing to transparent. Click the Key Colour button on the Keying node, and this displays a colour selector. Click the eyedropper, and click on the image in the background somewhere on the green screen.

If you look carefully, you will see that there are some areas which still have a bit of colour and are not fully transparent. You can check this more accurately by dragging the string from the Matte output on the Keying node and linking to the input on the viewer. This is the key you have made. As you can see, the dark bits are supposed to be totally black, and there are still greys showing through. (This is because the source material wasn’t perfect.)

There are many different ways to fix this depending on the shot, but if it’s a reasonably well-shot green screen, all you will need to do is the following.

Adjust the Black Clip slider to expand the amount of greens which turn to black. Then adjust the White Clip to push the whites to prevent them from becoming transparent.

Once you have pure white and pure black, reconnect the image output of the keying node to the image input on the viewer, and you’ll see you have a decent key.

You can adjust the amount of fringing and spill (reflections from the green screen on the model), but generally the keyer does a good job of guessing that for you with a decently-shot green screen.

****Adding the background**

After this, adding the background is more of the same with a slight twist. “Add -> Input -> Movie Clip,” navigate to your background clip and load it.

To blend the two layers, you have to make a mix of the two clips so that the background shows through the now transparent bits of the foreground.

“Add -> Colour -> Mix node”. Take the output from the background clip, and feed it to the top image input of the mix node. Take the output from the keying node, and feed it into the lower image input on the mix node.

Click the Alpha channel button next to the drop-down on the mix node.

And finally we have our key. The background is way too sharp and makes the green screen footage look really soft and crappy, so we need to soften the background. There is a really nice Bokeh Blur filter in blender for just this purpose to make the background look out of focus and add lots of gorgeous Bokeh blobs.

“Add -> Filter -> Bokeh Blur” and put it between the background clip and the mix. In Blender, if you add a node and place it over a string between two nodes, the string goes yellow, and dropping it will automatically insert the new node into the signal path connecting inputs and outputs.

Finally add an image to the Bokeh Blur for the shape you want the bokeh to be; we opted for a donut-shaped iris pattern.

To render out your video, connect the output of the Mix node to the input of the compositing node we left lying about earlier. It’s okay for this output to be connected to the input node of the viewer, too, as this means we see progress while rendering.

Make sure you are set up to render the right amount of frames at 30fps in the render panel on the far right. 30fps for 5 seconds (the duration of our clip) is 150 frames. Insert 150 where it says End Fr.

Select a place and a filename to output to in the Output panel further down the right-hand side. Then to render, select the info menu bar from the top-left drop-down, and finally choose “Render Menu -> Render Animation,” and the render will begin.

**How do I get rid of the green screen in blender?**

This is achieved by Compositing Nodes: Click the Add menu in the bar at the bottom of the view and select “Input -> Movie Clip.” Select the green screen clip you added in the Movie Clip Editor. This is the input. We have to push this through a keyer to remove the green and make those areas transparent.

**How do I get rid of objects in green screen?**

This can be done by following these prompts: Select “Add -> Matte -> Keying” to add a keying node. Also “Add -> Output -> Viewer” to make the output from the key visible. Click on the little yellow dot next to Image output on the Input node, and drag it to Image input on the Keying node. Then drag the little dot next to Image output on the keying node, and drag it to the image input on the viewer node.

## Conclusion

Obviously, to get the best green screen composites you have to shoot good “plates.” “Plates” are the main bits of the shot that you bolt together in movie visual effects. You have the foreground plate and the green screen bit with an actor filmed in front of a green screen. Then you have the background plate which is the bit you want to show through the green bits of the foreground, making the whole thing look as though the background and foreground were filmed at the same time.

## Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video

Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don't need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.

**●** **Tell a story**

Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.

**●** **Keep it cohesive**

The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.

**●** **Make it personal**

Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.

**●** **Keep slideshow videos short**

There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.

**●** **Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video**

As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.

The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.

**●** **Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly**

Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** is an effective tool which can help you to create wonderful video slideshows.

Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.

**●** **Tell a story**

Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.

**●** **Keep it cohesive**

The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.

**●** **Make it personal**

Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.

**●** **Keep slideshow videos short**

There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.

**●** **Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video**

As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.

The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.

**●** **Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly**

Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.

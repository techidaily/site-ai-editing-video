## Part 1 What Is a GIF and When to Use a GIF?

It is essential that we discuss what a GIF is? Firstly, GIF is the abbreviation for Graphics Interchange Format. Steve Wilhite, an American computer scantiest, was responsible for developing this bitmap image format with the team at the online services provider CompuServe.

The GIFs are images and animations whose sizes are reduced. The animations are much shorter in duration than the regular animation videos. It makes the animations look more expressive. The message, information, or expression to be portrayed through the animation gets better expressed due to its speed.

Therefore, the GIFs’ animations are much more exciting and engaging. A question might arise t you: Why should you use GIFs in slideshows, or how can they be beneficial. Let us put forth some benefits of GIFs that will help you know and understand their importance. Here are the benefits of using Gifs.

Additionally, each GIF has its characteristic features different from the others. Each of them is interesting and engaging in their way. So, you always have the chance of being better than the rest when you use GIFs in slideshows.

**●** Use them in the first slide as a title slide. Whenever you use a GIF in the first or the introductory slide, you automatically initiate your presentation with something unique. And as a result, you successfully grab the audience’ leave a good impression. Additionally, from the first slide itself, you tend to have a comfortable and positive environment to continue your presentation more impeccably.

Ensure not to use URL GIFs that can face you with copyright issues.

**●** You can also use the screengrabs; you can easily pull the attention of your audience to different parts of your content, one after the another, most systematically and effectively. As a result, you can explain and express your content in the most detailed way possible.

**●** Either type of GIF that you can use are charts and graphs. In the first place, putting graphs and charts tend to make your presentation more organised, factual and professional. So, when you include GIFs of charts and graphs, you take the beneficial qualities of your display a notch higher.

## 2 Ways to Fade in Text in Premiere Pro

Every video is unappealing until you edit the video properly. Editing videos not only means trimming out unnecessary parts but also adding effects and animations. There are certain effects and transitions that are commonly used in most videos. Fade in effect is widely used in texts, objects, as well as clips. Fade in effect is very eye-soothing that does not distract the audience from the overall video content.

Fade in effect is available in all video editors. Among video editors, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the best professional video editors. However, the learning curve of Premiere Pro is steep and hence, you have to know the exact steps to add fade in text Premiere Pro. We will illustrate how to apply fade in text effect Pro as well as add fade in and fade out transition effects in Premiere Pro. We will also state an alternative way to fade in texts in your videos.

## Part 1\. Fade in text in Premiere Pro with Opacity option

If you have added any text or any graphical object in your video on Premiere Pro, you can apply fade in effect to your text and object easily. When you add fade in effect to your text or object, they slowly appear on the screen which is very soothing to watch instead of sudden and abrupt appearance. Here are the steps on how to fade text in Premiere Pro.

Step1 You must have your video clip as well as text clip on the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Make sure that you add text from Essential Graphics panel. Select the text clip from the Timeline to proceed.

![select text sample pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-text-sample-pr.jpg)

Step2 Go to Effect Controls and click on Text option to expand it. Click on Opacity option from the dropdown menu.

![make opacity to 100 pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-opacity-to-100-pr.jpg)

Step5 Play the video to watch the fade in effect on your selected text. You can move the keyframes to speed up or slow down fade in effect.

## Part 2\. Make fade in or out with transition effects

If you have multiple video clips or scenes, you should add fade in and fade out transition effects so that the transition from one clip to another or one scene to another is smooth. The fade in or fade out effect for video clips look similar to fade text Premiere Pro. In fact, you can use the steps of how to fade in text in Premiere Pro to get the job done. But there is an easier way available with Video Transitions option. Here are the steps on how to apply fade in or out effect on your video clips in Premiere Pro.

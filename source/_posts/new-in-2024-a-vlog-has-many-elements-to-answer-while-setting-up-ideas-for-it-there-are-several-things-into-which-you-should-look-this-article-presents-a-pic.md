**●** **Arranging Shots -** A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.

**●** **Saving Money -** Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client.

For example: Panel\_7\_New\_New\_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name\_ Script#\_Scene\_Frame\_01.JPG

### 05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?

Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them "OTS 1" and "OTS 2" with the corresponding dialogues.

YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.

YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.

Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.

### 04"Up Next" Feature

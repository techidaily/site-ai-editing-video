## Part 3\. Video transitions tips and tricks

If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.

**Consistency** – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.

**Experiment** – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.

**Out of the Box** – The reason you recommended [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects.

You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.

**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.

**Meaningful** – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate.

Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.

Both Final Cut Pro and Motion have an option to install Color Finale 2 as a video effect filter, known as a plug-in. It also installs a separate Color Finale application, which is necessary for the program to function properly within the framework of macOS. This application is only used to check for and apply updates to Color Finale 2, therefore the user will not ordinarily need to access it. The Color Finale 2 effect can be applied to any video clip, compound clip, title, generator, or adjustment layer (title effect) on the timeline by dragging and dropping the Color Finale 2 or Color Finale 2 Pro\*\* effect from the effects panel in Final Cut Pro.

The interface of Color Finale 2 is split into two sections: a control panel that can be found in the Final Cut Pro inspector and a layer editing panel that can be moved around and resized. These panels make use of a design language for the interface that is similar to that of Final Cut Pro. Both have contextual pulldown pickers and contextual menus, in addition to return arrows that are located next to the majority of the parameters in order to reset their values to the default (identified by three vertical dots).

## What is OBS?

Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is free and open-source software that allows users to record videos and live stream events right at their comfort. The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.

Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) is free and open-source software that allows users to record videos and live stream events right at their comfort. The software functions effectively on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.

Since its initial launch in 2012, OBS has made tremendous moves – This is not only from the constant release of its new versions but also the relentless increase in the functionality features. Besides, OBS is equipped with a robust API that enables plugins and scripts which provide extensive customization to precisely suit one’s needs.

However, OBS being a free application can function to date due to enough support from sponsors and backers.

## How to Apply Color Correction in OBS

When you carry out basic edits to your videos or images with OBS and realize that your project has poor shade, color, or tone, you don’t have to export it to another software to correct it. Instead, you can use filters for color correction in OBS.

Apart from using OBS filters to color correct video clips and images, you can correct games, browser sources, and video capture devices.

There are various aspects of color correction in OBS. It includes:

#### 1\. Gamma

Gamma is a fundamental aspect in OBS that functions by balancing the brightness of an image through contrast. To be precise, Gamma works almost similarly to change in brightness while simultaneously increasing or decreasing the contrast.

In editing, Gamma is applicable mainly for removing shiny foreheads and webcam footage in gaming and browsing.

High Gamma is represented by “L,” whereas low Gamm is represented by “R.”

#### 2\. Contrast

Contrast is the difference in the degree of colors and tones in an image. Usually, the low contrast image has a narrow color range, whereas the high contrast images have dark shadows and bright highlights.

“L” represents high contrast in OBS contrast, whereas “R” represents low contrast.

#### 3\. Brightness

Brightness is the degree to how light or dark a picture is. To be able to understand an image clearly, it is best to correct its brightness. A change in brightness of a picture has a simultaneous change in pixels of that image.

High brightness in OBS is denounced by the letter “L,” whereas Low brightness is denounced by “R.”

#### 4\. Saturation

Saturation is the intensity of colors in a video or an image. High saturated images are bright, strong, and are rich, whereas the low saturated photos appear washed out. Black and white (grayscale) photos have no color saturation. In OBS, high saturation and low saturation are represented as “L” and “R.”

#### 5\. Hue Shift

Hue shift is the change in an image’s saturation, lightness, and hue colors. Hue shifting occurs when highlighting or shading images. In OBS, you can use the hue shift functionality to reimage your image with a completely different color palette.

With the hue shift functionality in OBS, you can place the image on top of another and have an 80% opacity. It means that you will still see the first image when you place the second one on top of it.

The “L” sign in the OBS hue shift represents 50% opacity, while the “R” represents 100% Opacity.

## Color Grade in OBS

Color grading is the process of enhancing the appearance of an image through attributes such as contrast, saturation, and color, making them enchanting for presentations. Color grading is not only done for still images but also for motion pictures and images.

Color grading functionality in OBS is encompassed with several tools – This includes:

#### 1\. Lift tool

As the name suggests, lift tools are used in lifting or removing specific colors from an image. It does so without necessarily affecting other colors in an image.

With this tool, you can selectively remove unwanted colors from your image or video, replace them with your desired ones, and create astonishing results.

#### 2\. Offset

Offset is another outstanding tool in OBS color grading that controls the blacks/Shadows of an image. It functions by altering the brightness levels and leaving the highlights and the mid-tones unaffected.

#### 3\. Gain

A gain is a tool in OBS color correction that functions by only adjusting the white levels in an image. With the gain tool, brighter colors become brighter or darker.

Many people, especially beginner editors, experience difficulty differentiating between the Gamma and Offset tools. Yes, there is a closer similarity between the two, and for you to be on the safe side, you need to know that Gamma goes with the mid-tones (middle gray levels) whereas the Gain goes with highlights/whites.

## How to Apply LUTs in OBS

Look up tables (LUTs) is a functionality feature that allows editors, colorists, and filmmakers to save certain colors as their templates. Therefore, when working on a particular project, they don’t have to create new working color grades; instead, you pick it from your LUT.

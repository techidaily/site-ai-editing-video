## Create the Night-to-Day Effect Videos

Do you wish you could control when it's nighttime to daytime? It would make getting ready in the morning much faster! This tutorial will show you how to use the keyframe and mask feature in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make a remarkable night-to-day transition.

## How-to Guide

**_1) Preparation_**

For this effect, you will need to shoot two footage shots with the same frame. The first is for the daytime clip, and the second is for nighttime.

But before that, you need to prepare some things, such as:

1. Tripod to ensure your camera stays at the same point, so the frame doesn't change.
2. Mark the place where you want to shoot the scene. You can put a marker on the floor to ensure that you perform at the same spot in different shots.

Once done, let's start shooting to get the footage.

**_2) Steps_**

**Shooting footages**

First, get the daytime shot. For this tutorial, we will pretend that you are walking and transitioning into nighttime at the spot you have marked.

![get the daytime shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-1.gif)

Now, let's film the nighttime clip. You will walk through the living room and do the same movement again at the same spot. You can dim the light and change the camera's white balance settings to bluer to create a night feeling.

![film the nighttime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-2.gif)

After you have both clips that you need, let's go to Filmora and start editing.

**Night-to-day transition**

Step1 Launch Filmora and import the footage into the program. If you haven't installed it, you can download Filmora on their website here: <https://filmora.wondershare.com>

Step2 Place the nighttime video clip on the first video track of the timeline and place the daytime clip on the top.

![place the daytime clip on the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-3.jpg)

Step3 Find the spot where you want to create a transition between the day and nighttime. Then, you can delete the unwanted part.

![create a transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-4.jpg)

Step4 Since the transition for this tutorial is where the subject started waving, make sure to place the daytime clip at the same time the subject started waving in the nighttime clip. Hence, the timing in both clips syncs.

**Masking transition**

For the next step, we will make a masking transition with the Filmora mask feature.

Step1 Double-click the daytime clip on the timeline. In the Filmora setting, find the **Mask section > Circle**. You can see the mask is applied in the preview screen.

![double-click the daytime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-5.jpg)

Step2 Scroll down the setting and click add a keyframe at the beginning of the clip.

![scroll down the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-6.jpg)

Step3 Change the scale of the mask to the smallest number and adjust the Width and Height down to 0\. You can set the blur strength to 15 to make the transition edge smoother.

![change the scale of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-7.jpg)

Step4 Move the play head to find the spot where you want the mask fully opens up, then add another keyframe. Change the scale of the mask to 2 and the Width and Height to 50\. Make sure the mask occupies the whole frame.

![add another keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-8.jpg)

Now, if you play back, you can see the nighttime becomes daytime through the mask.

![nighttime becomes daytime through the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-9.gif)

If the movement in the two clips is a bit off, you can fix it by adding more keyframes on the mask.

**_3) Pro tips_**

You can add one more effect in Filmora to make it more magical. To do this, open the Effects window on the top left and find “Heartbeat” under the Basic section.

![add one more effect in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-10.jpg)

Drag and drop it onto the third video track and start the effect when the mask opens up. Then, trim the effect length to match the movement. Adjust the speed of this effect if needed.

![adjust the speed of this effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-11.jpg)

The final result will look like this:

## Dubbing Videos With Voiceovers | Wondershare Filmora Tutorial

Voiceovers have been a great utility in the digital ecosystem for a while. From movies to videos, the use of voiceovers has provided content creators with new dynamics. While it has enhanced the quality of video creation, there are other technicalities that have arisen against it. In this article, we will be discussing the details involving voiceovers and recordings.

Also, it includes a discussion of tools that can be used to ensure professional voice recordings. Go through the provided details to know how to utilize voiceovers to perfection.

## Part 1: What is The Difference Between Voice Recording and Voiceover?

Do you know **voiceover** and voice recording are two different terms? They are often used correspondingly but have different meanings. Here are a few differences between the two in the section below:

**Voice Recording**

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations. Ultimately, we can say that voiceover is a part of voice recording that should be synchronized with the visual media to fulfill its purpose.

A high-quality voiceover with clear pronunciation allows the audience to understand the topic better. Moreover, proper timing and appropriate intonation also polish the video content.

### 5\. Localization and Accessibility

Speech-to-text software can easily translate and localize into different languages. This function of voiceovers can make the video accessible to a wider audience. By generating voiceovers in different languages, you can help you reach international viewers. Similarly, it expands your audience and increases the video's potential impact.

Another benefit of voiceover is that it provides flexibility during the editing process. You can record it separately and edit and improve it to fit the visuals precisely.

Regardless, do you know why voiceovers are considered beneficial in video editing? Let’s look ahead into some prominent benefits of using voiceovers:

### 1\. Narrative and Information

Voiceover provides a narrative element to a video. This further guides the viewers through the content and conveys important information. It also allows you to explain concepts, provide context, or tell a story to your engaged audience.

### 2\. Clarity and Comprehension

This also helps clarify complex concepts by providing a verbal explanation. It ensures that viewers can easily understand the message or purpose of the video. Even if the visuals alone are insufficient, text-to-speech generators can help. Moreover, voiceover adds an additional layer of information that can aid comprehension.

### 3\. Storytelling and Emotional Impact

It allows you to add emotions, tone, and personality to the video. Furthermore, it can set the mood to create a connection with the audience. A well-executed voiceover can also improve the storytelling aspect of the video. Similarly, people tend to memorize such videos which have an impactful speech or voice recording.

### 4\. Professionalism and Polishing

Including a voiceover in your video adds a level of professionalism and polish. It gives the impression that careful thought and planning went into the production. A high-quality voiceover with clear pronunciation allows the audience to understand the topic better. Moreover, proper timing and appropriate intonation also polish the video content.

### 5\. Localization and Accessibility

Speech-to-text software can easily translate and localize into different languages. This function of voiceovers can make the video accessible to a wider audience. By generating voiceovers in different languages, you can help you reach international viewers. Similarly, it expands your audience and increases the video's potential impact.

### 6\. Flexibility and Flexibility

Another benefit of voiceover is that it provides flexibility during the editing process. You can record it separately and edit and improve it to fit the visuals precisely. This allows you to refine the narration, adjust the pacing, and ensure synchronization. Additionally, it also provides flexibility in terms of making changes or updates to the script.

### 7\. Reducing Noise and Distractions

Lastly, voiceover allows you to reduce or eliminate background noise and even unwanted sounds. You can also enhance the audio quality and eliminate distractions from your video. Meanwhile, the elimination of such elements also improves the overall viewer experience.

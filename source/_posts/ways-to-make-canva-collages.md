We'll walk you through a workaround to get a blurred backdrop because the functionality is presently unavailable for mobile devices.

On your updated Zoom application, this new high res zoom background tool might be useful for a variety of reasons, whether you want to protect your privacy or conceal your filthy room. Consider a scenario in which you have a Zoom meeting but your usual workspace at home is occupied. Panic sets in because you don't have time to clean everything up or locate a private, neutral location to set up.

This simple toggleable feature is already present in Zoom and may be used to keep your area private or to make cluttered spaces uncertain. We'll provide you a step-by-step tutorial in this post on how to activate blurred backdrop for your next meeting.

## Part 1: How to blur Zoom background on Windows

Before and during meetings, users of the official Zoom desktop client for Windows have the option to blur the backdrop. Before a meeting, login into Zoom on the desktop application to activate backdrop blur. After that, choose Settings by clicking on the profile symbol in the upper left corner. Click the "Blur" option under "Backgrounds & Filters" after making your selection. The user may attend the meeting when the backdrop becomes blurry. Here are the steps to blur a Zoom backdrop during a meeting:

During a Zoom call on Windows 10, blur your backdrop as follows:

Step1Find the bar at the bottom of the meeting screen. To make it visible, you may need to move your mouse to the bottom.

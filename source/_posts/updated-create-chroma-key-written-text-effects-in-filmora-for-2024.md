## Create Chroma Key Written Text Effects in Filmora

Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.

## Part 1\. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?

Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.

![chroma key text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png)

Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it's an easy way to make 3D motion videos.

To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:

## Part 2\. Filming Tips for Written Texts

To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.

### Tip 1\. A Pen and a White Paper

We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.

We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:

![purple color pen on white paper](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png)

It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it's more apparent during filming.

### Tip 2\. Different Color Paper

There are many chances that you don't have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don't need to worry because you can use different color papers too.

But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.

![different color paper with different markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don't use dull color pens with bright color paper.

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

### Tip 4\. Larger Size of Letters

As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

![the larger size of the written key text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-5.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.

After filming all the clips, you must edit those shots on the Filmora to get the chroma effect. Scroll more to get the step-by-step process!

## What is the importance of Adding Stylish Text?

As a Youtuber, creating thumbnails is one of the essential aspects of getting the attention of your audience. A thumbnail is a small image inserted into a video that exemplifies larger content inside the video or article. Millions of videos are produced and uploaded on the Internet every single day, so it's essential for yours to stand out. Text on videos has several different added benefits as well. In this video, we'll give four reasons why you should start adding text to your videos.

### **1\. Content becomes easy to remember**

Viewer Retention (sometimes referred to as "Audience Retention") is the average percentage of a video that people watch. Videos with high Viewer Retention scores tend to sell more. Adding some Text/Title in your video is one of the critical factors to remember because the viewers get multiple cue points (example: audio and text on video) to confirm their understanding and retain the essence of the messaging.

### **2\. Make sense even without sound**

A lot of people watch videos on mute mode. A recent study indicates that 85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound. A lot of us consume videos while in transit and sometimes at work as well :).

Text is very expository for most of these videos since it'd help in building the proper context for the viewer.

### **3\. It Helps Summarize Key Points**

Some audiences are looking for a summary of the video in an instant to save more time. As Youtuber, it is very helpful if you will add Text/Titles as caption perse in a video. For example, one needs to remember 2-3 tips for driving. If the captions or text show up on the video when the driver talks about this and that, that's better!

### **4\. Aesthetics**

Some people don't care much about the graphics; they just go through the textual content. This is because texts are the major sources of information. Adding Styling Text/Titles can make a video engaging and attractive. The audience wants to see some color and action in the videos to grasp the storyboard easily.

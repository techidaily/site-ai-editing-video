## How to Do Masking in After Effects [Alternative Provided]

Masking is a powerful feature in After Effects that allows you to hide, reveal, or manipulate specific parts of a layer. Whether creating animations, visual effects, or enhancing your video content, masking can be a valuable tool in your arsenal. However, it can be intimidating for beginners, as it requires a good understanding of key concepts and techniques.

This article aims to demystify masking in After Effects and provide a comprehensive guide on getting started.

So let's dive in and discover the art of masking in After Effects!

![masking in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-masking.JPG)

## Overview of Masking in After Effects

Masking in After Effects hides or reveals certain layer parts, such as an image or video. This is achieved through masks, paths that determine the visibility of specific layer parts. Masks are an incredibly versatile tool in Adobe After Effects, allowing users to cut out and combine elements, create professional transitions, isolate objects in photos or videos, and build shapes, among other things.

Masks in After Effects are made up of two parts: the mask and the fill. The mask controls what is visible, while the fill determines the color or image used to fill the masked area.

By default, when a mask is created, it is set to "inverted," meaning the masked area is visible, and the rest is hidden. However, this can easily be changed by pressing "M" to access the mask settings in the timeline and selecting the invert checkmark. Alternatively, the mode can be changed to subtract.

Overall, masks are an essential tool in After Effects, and it's worth taking the time to learn as much as possible about them. The possibilities are endless, and mastering masks can greatly enhance your projects.

You can get a gif maker from the app store and turn your life photos into a gif quickly with all the effects you have added previously.

### 02How to create a gif with android?

Different Android phones offer different options to turn photos and other animations into gifs. For example, in Samsung Galaxy phones, one can use gif-making features already available in the pre-installed gallery app. In addition, Google photos have a ‘motion photos' feature that can be converted and used to make GIFs easily using third-party apps you can easily find on Play Store.

### 03You can use a gif making app

Making GIFs from native tools is fantastic, but you can't get all the features when using a native tool on your phone. However, you can download a gif generator online to help you make GIFs easily with your phone itself.

## How to Create an Alternate Reality Effect

Ditch boring one-dimensional videos and create a mesmerizing video with this alternative reality effect you can easily create using Wondershare Filmora.

This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?

Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.

![a preview of the alternate reality effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-1.gif)

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

### Step by Step on How to Resize Videos using Filmora

Resizing videos in Filmora is a quick and easy process. To resize videos, first make sure you have imported your video file into the editor.

**Resizing by changing the dimensions**

Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop the file on the screen or click on "Import Files" in the toolbar.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-7.png)

Step 3: You can also use the size fields at the bottom of the frame to change their dimensions.

Step 4: Keep in mind that changing one dimension of a video clip will affect both its width and height proportionally. For example, if you enlarge a 16:9 widescreen clip to 720p (from 480p), it will be double its original proportions (720x480).

**Resizing by shrinking video file size.**

Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop it onto the screen or use the toolbar's "Import Files" option.

Then, in the "Settings" panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by choosing a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. When it comes to video formats, you can choose among FLV, MP4, and other similar formats, which normally result in smaller files.

You might wish to put all of the films or photographs you want to merge into one folder on your computer before going to the Photos app. It will aid in the speeding up of the entire procedure.

Type 'Photos' into your computer's search bar, then click on the program that appears.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-6.jpg)

### Step 2: Start a New Video Project

You want to start your video production after launching the Photos app. To do so, go to the top right corner of your screen and select New Video Project, which will take you to the editor mode.

The second part of this procedure is known by several titles in different versions of Windows 10's Photos app, such as creating a video with music, creating a film with text, and a new video project.

Launching the editor mode directly from the photo if you're using photos in your video project is also possible. In that case, consider the following:

* Open your file in the Photos app
* Select Edit & Create
* Select Create a movie with text from the drop-down menu.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-7.jpg)

You can name the project by typing it in the name tab in the top left corner of your screen. Then, by clicking the pencil icon next to your project's name, you can alter your title at any moment.

The video editor in the Photos app won't allow you to upload files until you've given your project a title. When you try to add a file, a pop-up choice will display, and you may write in the project's name and then click OK or Create a Video to continue.

### Step 3: Import Files

To add files to your video project, go to the Project Library portion of your screen and click the + icon that you see in the top left corner.

If you have all of the files you wish to merge into one video in one folder, you can select them all and add them to your project using the 'This PC' option. Alternatively, you can add the files one by one.

The tool will automatically combine all of your files into a single video. Then, you can alter the video order in the Storyboard and edit them.

Go to your Project Library and drag all of the files you added to the video editor into the Storyboard section to get started on your project.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-8.jpg)

### Step 4: Trim Video Clips

You can also trim your clip in the Photos app if necessary. Here's how to do it:

* On your Storyboard, select the Trim icon.
* Using the handlebar, shorten or prolong the duration of your clip as desired.
* Select "Done" from the drop-down menu.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-9.jpg)

### Step 5: Remove/Add Sound

You can now select numerous music options from the Windows library or upload your own.

Select the Background Music option in the top-right corner of the screen. Then, mute or adjust the volume of your video.

Or select Add an audio file from the Custom Audio menu in the top-right corner of your screen, select the file you want to Import, click Open, make any necessary changes to the audio file, and select Done.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-10.jpg)

### Step 6: Add Text

You can add text to your video project using the Windows video editor, but there aren't many font styles to choose from. You'll also have to add and optimize your text for each clip separately, which isn't the most time-efficient approach.

To add text to your clips, follow these steps:

* Choose Text
* Select the small box icon on the clip you want to add text to
* In the empty box, type the text you wish to add.
* Select the font style you want to use.
* Choose where your text should show in the video.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-11.jpg)

### Step 7: Export/Save Merged File

You can save your video project to your computer after being happy with it. To do so, follow these steps:

* Click the Export, Share, or Finish movie option in the top right corner of your screen.
* Select the video resolution in which you want your video to be saved.

## FAQs

### Q1\. How to merge two MP4 videos into 1?

Whether you have two MP4 clips or videos with different extensions, you can easily merge them into one with Filmora. To do that, position both videos on the same track without space. Then, export the project in your desired output format, such as MP4.

### Q2\. What is the best app for combining videos?

For fast video joining, you can choose Filmora or Adobe Premiere Pro. Both apps are available on Windows and Mac operating systems. Moreover, the combining process is also trouble-free.

### Q3\. How to merge two videos without losing quality?

Professionals with years of video editing experience choose Premiere Pro to maintain the quality of the merged videos. But remember, any mistakes in the export settings can reduce the calibre. Contrarily, Filmora offers user-friendly and uncomplicated export options so you can save combined videos in the highest quality possible.

The step-by-step guide is to help beginners move ahead in their careers and choose the best method that they find easy. Each method is easy-to-use and accessible by all users.

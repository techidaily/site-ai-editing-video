#### Method 2: Accessing AI Portrait

**Step 1: Set the Videos at the Correct Place in the Timeline**

Import your Background video and main clips in the media panel. Drag the main video in the second track and the background video in the first track, respectively.

**Step 2: Explore and Utilize AI Portrait for Changing Background**

Head to the right-side panel and access the AI tools option for choosing “AI Portrait.” Toggle this option and get the background automatically changed. To further enhance, you can use “Edge Thickness” and “Edge Feather” sliders.

#### Method 3: Change the Background through Masking

**Step 1: Get Stock Media and Place it in the Timeline**

Drag your main video in the timeline. Then, tap the "Stock Media" icon from the toolbar of the media panel. Browse one background clip and bring it to the timeline at the second track.

**Step 2: Draw a Mask to Replace the Background with Stock Media**

Look for the “Mask” option before the “AI tools” option on the right-side panel. Pick the “Draw Mask” icon and try to draw the lines around the main figure. When you finish drawing, the background will be replaced. You can use the “Blur Strength” slider to give a natural look.

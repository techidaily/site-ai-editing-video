## 5 Tips for Faster Editing in Filmora Video Editor

It’s an indisputable fact that editing is an essential aspect of video creation, and it’s what brings your initial idea to life. However, it can be very daunting and time-consuming, especially when working on a video project containing lots of footage.

In this post, we will walk you through the five best tips that can come in handy to operate fast and smoothly while editing videos of any size. All you just need is the Filmora video editor. You don’t even require technical knowledge.

## 1\. Organize your Media

Since a video project usually has various elements, keeping track of them can take a lot of work. So, the first editing step should be to organize the files so that it is easy to follow them. To do that, you need to do the following;

**Create a Folder for Each Media File in your Project**

Creating folders involves sorting your video files into various categories, thus making it easy for you to look into specific files and find the missing ones quickly when you need them. For example, you can create a folder for A roll, B roll, Photos, Audio, Sound FX, Music, and Drone Footage. Follow the steps below to see how you can use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create a folder for each file in your video project;

Step1 Launch Filmora and click Create Project.

![launch filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 Navigate to the bottom left corner before the Timeline > click the Folder icon from there, as shown in the image below;

![navigate to the bottom left corner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Click on the folder icon until you reach the total number of folders you need to categorize your video files.

Right-click on each folder and name it accordingly.

![click on the folder icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-3.jpg)

After you name each folder, use the Import button to upload each video files you need to edit your video.

![use the Import button to upload each video files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-4.jpg)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** since the media files you import into your project get the name associated with the code given by the source, it becomes hard to capture a specific file while editing. You need to rename each of the elements you imported for easier access.

Step4 Rename all imported files. To rename your imported files, right-click on them to add a preferred name. Then, click Rename from the pop-up list to name the files.

![rename all imported files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-5.jpg)

## 2\. The Use of Proxies

Another tip that enhances a quick editing process is the use of proxies. Proxies can be described as low-resolution versions of your video files. So, if you’re working on video files that drag back playback speed, like 4K footage, you can create a proxy to enable your PC to handle the file seamlessly.

A tool like Filmora editor can help create proxies of your video file flawlessly. You just have to follow the steps below;

Step1 Locate the large video file you imported to Filmora and right-click it. Then, select Create Proxy File.

![locate the large video file to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 You should see the proxy icon at the bottom right corner of your video once it completes. This takes only a few minutes.

Step3 Drag-n-drop the video to the timeline and perform the necessary editing. Afterward, use the Export button to save the file to your PC.

![click on the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-3.jpg)

## 3\. Keep Your Videos and Audio Tracks Organized

This is similar to our first tip, and fortunately, the Filmora video editor facilitates this kind of operation quickly and easily. It involves organizing video and audio clips in the timeline while editing. For instance, use video track #1 for graphics or text, #2 for your B roll, and #1 for the main footage taken.

You will also do the same for Audio, for instance, Audio track #1 for music, Audio track #2 for dialogues, and many more. This will allow you to edit various clips simultaneously, making the editing process faster and easier. Here are the steps to use this tip;

Step1 Click on the Add icon at the left side of the Timeline and select Add Video Track or Add Audio Track to add more timelines for your clips.

![click on the add icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-audio-and-video-tracks-1.jpg)

Step2 Drag-n-drop the video clips and audio clips to the relevant timeline.

![drag-n-drop the video clips and audio clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-audio-and-video-tracks-2.jpg)

## 4\. Keyboard Shortcuts

These are commands on the keyboard of your pc that will enable you to edit your projects easily and quickly. Various options can be available by keying in specific orders rather than going through a long process using the mouse. This knowledge can be a real time-saver when handling projects. To get more enlightened on the setup in Filmora, follow the steps outlined below;

Step1 Open Filmora and click File from the top side.

Step2 Select Keyboard Shortcuts from the drop-down list.

![select keyboard shortcuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-keyboard-shortcuts-filmora-1.jpg)

Step3 The new pop-up window on your PC screen will display all shortcuts you can employ while using Filmora, and the interesting part is that you can customize the shortcut keys to your preference. Moreover, you can freely switch keyboard shortcuts between Filmora, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.

![customize the shortcut keys](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-keyboard-shortcuts-filmora-2.jpg)

Step4 For clicking CTRL+ALT+N will allow you to create a new folder for your file.

## 5\. Edit in Stages

Our final tip is to edit in stages. Yes, it is necessary to edit in stages when dealing with editing work. This helps to limit the time you spend on a project. In the beginning, you should do a rough cut. You can begin by editing the A roll at first and then move on to edit the B roll, moving on to the Sound FX, Music, Graphics, and Color Correction, and then reviewing the entire project before exporting it.

In case while editing the A roll, you find something that requires a quick fix in its audio, focus on it and, if possible, use a marker icon to describe it. This will help you not get confused once you get to the Audio stage. See the steps to use Filmora to do this below;

Step1 Firstly, focus on your video footage. Move them to the required timeline.

![focus on your video footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-in-stages-1.jpg)

Step2 Next, move your B-roll to the relevant timeline. Then, apply the required editing.

Step3 Afterward, move drag-n-drop the audio clips to the timeline and apply the needed edits.

![move drag-n-drop the audio clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-in-stages-2.jpg)

Repeat the process for different operations in stages until you finish.

## Conclusion

The editing process is about having a free mind where creativity is the primary focus. When you can do that, you will be able to complete your projects in a short time and work on various tasks simultaneously. The tips discussed in this article will go a long way in helping you handle your projects using Filmora.

You can use Filmora to edit videos and other media files downloaded from YouTube, Vimeo, and many more video-sharing sites. Follow these tips and make editing your video projects quite easy and fast.

## 2\. The Use of Proxies

Another tip that enhances a quick editing process is the use of proxies. Proxies can be described as low-resolution versions of your video files. So, if you’re working on video files that drag back playback speed, like 4K footage, you can create a proxy to enable your PC to handle the file seamlessly.

A tool like Filmora editor can help create proxies of your video file flawlessly. You just have to follow the steps below;

Step1 Locate the large video file you imported to Filmora and right-click it. Then, select Create Proxy File.

![add more circles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy-circle.png)

Step 12

After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the **Animation** tab.

![animation tab filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/animation.png)

Step 13

You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add**” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “**+Add**” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “**+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.

![add keyframe filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/keyframe.png)

Step 14

Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the **Scale** and the **Position values** as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.

For the **second keyframe**, just increase the **Scale** and adjust the **Position** value based on how it looks on the screen.

![circle position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/position.png)

Step 15

Now, apply the same method as in **Step 14** to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.

![keyframe positions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adjust.png)

Step 16

Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, **Enable** the **Outline** option and **Disable** the **Fill** option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.

Step 17

Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.

![edit text filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text.png)

Next, add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead near the end of this clip in the Timeline. Now, drag the X position to the left until you see the last letter of your text appear on the screen. Click **OK.**

![text animation settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/x-position.png)

## Part 1 How to Create a Custom Slide Show in PowerPoint?

PowerPoint presentations are an already elusive and captivating media of information delivery and content sharing, be it a personal entertainment need or a high end professional requirement, PowerPoint presentations can do it all! Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.

Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.

Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the **custom slide show** creation process with the finest details:

**User's Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint**

 **Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Tool**

Start the **custom slide show PowerPoint** creation process with launching the PowerPoint tool in any of your preferred devices. It would be better to work on a desktop or a PC. Proceed to open the presentation that you wish to create a custom slideshow from.

**Step 2: Custom Slide Show Option**

In the welcome interface of PowerPoint, navigate to the ribbon at the top and hit the ‘Slide Show' tab, followed by clicking on the ‘Custom Slide Show' button from the ‘Options Panel' that appears. As you tap the aforesaid button, a dropdown menu follows next, from where you need to choose the ‘Custom Shows…' option.

**Step 3: Custom Shows Dialog Box**

The completion of Step 2 brings up the ‘Custom Shows' dialog box, with a blank area at the left, indicating the absence of any custom slide show as yet. To create one, navigate to and click on the ‘New' button at the right side within the dialog box.

![Creating Custom Slide Shows- ‘Custom Shows' Dialog Box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-custom-slide-show-in-powerpoint-2.JPG)

**Step 4: Define Custom Show Dialog Box**

As you tap the ‘New' button, the ‘Define Custom Shows' dialog box pops up with a display of the following fields and buttons:

**●** **Slide Show Name Box**

Use this field to assign a name to your custom slideshow. In case you don't add a name of your choice, PowerPoint will assign the name ‘Custom Show 1' to your custom presentation.

**●** **Slides in Presentation**

Below the ‘Slide Show Name' box, appears a list of slides in the chosen presentation which you can use to create the custom slide show. To add slides to the same, click on the respective slide names.

**●** **Add Button**

The ‘Add' button in the middle of the ‘Define Custom Show' dialog box is used to include selected slides from the main list explained above to the ‘Slides in Custom Show' list at the right. The ‘Add' button however, remains disabled until you make a selection from the main slides list to include within the custom slides list. Take note that you can choose to repeat the slides within the custom list.

**●** **Remove Button**

You can use this button to select and delete specific slides from the ‘Slides in Custom Show' list. The button however, remains disabled till you make a slide selection to be removed.

**●** **Slides in Custom Show**

**●** **Re-Order Buttons**

These are ‘Up' and ‘Down' arrows at the right side of the ‘Define Custom Show' dialog box, which are active only if the ‘Slides in Custom Show' list has more than one slide to its credit. In such a case, you can use these arrows to change the sequence of appearance of the slides within the custom presentation.

![Creating Custom Slide Shows- ‘Define Custom Show' Dialog Box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-custom-slide-show-in-powerpoint-3.JPG)

## Part 3 How to Hide Slides in PowerPoint?

In case you have worked on a detailed slideshow presentation in the PowerPoint tool, that consists of selective contents for different audience groups, all within the main presentation, it is a wise step to hide the content slides that are not useful to particular audiences, lest your viewers might get distracted with the irrelevant content.

When working to share any kind of information through slideshow presentations, creating a custom show is just half the job, with the significant part of a flawless content presentation remains still under the line. Having understood the process of creating a **custom slide show in PowerPoint** in enough detail, let us now move ahead with learning how to show the same in PowerPoint in the following section:

**User's Guide to Play a Custom Slideshow in PowerPoint**

**Step 1: Launch the Parent Presentation**

From the list of options that appears next, click on the ‘Custom Slide Show' button.

The custom show is now your default slideshow. In your future launches of ‘Slide Show View', only the selected custom show slides will appear to be used as a presentation.

## Part 3 How to Hide Slides in PowerPoint?

In case you have worked on a detailed slideshow presentation in the PowerPoint tool, that consists of selective contents for different audience groups, all within the main presentation, it is a wise step to hide the content slides that are not useful to particular audiences, lest your viewers might get distracted with the irrelevant content.

By far, you must have developed a significant understanding of the **custom slideshow PowerPoint** creation and presentation procedure in much detail. Moving further into our discussion, let us now work on hiding slides within a PowerPoint presentation through the following step by step guide:

**How to Hide or Unhide a Slide in PowerPoint?**

**Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Presentation**

Start with opening a desired PowerPoint Presentation in your preferred device.

**Step 2: Make Your Selection**

Visit the slide navigation pane at the left to select slide you wish to delete. Your selections will be highlighted as you tap on them. You can either delete the slides one at a time, or make multiple selections to delete them all at once.

**Step 3: Hide Slide Option**

When you have made the required selections, right click on the same, followed by choosing the ‘Hide Slide' option from the dropdown menu that appears next. The selected slides will now be hidden and you can recognize them in the ‘Presenter View' with lighter thumbnails as compared to the included slides, in the slide navigation pane.

**Step 4: Unhiding the Presentation Slides**

If you wish to unhide a previously hidden presentation slide, reach to the slide navigation pane in the left and right click on the hidden slide thumbnail. The dropdown menu in Step 3 pops up again, and you need to tap on the ‘Hide Slide' option. The selected slide will now be included in the presentation.

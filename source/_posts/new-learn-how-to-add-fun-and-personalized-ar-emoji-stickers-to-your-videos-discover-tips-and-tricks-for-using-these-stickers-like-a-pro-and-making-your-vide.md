## Clone Yourself in Videos with Filmora

With the help of video editing programs like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can create clones of yourself. Whether you're looking to create a funny skit or a serious video, cloning yourself can add much production value to your project.

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of how to clone yourself in videos using Filmora.

## Part 1: How to Film Clips for Cloning Effects?

To make cloning effects, you will need to take two different shots and use a tripod to place the camera, so the frame doesn't change.

**Shooting the first clip**

For the first shot, stay on one side of the frame and do the first action. For example, you can pretend to yank and take off your jacket. Then, drop the jacket to the other side of the frame.

![shooting the first clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-1.gif)

To make it more realistic, make an interaction by reacting to the "clone" while facing the other direction.

![make an interaction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-2.jpg)

**Shooting the second clip**

Then, shoot for the second clip without changing the frame. You will have to go to the place where you dropped the jacket from the first shot.

![shooting the second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-3.gif)

Act as if you have just appeared there and give a reaction to the other side as well.

## Part 2: How to Do the Clone Effect with Filmora?

After you have shot the necessary film clips, bring the clips into Filmora 11\. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can go to their website and download it here:

Once you have opened Filmora 11, follow the steps below:

Step1 Bring the first clip to the timeline and cut the clip where you pretend to yank and take off the jacket. Select and delete the unnecessary clip.

![bring the first clip to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg)

Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let's start working on the clone part using masking.

First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the "clone."

![place the second clip on a different window track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg)

Then, double-click the second clip and go to the Filmora setting window. Tap on the **Mask** section > **Single line**.

![tap on mask section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-6.jpg)

On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show "the clone."

![adjust the position of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif)

Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.

Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn't match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11\. To use it, double-click the second clip and select **Speed > Speed Ramping > Customize**.

![double-click the second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-8.jpg)

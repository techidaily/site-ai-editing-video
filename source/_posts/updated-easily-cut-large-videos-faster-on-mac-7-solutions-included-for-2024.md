Therefore, it can be pretty challenging to figure out the best option for your video cutting needs. Below are some factors to consider when choosing between a paid or free video cutter on Mac.

### · Intuitive Workflow

Some software is quite difficult to operate, and you could spend hours figuring out how each tool works. An efficient video cutting software makes all tools easy to use. Ensure the large video cutter you choose ensures a seamless workflow to improve your efficiency. In addition, a fast-processing feature is necessary to reduce the editing time significantly.

### · Budget

Another factor that’s important to consider is your budget. You can use free software, but you need to note that the features are limited. If the tool doesn’t offer you the features you’re looking for, you might need to subscribe to a paid video cutter. Always choose a video cutter that falls within your budget.

### · Experience Level

Are you looking to develop your editing skills? Then a paid large video cutter is the best option for you. There are usually advanced and basic tools available to help you edit your skills. However, a paid video cutter also offers you more functionality that can help you learn how to create impressive edited videos.

Overall, you want a video editor with an easy learning curve and one that meets your needs effectively. The goal is to get a video editor that will provide you with more editing tools to enhance your video. It is pretty easy to outgrow free video cutters because of their limited features. However, if you’re choosing a paid video cutter, ensure it isn’t made for professionals and, therefore, is challenging to navigate.

## Part 1: What is SRT?

An SRT is one of the most common formats used in subtitling or captioning files. 'SRT' refers to a 'SubRip Subtitle' file, which originated from the DVD-ripping software by the same name. [SubRip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) would extract or rip subtitles and timings from live video, recorded video, and DVDs.

SRT has four major components:

1. A numeric counter indicates the number or position of the subtitle.
2. A Start and end time of the subtitle which is separated by the characters.
3. A Subtitle in one or more lines.
4. A blank line indicates the ending of the subtitle.

TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.

### MP4

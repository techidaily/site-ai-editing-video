## Part 2: Possible Causes of SRT Subtitles Not Working Properly in VLC

While users can **add subtitles to VLC** since the player supports SRT extension files, some issues can cause them not to appear. Here are some potential causes of the error.

**SRT files corrupted or empty**

In case the SRT file you are trying to access is corrupted or does not contain any content, that will not open in the VLC media player.

**The subtitles setting in VLC Media Player is not turned on**

Sometimes, the SRT files are password protected or only work on video players that allow permission for it to play. So, if you have not enabled SRT access in the settings of the app, the SRT-formatted text will not appear.

**Doesn’t update VLC to the latest version**

In cases when the VLC Media Player itself is corrupted or outdated, it cannot allow access to some subtitle formats. You must upgrade it to the latest official version to allow video and SRT file support.

**Wrong encoding instead of UTF-8**

VLC player app only allows the SRT files that have UTF-8 encoding to play on the platform. Users can view the SRT files on videos if they are using the right encoded text, so make sure that you do not have the wrong encoded file.

**Other unknown bugs**

Other issues can cause the defect to the VLC player and, therefore, cannot open the **VLC SRT file.** These include certain unknown bugs and malware- make sure to check your system to find the errors.

## Part 1: Things to Learn Before Editing First Draft

You have shot your video and now you’re stuck on the post-processing of that video. Don’t worry! We got you covered through this article which will guide you through the different things which you must learn before editing the first draft of your video.

### Start a video project

Your smartphone and digital camera can let you record multiple videos but what now? You head out to edit your first draft by choosing a suitable platform or software and then you can surely lay back and see the software doing wonders to your raw videos. By starting off with editing, you choose your video editing preferences and then you just let the video editing tools do the magic.

### Get to know the video editing software workspace

Video editing software offer customizable workspaces for different editing tasks. The software workspace streamlines routine actions you take with clips, like editing clips, making DVD and Blu-ray menus, and sharing movies. By placing panels in the layout that best matches your working style, you can personalize your workspace. The additional panels adjust automatically to fit the window as you rearrange them. For various jobs, such as one for editing and one for preview, you can build and store multiple workspaces.

### Understand the timeline

The timeline of your video is the backbone of your digital video editing process. It’s called a timeline because the various pieces of video will be lined up horizontally. In a video editing software, the timeline is where you arrange your video clips and plan out all the modifications you want to do. As you work, you will see every single one of your video and audio clips, effects, and transitions sorted chronologically from beginning to end. All the fundamentals of video editing, including reordering, trimming, and enhancing your footage, are available.

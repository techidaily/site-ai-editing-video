Premiere Pro is a powerful editing program that lets you create and edit clips using its wide range of features and tools to make professional-looking videos. The best thing about the software is that you can quickly blur the background of your footage to add a bit of depth and interest, as well as to make your subject stand out more.

To make things simpler for you, we’ve compiled this comprehensive guide to walk you through the step-by-step process of **how to blur the background in Premiere Pro** so that you notice a big difference in your videos!

## Part 1\. Why Do You Need To Blur The Video Background?

The blurred background effect is a useful technique used by many professionals to create a focus on the element in the video and remove any distortions. By doing so, they add emphasis on the most important on-screen subject and make it pop on the screen.

You may need to blur the video background for several reasons. Perhaps you're recording a tutorial and want to add focus on one element, or maybe you're filming a scene in a crowded public place and wish to minimize distractions in your video.

Blurring the BG can also be a way to add a creative touch to your video or make them more immersive, polished, and professional.

## Part 2\. How To Blur Your Background In Premiere Pro?

Below, we’ve provided a step-by-step guide to help you **blur the background in Premiere Pro:**

Step1 In the first step, open a browser and visit the [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/elements-family/premiere-elements/download-trial/try.html) download page. Log in with your Adobe ID or [create a new one](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/manage-account.html#CreateanAdobeID). Choose the platform and language, and click **“Download”** to get the installation file.

![downloading premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/downloading-premiere-pro.png)

Click the downloaded installer to install the software and launch it. Now, click the **“File”** option from the top toolbar and select **“Import”** to open the **File Explorer** window. Locate your video footage and click **“Open”** to import it to Adobe Premiere.

![importing file to premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/importing-file-to-premiere-pro.png)

Step2 In the next step, click the **“Window”** option from the top toolbar and select **“Effects”** from the drop-down menu to open the **“Effects Panel.”**

In the Effects Panel, type **“Blur”** in the search bar and scroll down to find the **“Gaussian Blur”** effect. Drag and drop the effect on the clip in the timeline to apply.

Step3 Now, click **“Window”** in the top toolbar and select **“Effect Controls”** to open its panel. Scroll down to **“Gaussian Effect”** in the panel and increase the blurriness amount. This will make your entire clip blurry, including the subject/main element.If the edges of your clips become dark, checkmark the **“Repeat Edge Pixels”** option to resolve this issue.

![applying the repeat edge pixels to remove dark edges](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/applying-the-repeat-edge-pixels-to-remove-dark-edges.png)

Step4 Next, you have to create a mask around the subject to unblur it. To do so, click the **“Free**

**Draw Bezier”** under the **“Gaussian Blur”** option in the **Effects Control Panel.**

Now, in the **Program Monitor** window, trace the outline of the element/subject in your video. Make sure to bring the trace line to the original point.

Step5 Checkmark the **“Inverted”** option under the **Mask Expansion** header in the **Effects Control Panel** to make your background blurry. Click the **“Play”** icon to preview your video and if you find any hard edges around the subject, click **“Mask”** and choose the selection tool.

![inverting the mask to blur background in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/inverting-the-mask-to-blur-background-in-premiere-pro.png)

Now, make adjustments to the individual points in the outline. Click **“Mask Expansion”** and increase its value to expand the mask size. Then, click **“Mask Feather”** and decrease its value to soften the edges.

Step6 If your subject moves around in some parts, click the toggle next to **“Mask Path”** to create keyframes. Now, move through the timeline and adjust the mask on the subject to make a professional-looking video.

## Step by Step to Cut Video in Adobe Premiere Pro

Video editing is an essential skill in a world that has a growing focus on creative fields. And if you work with videos, knowing which clips to use and where to cut is essential in conveying your story and increasing its impact. So, if you are a beginner and want to familiarise yourself with steps and terms used in video editing, in this article, we will go through the steps you will need to cut your video file in Adobe Premiere Pro and Wondershare Filmora.

_This guide uses Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 and Wondershare Filmora X._

## How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Once you have Adobe Premiere Pro open on your computer, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Create a new project in Premiere Pro.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-1.jpeg)

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg)

You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create **Bins**, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg)

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an **In Point**and an **Out Point.** These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.

_We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below._

1. Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons \[marked in Yellow\] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.
1. You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.

From the process you will learn below, it is easy to assume that Wondershare Filmora is more convenient for beginners and provides software features that match paid professional software.

Once you have the editing software open, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a video file by clicking on the import window.

The default project setting for Filmora X is 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. Users can change this to match their video file by going into Project Settings under the File tab or by accepting the automatic prompt that appears when dragging the video file onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-8.jpeg)

**Note:** If you have a PC with weak hardware, Wondershare Filmora gives you the option to create Video Proxies that will reduce the load on your computer by creating smaller clips that are lower in size, resulting in a smoother and faster experience. You can also do this in Premiere Pro, but Filmora does it for you automatically once given permission.

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the Timeline to begin previewing it in the Playback Window and commence editing operations.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-9.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Locate where you want to cut in the video file and click on the orange scissors option to split the video file.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-10.jpeg)

**Tip:** You can also use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B) to cut without using a mouse click, in case you make use of a trackpad while editing.

The Bottom Line

As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

**Note:** If you don’t have Wondershare Filmora installed, you can get the video editor by visiting its [official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Once the setup program download completes, execute it and begin the installation process.

Once you have the editing software open, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a video file by clicking on the import window.

The default project setting for Filmora X is 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. Users can change this to match their video file by going into Project Settings under the File tab or by accepting the automatic prompt that appears when dragging the video file onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-8.jpeg)

**Note:** If you have a PC with weak hardware, Wondershare Filmora gives you the option to create Video Proxies that will reduce the load on your computer by creating smaller clips that are lower in size, resulting in a smoother and faster experience. You can also do this in Premiere Pro, but Filmora does it for you automatically once given permission.

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the Timeline to begin previewing it in the Playback Window and commence editing operations.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-9.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Locate where you want to cut in the video file and click on the orange scissors option to split the video file.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-10.jpeg)

**Tip:** You can also use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B) to cut without using a mouse click, in case you make use of a trackpad while editing.

The Bottom Line

As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg)

You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create **Bins**, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg)

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an **In Point**and an **Out Point.** These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.

_We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below._

1. Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons \[marked in Yellow\] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.
1. You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.

In today's world, the most famous companies are recognized worldwide via their brand image. Be it the "big M" of McDonald's or the "horses" of Ferrari, we very well know these brands by their respective logos. A company's logo is hence one of the most essential parts of branding and marketing. Moreover, a logo is one of the first steps towards brand building. Only after deciding on a specific logo can a company begin its commercial operations. Therefore, an attractive transparent logo is highly essential. Wondering what a transparent logo PNG is?

03 [7 Popular Transparent Logo Examples You Might Want to Learn](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.

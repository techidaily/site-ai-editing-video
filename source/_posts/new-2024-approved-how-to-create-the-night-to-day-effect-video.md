## How to Create the Night-to-Day Effect Video

Do you wish you could control when it's nighttime to daytime? It would make getting ready in the morning much faster! This tutorial will show you how to use the keyframe and mask feature in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make a remarkable night-to-day transition.

## How-to Guide

**_1) Preparation_**

For this effect, you will need to shoot two footage shots with the same frame. The first is for the daytime clip, and the second is for nighttime.

But before that, you need to prepare some things, such as:

1. Tripod to ensure your camera stays at the same point, so the frame doesn't change.
2. Mark the place where you want to shoot the scene. You can put a marker on the floor to ensure that you perform at the same spot in different shots.

Once done, let's start shooting to get the footage.

**_2) Steps_**

**Shooting footages**

First, get the daytime shot. For this tutorial, we will pretend that you are walking and transitioning into nighttime at the spot you have marked.

Now, let's film the nighttime clip. You will walk through the living room and do the same movement again at the same spot. You can dim the light and change the camera's white balance settings to bluer to create a night feeling.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
After you have both clips that you need, let's go to Filmora and start editing.

**Night-to-day transition**

Step1 Launch Filmora and import the footage into the program. If you haven't installed it, you can download Filmora on their website here: <https://filmora.wondershare.com>

Step2 Place the nighttime video clip on the first video track of the timeline and place the daytime clip on the top.

![place the daytime clip on the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-3.jpg)

Step3 Find the spot where you want to create a transition between the day and nighttime. Then, you can delete the unwanted part.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step4 Since the transition for this tutorial is where the subject started waving, make sure to place the daytime clip at the same time the subject started waving in the nighttime clip. Hence, the timing in both clips syncs.

**Masking transition**

For the next step, we will make a masking transition with the Filmora mask feature.

Step1 Double-click the daytime clip on the timeline. In the Filmora setting, find the **Mask section > Circle**. You can see the mask is applied in the preview screen.

![double-click the daytime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step2 Scroll down the setting and click add a keyframe at the beginning of the clip.

![scroll down the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-6.jpg)

Step3 Change the scale of the mask to the smallest number and adjust the Width and Height down to 0\. You can set the blur strength to 15 to make the transition edge smoother.

![change the scale of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-7.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step4 Move the play head to find the spot where you want the mask fully opens up, then add another keyframe. Change the scale of the mask to 2 and the Width and Height to 50\. Make sure the mask occupies the whole frame.

![add another keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-8.jpg)

Now, if you play back, you can see the nighttime becomes daytime through the mask.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
If the movement in the two clips is a bit off, you can fix it by adding more keyframes on the mask.

**_3) Pro tips_**

You can add one more effect in Filmora to make it more magical. To do this, open the Effects window on the top left and find “Heartbeat” under the Basic section.

![add one more effect in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-10.jpg)

Drag and drop it onto the third video track and start the effect when the mask opens up. Then, trim the effect length to match the movement. Adjust the speed of this effect if needed.

![adjust the speed of this effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-11.jpg)

The final result will look like this:

### 1\. RE: Vision Effects ReelSmart Motion Blur

RSMB is a powerful motion blur plugin that contains various advanced features. By adding this motion blur plugin, you can instantly add a motion blur effect to your videos without any manual effort. Moreover, within this tool, you can also adjust the amount of blur that you want to apply to your video. You can also generate compelling effects using RSMB by blurring a sequence of motion, preferably.

**Price:** For After Effects, the regular version costs about $109.95\. Whereas for the Pro version, the cost is $169.95.

**Download:** ReelSmart shows great compatibility with popular software such as Premiere Pro, After Effects, and many more. However, the subscription and download plans for each software are different. So, if you want to learn more about this plugin, you can navigate to its [official website](https://revisionfx.com/products/rsmb/premiere-pro/).

**Key Features**

* RSMB uses automatic tracking for each pixel so that the motion blur effect can be applied with great precision.
* You can adjust the amount and strength of motion blur through this plugin.
* With the help of advanced technology, RSMB can use the technique of object separation. Through this capability, the plugin can easily separate background and foreground efficiently.
* You can also use RSMB to track 360 footages for adding motion blur. Due to its advanced algorithms, it easily adds a motion blur effect to 360 videos by considering the sides, bottoms, tops, and edges.

**What We Like**

* RSMB can use spline guidance that can help you to animate shapes to display the movement of the objects. Thus, even if this plugin encounters tracking problems, you can always guide the object’s movement.
* Apart from adding a motion blur effect, you can also use RSMB to remove this blur effect without compromising the quality of your video.

**What We Don’t Like**

* A wide range of advanced features is only available in the pro version of RSMB. Thus, it can be expensive for beginner users.

## Part 2: 3 Motion Blur Plugins for Adobe Effects

Are you ready to use the **best motion blur plugin of After Effects**? In this section, we will discuss the top 3 motion blur plugins that can help you to create a motion blur effect in After Effects.

### 1\. RE: Vision Effects ReelSmart Motion Blur

RSMB is a powerful motion blur plugin that contains various advanced features. By adding this motion blur plugin, you can instantly add a motion blur effect to your videos without any manual effort. Moreover, within this tool, you can also adjust the amount of blur that you want to apply to your video. You can also generate compelling effects using RSMB by blurring a sequence of motion, preferably.

**Price:** For After Effects, the regular version costs about $109.95\. Whereas for the Pro version, the cost is $169.95.

**Download:** ReelSmart shows great compatibility with popular software such as Premiere Pro, After Effects, and many more. However, the subscription and download plans for each software are different. So, if you want to learn more about this plugin, you can navigate to its [official website](https://revisionfx.com/products/rsmb/premiere-pro/).

**Key Features**

* RSMB uses automatic tracking for each pixel so that the motion blur effect can be applied with great precision.
* You can adjust the amount and strength of motion blur through this plugin.
* With the help of advanced technology, RSMB can use the technique of object separation. Through this capability, the plugin can easily separate background and foreground efficiently.

**What We Like**

* Apart from adding a motion blur effect, you can also use RSMB to remove this blur effect without compromising the quality of your video.

**What We Don’t Like**

* A wide range of advanced features is only available in the pro version of RSMB. Thus, it can be expensive for beginner users.

You can edit media files (image, audio, video) by using the built-in tools on Filmora. You can add titles, intro text, and watermarks to your video with filters and overlays. You can also add background music, transitions, and slow/fast-motion effects to make your GIF more interesting. If you want to remove the background of an image sequence or a video clip, you can use the green screen effect as well.

**Step 4: Add text effects**

Once you have imported the GIF file, you can add a text effect to it by double-clicking on the video track. Then go to Text/Credit and choose your desired one from the given options. You can adjust the size of text, font style, color, position, etc. as per your choice. You can also add some transition effects by clicking on Transitions. Once done, click OK to save changes or drag the text into the timeline for further editing.

**Step 5: Save and Export**

Once you are satisfied with your video, click “File” in the top left corner of the window. From the drop-down menu, select “Export” to get to the export window.

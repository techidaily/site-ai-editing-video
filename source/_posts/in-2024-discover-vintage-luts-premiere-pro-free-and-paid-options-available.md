## Part 1\. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?

The jagged lines, the colorful pixels, frozen visuals, and also the distorted colors, everything perfectly blends to make a glitch effect. Usually, this is how all the glitch templates are, but if you get an opportunity to customize your image glitch effect and make your special effect, what will you do?

The best option to adopt in any such circumstances is Photoshop. With Photoshop, you can create a stunning and mind-blowing Photoshop VHS effect. If you want to learn about its steps, then continue reading.

Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the 'Image' menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the 'Adjustments' option and select 'Desaturate.'

![tap on desaturate option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-1.jpg)

Step 2: Now duplicate the image by dragging it onto the New Layer icon in the Layers Panel. Then double click on the duplicated image. This will open a ‘Layer Style’ settings menu. Here, click on the icon for ‘R Channel’ and deselect it.

![disable channel r](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-2.jpg)

Step 3: Now, it's time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left/right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.

![add first glitch element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-3.jpg)

Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.

![use mark and move tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-4.jpg)

Step 5: At this point, make a New Layer and fill it with White. Now right-click on this white layer and select the option of 'Convert to Smart Object.'

![tap on the option of convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-5.jpg)

Step 6: Move to the menu bar at the top and go to the 'Filter' section. From there, select the option of 'Filter Gallery.' A new window will show up. Head to the 'Sketch' category, and there change the 'Pattern Type' to 'Line.' You can also play with the 'Contrast' and the 'Size' of the lines.

![change the pattern](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-6.jpg)

Step 7: Now, in the ‘Layers Panel,’ select the option of ‘Overlay’ from the dropdown menu so that the different layers can show through. You can adjust the visibility of the lines by adjusting the number on the scale.

![tap on overlay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-7.jpg)

Step 8: After setting everything for the glitch effect in your image, you can now add colors using the ‘Gradient Map.’ Or you can also import some graphic textures to Photoshop and add them to the image. Don’t forget to change the ‘Binding Mode’ to 'Overlay.' You can then play with the color and graphic settings.

![change the binding mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-8.jpg)

Step 9: Once all the color adjustments have satisfied you, it's time to add some text to your glitch image. For that, head to the ‘Text’ tool from the left menu and type in your text. Edit it as you did to your image so that you can make a cool glitch text effect Photoshop and with this, you are all done with making the most stunning glitch effect Photoshop.

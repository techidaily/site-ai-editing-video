## Here, You Will Learn How to Add a Realistic Fire Effect Using Wondershare Filmora. That Will Help to Boost Your Channel and Decorate Your YouTube Channel with Creative and Unique Effects

Do you know that many cinema films and big-budget companies use visual effects to create realistic fires? It saves them from potential danger in production and helps them manage the time required to create a project. In this article, you will get pro tips and easy ways to add Fire effects by Wondershare Filmora.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** let's not count Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan productions because their movies have a higher budget, and creating fake fire is easy.

## Part 1\. What do you need to create fire effects?

Using simple tools such as Filmora and visual effects, you can create a realistic fire effect with an easy setup. For filming the effect, we will need

1. A good camera
2. A light source
3. Video editing software - Wondershare Filmora
4. Basic editing skills

However, the light source is key to the fire effects. It will be beneficial if you have a **warmer color** light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use **tungsten** light bulbs or small circular **LEDs** that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.

## Part 2\. How to make a realistic effect fire?

After getting prepared, it's time to do the real things. Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.

##### Step1 Record your footage

While recording the video, you can **slightly shake** your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.

**Shaking the light manually**

Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.

![shaking the light source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-1.gif)

**Shaking the light using a dimmer**

You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a **dimmer**, your work will be more accessible.

A **regulator** on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.

![dimmer for shaking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-2.jpg)

##### Step2 Record the object

Our next step will be to record the object on which the effect is taking place. Ensure the camera is placed under a **good light** source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the **level of the eye** so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.

Also, keep in mind to **zoom out** the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object. The more natural the acting is, the more realistic would be the fire effect.

##### Step3 Edit the footage

We are being safe and saving time by not using actual fire. The **goal** of creating a fake fire would be the effect and reaction of the object or the actor.

**1\. Download a professional video editing software - Wondershare Filmora**

Visit [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) official site if you haven't already downloaded it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** download the latest version of filmora. It will give you a pro version and help you to create more realistic fire effects.

**2\. Create a new project and import the recorded clips**

Before adding the fire effects to your video, you must ensure that you are familiar with the editing software. Your first step would be to add your clips to the **timeline.** Drag the footage from the library and enter it into the timeline.

![import footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-3.jpg)

**3\. create the fire effect more realistic by adding smoke**

The next step would be to add smoke to the fire. As it is only fair that the fire makes the smoke so. Adding the smoke will create the fire effect more realistic. Follow the below steps to get your cinematic video!

##### #Step1 Search for smoke effects

To add the smoke effect, click on the element's icon on the bar above and search for **smokescreen 2.**

##### #Step2 Add a smoke effect

Once you have searched and found the smoke screen 2 effects, then **import** that effect onto your timeline so that you can begin editing.

![adding smokescreen2 effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-4.gif)

Once you've added the fire effect, you will notice the change on the screen in the top right corner.

##### #Step3 Add duration

The next step would be to set the duration of the smokescreen effect so that it **matches the length of the video**. To do so,

* Click on the edge of the smoke screen effect.
* Drag it to the right if the effect appears **smaller** than the video clip.
* And drag it to the left if it is **larger** than the video clip.
* As soon as it matches the length of the video, leave the drag, and it will fit right into place.

##### #Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect

Once you have matched the duration of the smoke screen effect to the video clip, our next step would be to make some changes. These changes will make the **smokescreen appear more pleasing**—**double-click** on the smokescreen effect, which will open the transform menu.

We would first focus on the transform panel. Here you would have many options, but our focus would be on **rotation, scale, and position**.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** make sure to rotate the smoke screen effect by simply sliding the slider or dragging the slider right or left to your desire.

* You would have created an **angle** of the smokescreen to make it more natural.
* Now, we would have to adjust the **scale** of the smokescreen effect.
* Drag the slider to the right to expand the smoke to spread on the screen. It will help the smoke screen do appear more natural.
* You can adjust how much the smoke screen is visible on the screen by decreasing the opacity.

Adjust the slider to the **left** so it blends in with the flickering of the light we created. Now playback the video from the big screen to get an idea of the effect you added. And here are our parameters for reference.

![adjust the slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-5.jpg)

Cool, isn't it? Now we have added smoke to our timeline. Combined with the flickering light effect, we are closer to our goal.

##### Step4 Add flames or sparks

To mimic a real fire, we also have one more element that is missing, And that will be the **sparks and the flames**. And if you want to bring the fire effect of your video to the pro level, we would have to use the **film stock effects.** Flames and sparks are also available in the Wondershare Filmora.

##### #Step1 Search for Fire Tab

![search for fire tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-6.jpg)

* To do so, **click** on the bar above the element's icon.
* Once you have opened the elements tab, look to your **left** window, where further options are available.
* From these options, click on the **fire tab**.
* A new window will **pop up** in the library panel.

##### #Step2 Add the flame to the timeline

Click on a large scale **14** and drag it into your timeline above the smoke effect and the clip. Doing so would have created **two extra layers** after the video tab.

![adding flame effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-7.jpg)

##### #Step3 Adjust the flame effect

Now, we have to do steps similar to the ones above the first job. But first, you have to click on the edges of the effect. Then, match it to the length of your video.

Now, remember if the length of the effect is **more** than that of the video clip. You can adjust it by clicking on the edge and dragging it to the **left**. And if it appears to be **smaller** than the video clip, drag the edge to the **right** to match the length.

##### #Step4 Blend the video

When you look at the effect as you play the video from the start, you will notice that **the effect is a little more intense** than we want. To change it to your desires, you can follow the following steps.

* **First of all,** double-click and open the **transform**
* Experiment with the **rotation** and the **scale** and position; make your choice.
* Then move on to the compositing panel and focus on the **blending mode**.
* Here, you will notice a **drop-down panel** and select the screen option from all the other options.
* Doing so would help you blend the spark effect video much better.

If you focus on the spark effect that appears on the screen, you will notice that it seems to be much more intense than we require. If you want to blend it further, you can use **the opacity adjuster** and decrease the transparency. **Then, adjust** the slider till you feel it to be just right.

And the following are ideal parameters of our adjustment just for you to refer to.

This article will show you how to add camera shake to your videos using Adobe After Effects.

## Why Do We Need To Add A Camera Shake Effect To The Video?

Have you ever tried to add a simple camera shake effect to your videos? You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.

Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you're filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there's lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.

A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you're making a video that's meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that's supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:

* This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.
* Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they've seen similar videos before.
* Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.
* It's a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren't perfect humans, so we can't make perfect videos every time!"
* You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).
* You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer/audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.

## How to add camera shake to video in After Effects

When it comes to video editing, knowing how to make a layer shake in After Effects is a very useful skill. Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.

### Step 1\. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file

Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.

![camera shake effects for premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Step 2\. Press the alt/option key, then click the stopwatch next to "position."

You are adding an "expression" to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.

By pressing the alt/option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside "position" and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.

![use camera shake in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-2.jpg)

### Step 3\. Enter "Wiggle (3,8)" and adjust the settings accordingly

In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle -- basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The "Wiggle (10,3)" command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.

### Step 4\. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition

In order to make the overall effect more "choppy," you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition> Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as "8" if you want a choppy feel.

![how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg)

Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.

## Why Do We Need To Add A Camera Shake Effect To The Video?

Have you ever tried to add a simple camera shake effect to your videos? You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.

Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you're filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there's lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.

A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you're making a video that's meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that's supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:

* This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.
* Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they've seen similar videos before.
* Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.
* It's a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren't perfect humans, so we can't make perfect videos every time!"
* You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).
* You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer/audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.

## How to add camera shake to video in After Effects

When it comes to video editing, knowing how to make a layer shake in After Effects is a very useful skill. Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.

### Step 1\. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file

Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.

![camera shake effects for premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Step 2\. Press the alt/option key, then click the stopwatch next to "position."

You are adding an "expression" to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.

By pressing the alt/option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside "position" and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.

![use camera shake in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-2.jpg)

### Step 3\. Enter "Wiggle (3,8)" and adjust the settings accordingly

In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle -- basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The "Wiggle (10,3)" command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.

### Step 4\. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition

In order to make the overall effect more "choppy," you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition> Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as "8" if you want a choppy feel.

![how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg)

Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.

Step4 Extend the frozen frame and cut out the rest of the video.

![extend the frozen frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-7.png)

Step5 We are done with the first track so lock it.

![lock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-8.png)

Step6 Import the clip again on the second track. And find the sections of the clips where the subject is walking in the video. Cut the remaining part.

![import the clip on the second track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-9.gif)

Step7 It will create several small sections on the second track.

![second track sections](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-10.png)

Step8 Put the first clip at the start of the timeline and move the playhead to find the frame containing enough room for the second outfit.

![put the first outfit clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-11.gif)

Step9 Move the second outfit to that playhead area.

![put the second outfit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-12.gif)

Step10 Double-click on the clip, go to effects, and choose a single-line mask.

![choose single line mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-13.gif)

Step11 Drag the mask to the point where it shows the outfit on its right side.

![drag the mask line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-14.gif)

Step12 Blur the mask edges by increasing blur numbers.

![blur the mask edges](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-15.gif)

Step13 Click on the add button to add a mask keyframe and move the play head forward until the first outfit leaves the frame.

![add a mask keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-16.gif)

Step14 Move the mask to the left to reveal the entire frame, and repeat the same process with all outfits.

![reveal the frame and repeat with all outfits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-17.gif)

Step15 After finishing all outfits, copy the clip from the first outfit. And paste it on top of all the tracks after the last outfit. And add a mask keyframe to this section too.

![add a mask frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-18.gif)

Step16 Unlock the first track and move the playhead to find the point where the subject with 4th outfit moves out of the frame. Then, cut the remaining part of the freeze frame on the right.

![unlock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-19.gif)

Step17 Now move the playhead to the first frame and find where it coincides with the last part of the final frame. Cut the previous piece.

![move playhead to first frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-20.gif)

Post it on Instagram, and it will keep playing automatically and act like a loop video. Otherwise, duplicate this edited clip several times to create a longer loop video. Background music plays a vital role in these videos, setting the tone and pace. Follow all the steps in the correct order. Then, create and post loop videos on your social media platforms.

Birthdays come only once a year, and at this time of the year, we want to make our loved ones feel special and loved by praying for them, wishing them well, getting them presents, throwing parties, and other stuff people do to celebrate birthdays.

A **birthday slideshow** combines several images in a chosen software program. But it is not the only thing that makes a fantastic **birthday photo slideshow.** This amazing slideshow doesn't have to be just photos, and you can also create a **birthday wishes slideshow**. For a lasting impression on the celebrant, consider adding these when you **create a birthday slideshow.** A birthday slideshow should have the following:

**●** Background music

Lighten up your video with some background music. A slideshow just displaying photos without music isn't a good idea.

**●** Meaningful Quotes and greetings

You can spice up the birthday video by adding greetings, quotes, and well wishes to let the celebrant know you want to them feel fantastic.

**●** Make the video personal

Add a personal touch to the clip by adding things that matter to the celebrant, whether pictures of them taken while performing a hobby or a favorite place. You can also use photos of their achievements from the time of their last birthday to the present one.

**●** Keep it short and simple

You don't want to drag your audience with too many photos. I think the video would have the most impact when it is short, to the point, and keeps the viewers longing for more.

## Final Cut Pro for iPad- Is It Available?

Final Cut Pro by Apple is the most popular premium video editor among macOS users. Starting from social media videos to short films and movies, Final Cut Pro is a popular choice. Even though video editing using FCP is mostly done on Mac, there are many who prefer video editing on their powerful phones. It is quite shocking that Final Cut Pro for Android and iOS users is not yet available.

Since it is an Apple-exclusive application, you would have expected FCP mobile app for iPhone and iPad. But Apple is yet to develop a mobile app for Final Cut Pro.

## Part 1\. Final Cut Pro Alternative App for Android

There is no Final Cut Pro app available for Android users. It is not surprising because Final Cut Pro is an Apple product. When you search for Final Cut Pro on Play Store, you will come across an FCP app. But it is a fake app and not developed by Apple. Here is our recommendation of the best Final Cut Pro alternative app for Android users.

### 1\. Filmora

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the best alternative to Final Cut Pro for Android users. The app has a super high rating on Play Store. Filmora is available for free and you can create amazing HD videos. You can add stunning effects, animations, texts, filters, backgrounds, and much more. You can obviously perform the basic video edits such as trim, cut, join, and likewise. The app allows easy sharing of edited videos on social media platforms.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step 2: Setup the Footage Speed

To adjust the speed, drag the video clip into the timeline by clicking twice, and then slide the speed tool to the desired speed for your time-lapse. The speed is changed to be 100 times faster.

Step 3: Render the Timelapse

The Render Timeline button is recognized by the window's preview when you click it to guarantee the speed changes your clip has to be adjusted to. You would take off the audio that was in the original video. Utilizing the image's visible volume tool button, change the volume and then render it again by hitting the render icon as shown here:

Step 4: Edit the Video

To change the perspective of the video to wherever you want it, click right on the video clip on the timeline and choose Crop & Zoom, followed by Pan & Zoom. Additionally, you may add text using the text and title tool that is already built-in, add music using royalty-free music files or apply filters and other features.

Step 5: Share your Timelapse

As you can see, you can drag and drop the pre-built templates from the library onto the timeline. Next, click the Export button at the top to start exporting. The Filmora's features include support for 4K editing, GIF compatibility, noise reduction, color tuning, a sophisticated text editor, an audio mixer, video stabilization, scene identification, and audio equalization.

## Conclusion

Time-lapse is the video editing technique in that the speed is lower and the frequency of video and picture. A time-lapse software, Filmora is a video editor that lets you create a smooth time-lapse where time appears to be passing quickly. This app is very helpful to create the video on time-lapse, making the appearance in the series of quick succession about a long term or period to denote something that happens over a long period.

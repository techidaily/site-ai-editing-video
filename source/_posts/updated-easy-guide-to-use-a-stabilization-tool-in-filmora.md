## Easy Guide to Use a Stabilization Tool in Filmora

Does your video shake so much? Shaking movement on your camera is often inevitable, especially if you don't use a camera stabilizer or a camera with no built-in image stabilization. As a result, it can make your video look distracting and difficult to watch.

But you don't need to worry. You can use a stabilization tool in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). A stabilization tool is a feature that can help to correct for camera shake and other types of movement. If you are a handheld shooter, you will find this tool extremely helpful.

## Part 1: When do you need to stabilize your video?

Now, let's talk about when you should stabilize your video. If you're shooting something that is moving, like people or animals, you will definitely want to stabilize your video. This will help ensure that the video is smooth and steady.

Another time you may want to stabilize your video is if you're shooting in a low-light situation. It will help to ensure that your video is not too shaky.

Finally, if you're shooting a video that's going to be displayed on a large screen, you may want to stabilize your video. Stabilizing your video will help ensure the output is crisp and clear.

## Part 2: How to stabilize your video with Filmora

Filmora has a stabilization feature that can help to smooth your video and make it look more professional. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can download it for free.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

So, should you have a wobble movement in your video, follow these steps to make it smoother in no time:

Step1 Launch Filmora 11 and **create a new project**.

Step2 Import your video to Filmora.

![import your video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Step3 After you import your video to Filmora, the Stabilization must have been off. So, **switch the Stabilization toggle on**, then a loading bar will start going up to analyze the clip.

![switch the stabilization toggle on](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-2.jpg)

Step4 Once it finishes analyzing, the smooth level will default to 10\. See the preview whether you like how it turns out.

**Before**

![before finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-3.gif)

**After**

![after finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-4.gif)

Please note that the center point of your image will always be the most stable. The more shaky a clip is, the more it will crop into that image.

If you are unsatisfied with the default setting, increasing the Smoothness Level will result in more cropping to the image. On the contrary, if you put the Smoothness Level down to zero, you are no longer cropping into the image, but the result won't be as smooth.

![adjust smothness level as byou like](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-5.gif)

Should the cropping bother you, such as it crops the subject's hair out of the frame, you can adjust it with **Edge Processing**.

If you change it to **None**, you will see the black bars that simulate how it stabilizes the clip. Try to hit play on the preview screen, and then you can see more clearly how the tool keeps the center of the frame to make it stable and less shaky.

![hit play on the preview screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-6.gif)

As **Reflect** is the default, the **Extend** uses artificial intelligence to extend the pixels, as you are often aware in Photoshop.

![extend the pixels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-7.jpg)

Besides the three, there is also the **Tile** option. Each of them would give a different result. You can try and use the one that works best for you.

## Summary

When you're shooting a video, you must have wanted it to be as smooth and stable as possible. By stabilizing your video, you can help ensure it's smooth and easy to watch.

Filmora offers a Stabilization feature that allows you to easily improve your video's quality. Simply select the video clip you want to stabilize and click the stabilization button. Filmora will do the rest, giving you a smooth and stable video.

## How to Correct Lens Distortion in Videos

The distortion in your video may irritate you when you're working on the video's edit. When you take images or record sound, you frequently end up with distorted results due to lens distortion. In this article, we will discuss what lens distortion is, how it may be fixed, and the factors you need to pay attention to avoid lens distortion when taking or recording videos.

## Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion

**1\. What is lens distortion**

Distortion means that the straight rectilinear projection is not straight. In the pinhole camera model, lens distortion is measured by how far from the image's ideal projection is. From a geometric optics point of view, the scene's straight lines don't look straight in the image.

When you take a picture, the camera lens can somehow change the shape of the image. It is called camera lens distortion. In simple terms, we can tell you that this is the case because distortion in-camera is when the lens makes curved lines in an image and doesn't show the straight lines from the scene.

**2\. What cause it**

Lens distortion happens with all lenses. It is because of several things, such as how the lens is curved, how far away the subject is, and the angle at which the photo was taken. Furthermore, it changes the image in many ways, but you can see it most when straight lines at the frame's edges are no longer parallel.

Most geometric lens distortions happen when the focal distance is short (barrel distortion), long (pincushion distortion), or when a fish-eye lens is used to take a picture from a low angle (keystone distortion).

## Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?

A lot of times, with lower-end wide-angle lenses, especially action cams like GoPro, you get pretty gnarly distortion when you're filming. As we know, the Earth is round, but it shouldn't look like this when you take a picture. Indeed, it's very distorted, it has the horizon line bending all over the place, and basically, all of the lines in the video have some level of curvature.

Hence, follow all the steps below to know how to fix it:

Step1 Import your video to [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![import your video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-1.jpg)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the "Camera model" based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7\. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.

![click on the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-2.jpg)

Step3 To adjust the distortion, you can slide the bar to the left or the right. If you slide the bar to the right (maximum level), there will be no adjustment. However, if you slide the bar to the left, you can see it pulling those lines as high up as possible.

You can see a bit of curvature, but it looks much more natural, and all of the lines in the video look so much better.

![adjust the distortion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-3.gif)

Step4 Lastly, if you play the video back, you will see the video look much better than before.

![play the video back](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-4.gif)

## Part 3: How to avoid distorted lens while shooting?

**1\. Avoid very wide-angle lenses**

The more distortion there is in a lens, like a 15mm prime, the wider it is. Sometimes you need a very wide-angle lens, and distortion is unavoidable. If you have room to move back, you could try using a lens with a different focal length.

**2\. Avoid getting too close**

Doing so will enhance optical distortion in many lenses and the likelihood of perspective distortion in all lenses.

**3\. Be mindful of your composition**

There are numerous instances where distortion is acceptable or even intended. Others must be carefully examined, such as utilizing a wide-angle lens to photograph a row of people. When you get too close to a group, the distortion makes the people at each end appear considerably wider! Therefore, consider your composition. Stand back and add space around your group; if necessary, you can trim the image afterward.

**4\. Use a 50mm lens**

50mm lenses are often called "all-purpose" lenses. There is a good reason

for this. A 50mm lens is great for portraits, street photography, and many other kinds of photography, including architecture. If your subject is big, you just need space to stand back. You will see that a 50mm lens rarely distorts the image.

Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the "Camera model" based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7\. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

Double click on the video on the timeline to select it. Then, navigate to the top left panel and click on the Color tab.

### Step 4\. Create Your LUT

Under the Color tab, choose the '3D LUT' in Basic to customize your own LUTs.

![select 3d lut in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/select-3d-lut.png)

Since you're creating your own LUT instead of using the pre-built LUTs, scroll down to adjust various things, such as the White Balance, Color, Light, HSL, and Vignette.

![adjust setting to create lut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-your-own-lut.png)

Tweak these settings until you’re satisfied with the results. To help you make the adjustments and balance the intensity of the colors in your footage, check the color histogram located at the top right corner of the window.

###

### Step 5\. Save Your LUT

If you’re satisfied with the results, click on the ![save lut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/save-icon-in-filmora.jpg) Save button locate in the menu bar.

You’ll need to name and save your LUT in the new window that opens. Give your LUT a descriptive name and click on OK to save it.

And that’s it! You’ve successfully created your own LUT.

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

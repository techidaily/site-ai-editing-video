With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.

This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his/her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.

### 05Training on Depth Prediction

YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that **Google’s AI YouTube** researchers used the "mannequin challenge" to understand depth predictions.

In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).

### 06Tackle Fake News

Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.

YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.

## Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?

![youtube recommendation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-learning-ai-marketing-youtube-3.jpg)

YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.

YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.

YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his/her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.

YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.

YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016\. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the "borderline content".

Let us discuss how to add background to green screen are pretty simple using Filmora.

##### Step1 Add Overlay clip to timeline

Select “Create New Project” to start the editing. At first, you have to choose both the overlay clip and background clip and add them to the timeline. You can either import from the library or drag the files to the timeline in the positions shown in the picture.

You can edit the overlay clip individually by adding animation, effects, filterers, mask frame, and blending modes (multiply, darken, or color burn). Let us move to the next step, how to put the background on the green screen.

##### Step2 Make a Green Screen

Let’s get into the first step to add background to the green screen video. In this part, you will be using a green screen to remove the background. So, import the green screen clips to the media library. Now, add the background green screen to the timeline above the video track as shown in the picture.

![import green screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/place-green-screen-background-videos.jpg)

● Move the cursor to the green screen on the timeline and double-click on it.

● The settings box will appear on the left.

● You have to tick the Chroma key there.

The green screen effects will be applied automatically.

The video can be refined with many additional tools like Tolerance, Offset, and Alpha channel to make the video background clear. Once satisfied with the results, click on OK. Now that we have discussed how to add background to green screen video with the help of Filmora let’s now discuss how to add a background to a video without a green screen.

## Part 2 Add background to video without a green screen

Let us learn how to add a background to a video without a green screen. In Filmora, there is a special effect called the Human segmentation effect to isolate people from the backgrounds without a green screen. All it takes is a few clicks. Once you remove the surround, you can add an image or a video clip to go well with your original video. Another unique feature is that after removing the background from the video clip, you can add it to the overlay of another video clip. It works well when it has a natural and single person in front of the camera.

Let’s discuss how to add background without a green screen.

While it may look complicated, it's actually quite easy to create with a video editing program like Filmora. Filmora's masking feature allows users to create impressive and eye-catching text reveals in their videos. For those looking for a tutorial on how to make text reveal, here's a step-by-step guide to help you out.

##### Step 1 Add video tracks

![import the clip to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-2.jpg)

##### Step 3 Make a cut at the beginning of the text

Find the spot where you want the text reveals to start, then click the scissor icon to make a cut on the clip from the first video track.

![make a cut at the beginning of the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-3.jpg)

##### Step 4 Add and adjust the text

Go to Title > Plain Text > select which text styles suit you best. Then, drag the title to the second video track.

![add and adjust the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-4.jpg)

![double-click on each of the smaller clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-8.jpg)

Since the subject in this tutorial is moving from side to side, we are going to match the mask's y-axis setting, which is also the revealed text portion, with the subject's movement. Starting from the first clip, adjust the y-axis number to a smaller/bigger number.

## A Comprehensive Guide on VHS Technology and Its Influence on Video Editing

Videos are a person's crucial and cherished memory, and no one wants to compromise their quality. People tend to rely on several effects to exceed the quality of the beloved videos. VHS is the most used effect, popular in professional and personal videos. It stands for “Video Home System” and is often integrated with noises, color bleeding, and smooth glitches.

With **VHS-style** videos, you can not only make videos more high-class but can also intuitively define their worth. If you are new to this field, you should get familiar with the VHS effects in video. This context will provide basic information about **VHS tapes** and how to add VHS effects to videos.

## Part 1: What Is VHS Technology? An Overview of the 70s Sensation

From definition to usability, every piece of information plays an important role in your videography journey. Don't worry if you don't have video editing skills or know what **VHS means**. This section will provide you with reliable information about this:

### What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?

VHS, also known as Video Home System, are the auditory artifacts and visual glitches you see in the pictures. It creates a sense of distortion in the video, making the viewer think the camera equipment is malfunctioning. From the 1980s to the 1990s, this effect gained considerable popularity among video creators and viewers.

In recent years, retro lovers have brought this intuitive effect again into a trend to create a perfect flashback scene. The nostalgic and vintage appeal of these effects is insane. VHS is not just one effect because it divides into further categories. You are also free to select the VHS effects according to the theme of your video and the scene you are going to create.

### Key Aspects of The VHS Effects

Several key aspects are crucial to making high-quality VHS effects in the videos. You can see some of the key aspects listed and discussed here:

* **Tracking Lines of VHS:**The **VHS tapes** are integrated with magnetic strips to sort audio and video signals. However, over time, these tapes degraded, leading to glitches in playback with noticeable distortion.
* **Video Color Bleeding:**You must have noticed that color is bleeding in the VHS videos. In this, the colors in the videos are quite smudged and mixed. This together adds the unique yet smoother distortion in the videos.
* **Vintage and Glitching:**Vintage and glitches are essential to videos with VHS effects. This was initially caused by the limitations of playback equipment and signal interference. At this time, people add **glitch VHS** to the videos in a manual manner to add a sense of interference in the scene.
* **Noise and Jitters:**VHS tapes are known to be susceptible to wrappings and jitters. It causes a slightly unstable effect in the videos in the form of distorted objects. Moreover, the grainy and noisy appearance due to analog recording technology is also a part of this effect.

## How to Add Miniature Effect in Video with Filmora

Want to add selective blur to make everything look smaller? Don't have any idea how to focus on specific mini-things? Then don't worry! In this article, you'll get a step-by-step process to add miniature effects to your video. At the end of the process, you'll have cinematic shots. Then start with us now! Scroll more to get pro tips!

## What Is a Miniature Effect?

![after adding a miniature effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-1.jpg)

But first, let's learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.

However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we're seeing is actually a tiny model.

![a miniature effect for landscape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg)

To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:

* It utilizes **selective blur** to make things appear like **small**
* The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from **a high angle**.
* The tiny effect is usually used in **drone footage, time lapses**, or **landscape photography**.

Are you all set to add miniature effects to your video and make film-like shots? Then scroll more and get the step-by-step process.

##### Step3 Head to the effect panel

As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a **Blur** effect on the video.

![search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-5.gif)

To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:

* **First, drag** and **Drop** the effect toward the timeline.

![add effect on the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-6.gif)

##### Step7 Add masks on the Video

Now, it's time to select a specific video portion and add a mask. Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:

* **Double-click** on the video present in 2nd track.
* The settings tab will be open in the top left section.
* Then find the **Mask** section and click on it.
* After this, **click** on the **Double-line**.
* Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.

Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!

![rotation of mask in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif)

For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can't get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:

![blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif)

* Make a building or any object **Blurry** near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.
* While the **object is far** from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.
* Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.

Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:

![changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif)

* Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.
* **Settings** will activate on the top left side.
* Then click on the **Mask** tab to open it.
* Select the **Rectangular** mask from the list and apply it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.

Now, it's time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:

* Add the same stock video clip a **third time** on the third video track of the timeline.
* Then add a mask in a **Rectangle** shape on the building.
* Don't **blur** the edge of this mask.

![mask the object far from the camera for the main focus](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-13.gif)

##### Step8 Final Look

* The **latest version** has an unlimited stock library.
* After purchasing any plan, you can access **Stock Media** (Unsplash, Giphy, Pixabay, Pixel).

##### Step3 Head to the effect panel

As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a **Blur** effect on the video.

![search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-5.gif)

To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:

* First of all, move toward the above tabs.
* Then click on the 5th section, which is **Effect**
* After selecting the effect tab, a new window will **pop up**.
* In this section, we have **500+** different effects.
* Then, **click** on the search bar.
* **Search** for the Blur effect.
* After that, click on the **Blur 2**
* Then **Download** this effect if you haven't done this already.

##### Step4 Add the blur effect to the video

After selecting and downloading the blur effect, it's time to add it to the video. Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:

* **First, drag** and **Drop** the effect toward the timeline.
* Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.

![add effect on the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-6.gif)

##### Step5 Add the effect multiple times

Want to get an ideal blur level? If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:

* First, ensure that the **opacity** of the blur effect is 100%.
* Then, if you still want more blurriness, add **Blur 2** effect multiple times on the video.
* Finally, add effect by just the **Drag and Drop**

![add blur effect in video multiple times](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-7.gif)

##### Step6 Drop the same video clip

* Add the same video clip 2nd time on the timeline.
* Add it by just the **Drag and Drop**
* Make sure you add it to 2nd video track in the timeline above the first one.

![add the same video for 2nd time on the timeline in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-8.gif)

##### Step7 Add masks on the Video

Now, it's time to select a specific video portion and add a mask. Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:

* **Double-click** on the video present in 2nd track.
* The settings tab will be open in the top left section.
* Then find the **Mask** section and click on it.
* After this, **click** on the **Double-line**.
* Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.

![add mask to the video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-9.gif)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.

Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!

![rotation of mask in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif)

For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can't get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:

![blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif)

* Make a building or any object **Blurry** near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.
* While the **object is far** from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.
* Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.

Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:

![changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif)

* Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.
* **Settings** will activate on the top left side.
* Then click on the **Mask** tab to open it.
* Select the **Rectangular** mask from the list and apply it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.

Now, it's time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:

* Add the same stock video clip a **third time** on the third video track of the timeline.
* Then add a mask in a **Rectangle** shape on the building.
* Don't **blur** the edge of this mask.

![mask the object far from the camera for the main focus](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-13.gif)

##### Step8 Final Look

You are excited now to see the final look of your miniature effect! Finally, it's in front of you! Just modify it more if you want to make it more precise.

![final look of miniature effect on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-14.gif)

## **Pro-Tips:**

The market is flooded with AI-powered speech generation software. Many alternatives are available, so selecting the ideal voice generator might be difficult. Here are a few pieces of stuff to consider when deciding what software to look for:

* The Voice Generator should be simple to use and understand.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Does AI manufacture voices?**

Yes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a wide range of varied voices that seem pretty natural. Today, several advanced tools employ genuine voice actors whose voices are collected and retained using artificial intelligence.

These voices have permission to say whatever you want them to. All you have to do is enter some text into the tool. The AI will read the text and provide a natural-sounding voice with clear audio.

### **What Does a Voice Overlay Imply?**

Voice overlay, or Voice-Over, is a form of a production technique that is often employed in films and animation material.

In tv news, radios, movies, and other mediums, it is a method in which a pre-recorded voice-over that is not part of the story is used. It's a method usually reserved for the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to giving animated figures a voice.

### **How Can You Improve the Quality of Your Voice When Recording?**

You can improve the sound of your voice by implementing one or more of the following methods:

* Use the proper microphone and position it near your mouth as feasible.
* Make use of a high-quality voice recorder.
* Record your audio in a sound-proofed environment.
* Drink plenty of water to keep your speech clear.

### **Is Lovo for free?**

Lovo Studio's AI-powered voice cloning technology will amaze you if you seek a free AI Voice Generator. Although Lovo is a premium voice generator, it still has a free version that is quite useful. The unpaid version, on the other hand, has some limits.

For example, the free version allows for three monthly downloads and three days of premium voice access and is restricted to personal use. Lovo's free version will suffice if you don't mind the limitations.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Does AI manufacture voices?**

Yes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a wide range of varied voices that seem pretty natural. Today, several advanced tools employ genuine voice actors whose voices are collected and retained using artificial intelligence.

These voices have permission to say whatever you want them to. All you have to do is enter some text into the tool. The AI will read the text and provide a natural-sounding voice with clear audio.

### **What Does a Voice Overlay Imply?**

Voice overlay, or Voice-Over, is a form of a production technique that is often employed in films and animation material.

In tv news, radios, movies, and other mediums, it is a method in which a pre-recorded voice-over that is not part of the story is used. It's a method usually reserved for the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to giving animated figures a voice.

### **How Can You Improve the Quality of Your Voice When Recording?**

You can improve the sound of your voice by implementing one or more of the following methods:

* Use the proper microphone and position it near your mouth as feasible.
* Make use of a high-quality voice recorder.
* Record your audio in a sound-proofed environment.
* Drink plenty of water to keep your speech clear.

### **Is Lovo for free?**

Lovo Studio's AI-powered voice cloning technology will amaze you if you seek a free AI Voice Generator. Although Lovo is a premium voice generator, it still has a free version that is quite useful. The unpaid version, on the other hand, has some limits.

For example, the free version allows for three monthly downloads and three days of premium voice access and is restricted to personal use. Lovo's free version will suffice if you don't mind the limitations.

## **Pro-Tips:**

The market is flooded with AI-powered speech generation software. Many alternatives are available, so selecting the ideal voice generator might be difficult. Here are a few pieces of stuff to consider when deciding what software to look for:

* The Voice Generator should be simple to use and understand.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Does AI manufacture voices?**

Yes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a wide range of varied voices that seem pretty natural. Today, several advanced tools employ genuine voice actors whose voices are collected and retained using artificial intelligence.

These voices have permission to say whatever you want them to. All you have to do is enter some text into the tool. The AI will read the text and provide a natural-sounding voice with clear audio.

### **What Does a Voice Overlay Imply?**

Voice overlay, or Voice-Over, is a form of a production technique that is often employed in films and animation material.

In tv news, radios, movies, and other mediums, it is a method in which a pre-recorded voice-over that is not part of the story is used. It's a method usually reserved for the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to giving animated figures a voice.

### **How Can You Improve the Quality of Your Voice When Recording?**

You can improve the sound of your voice by implementing one or more of the following methods:

* Use the proper microphone and position it near your mouth as feasible.
* Make use of a high-quality voice recorder.
* Record your audio in a sound-proofed environment.
* Drink plenty of water to keep your speech clear.

### **Is Lovo for free?**

Lovo Studio's AI-powered voice cloning technology will amaze you if you seek a free AI Voice Generator. Although Lovo is a premium voice generator, it still has a free version that is quite useful. The unpaid version, on the other hand, has some limits.

For example, the free version allows for three monthly downloads and three days of premium voice access and is restricted to personal use. Lovo's free version will suffice if you don't mind the limitations.

## **Pro-Tips:**

The market is flooded with AI-powered speech generation software. Many alternatives are available, so selecting the ideal voice generator might be difficult. Here are a few pieces of stuff to consider when deciding what software to look for:

* The Voice Generator should be simple to use and understand.
* Without seeming robotic, the synthesized voice must sound as realistic as feasible.
* It should provide you access to a large number of high-quality AI voices.
* Text-to-speech conversion should be smooth, with all words correctly spoken.
* It should allow for easy modification.
* Grammar assistance is quite beneficial.
* Finally, the product should be inexpensive, particularly for small businesses.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Does AI manufacture voices?**

Yes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a wide range of varied voices that seem pretty natural. Today, several advanced tools employ genuine voice actors whose voices are collected and retained using artificial intelligence.

These voices have permission to say whatever you want them to. All you have to do is enter some text into the tool. The AI will read the text and provide a natural-sounding voice with clear audio.

### **What Does a Voice Overlay Imply?**

Voice overlay, or Voice-Over, is a form of a production technique that is often employed in films and animation material.

In tv news, radios, movies, and other mediums, it is a method in which a pre-recorded voice-over that is not part of the story is used. It's a method usually reserved for the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to giving animated figures a voice.

### **How Can You Improve the Quality of Your Voice When Recording?**

You can improve the sound of your voice by implementing one or more of the following methods:

* Use the proper microphone and position it near your mouth as feasible.
* Make use of a high-quality voice recorder.
* Record your audio in a sound-proofed environment.
* Drink plenty of water to keep your speech clear.

### **Is Lovo for free?**

Lovo Studio's AI-powered voice cloning technology will amaze you if you seek a free AI Voice Generator. Although Lovo is a premium voice generator, it still has a free version that is quite useful. The unpaid version, on the other hand, has some limits.

For example, the free version allows for three monthly downloads and three days of premium voice access and is restricted to personal use. Lovo's free version will suffice if you don't mind the limitations.

### **What Are The Best Text to Robot Voice Generators?**

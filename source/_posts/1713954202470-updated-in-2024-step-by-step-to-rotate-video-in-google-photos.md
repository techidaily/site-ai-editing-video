## Way 2\. Use Twitch To Save Your Streams

Twitch is the most popular and best live streaming platform that allows gamers to broadcast their gameplay to a live audience and also gives them the ability to save their past broadcasts, or **"streams."**

This feature can be useful to save your live stream for later viewing or share your stream with someone who missed it.

### Features

Twitch offers a variety of features that make it a unique and powerful game streaming platform. Some of the most notable ones are:

* **Live streaming:** Twitch allows gamers to share their gameplay in real-time with other gamers around the world. This live aspect of the platform makes it unique and engaging.
* **Social interaction:** Twitch offers a variety of features that allow gamers to connect with each other, including chat rooms, forums, and user-generated content.

**You can save your stream on Twitch in two ways:**

* Use the **"Highlights"** feature, which allows you to save specific moments from your live stream.
* Download your stream's entire **VOD** (video on demand) after it has ended.

### Steps

Here are the quick steps to saving a stream on your PC from Twitch. But first, you need to enable Twitch VODs before starting your broadcast in the following way:

Step1 Visit [**Twitch**](https://www.twitch.tv/) and sign in to your account. Now, click the **"Profile"** icons and go to **"Creator Dashboard."**

Step2 Head to **Setting** from the left-sidebar and click the **"Stream"** option. Scroll down and find the VOD Settings. Toggle the buttons next to **"Store Past Broadcasts."**

Step3 To publish your VODs instantly after broadcasting, toggle the button next to **"Always Publish VODs."**

Now, to download the recordings of your broadcasts to your PC, do the following steps in sequence:

Step1 Head to the [**Creator Dashboard,**](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/) find the **"Content"** section in the left sidebar, and click **"Video Producer."**

Step2 Find the stream (VOD or Highlights) you want to download and on the right side, click the three dots.

Step3 Finally, click the **"Download"** option and let Twitch prepare your video. You will then get the stream's recording in MP4 format.

## Way 3\. Use Screen Recorder To Record Your Streams

Using a screen recorder is a great way to record your live stream because it lets you capture the full screen of your PC. Although there are many different screen recorders to choose from, we recommend using Filmora.

[**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a powerful editor with easy-to-use screen recording capabilities, giving you everything you need to **record and stream your video at the same time.** The software is free to use and has an intuitive interface.

### Features of Filmora

### Steps

Here's how to use Filmora for recording while streaming:

Step2 Launch **Filmora 11** and click **"New project"** in the main interface. Click **"File"** from the top toolbar and scroll down to **"Record media**." From the drop-down menu, select **"Record PC Screen."**

Step4 Click the **Start** icon to begin your recording. Afterward, click the **Stop** icon to stop the recording, and your stream will be saved in the selected destination.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've discussed three step-by-step methods to help you do **live streaming and recording** at the same time. With these solutions at your disposal, you'll be able to save your VODs with ease.

It is best to choose only one software to start with to avoid the time-consuming trial-and-error process. If you want to add another tool, do so later; otherwise, you will waste your precious time and resources.

Give these methods a shot, and eventually, you will find your groove—and become accustomed to just how easy it is to record and stream a video simultaneously.

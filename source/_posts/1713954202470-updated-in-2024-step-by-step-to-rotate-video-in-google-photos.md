Google photos let you store, view, edit and share your videos and photos and are automatically organized. It is a very great cloud storage service and most people use it. Google Photos has introduced an artificial intelligence technology into the app. That’s why it can automatically organize and rotate.

You have videos on google photos that are automatically rotated, others are not.

How do you rotate them manually?

It’s is so simple and will not take much of your time.

Let’s dive in…

You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you're going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.

## Way 3\. Use Screen Recorder To Record Your Streams

Using a screen recorder is a great way to record your live stream because it lets you capture the full screen of your PC. Although there are many different screen recorders to choose from, we recommend using Filmora.

[**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a powerful editor with easy-to-use screen recording capabilities, giving you everything you need to **record and stream your video at the same time.** The software is free to use and has an intuitive interface.

### Features of Filmora

* Support for both Mac OS X and Windows operating systems.
* Ability to record your PC screen, audio, and webcam all at once
* A variety of video editing features
* An easy-to-use interface

### Steps

Here's how to use Filmora for recording while streaming:

Step1 Head to the official [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) website, download the software and install it on your PC.

Step2 Launch **Filmora 11** and click **"New project"** in the main interface. Click **"File"** from the top toolbar and scroll down to **"Record media**." From the drop-down menu, select **"Record PC Screen."**

Step4 Click the **Start** icon to begin your recording. Afterward, click the **Stop** icon to stop the recording, and your stream will be saved in the selected destination.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've discussed three step-by-step methods to help you do **live streaming and recording** at the same time. With these solutions at your disposal, you'll be able to save your VODs with ease.

It is best to choose only one software to start with to avoid the time-consuming trial-and-error process. If you want to add another tool, do so later; otherwise, you will waste your precious time and resources.

Give these methods a shot, and eventually, you will find your groove—and become accustomed to just how easy it is to record and stream a video simultaneously.

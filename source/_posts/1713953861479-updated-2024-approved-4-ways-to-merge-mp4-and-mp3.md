Step 3: Click 'Add media' and drag and drop your films, audio, and photographs into the media box if you already have filmed footage you'd like to utilize in your project. You may also add media by clicking 'Browse my files.' If you wish to use free stock footage, go to 'Stock' and upload your films to the project by clicking the '+' button. All your films will be saved in your library.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-14.jpg)

Step 4: You can now find your videos in your media library. Drag and drop the picture-in-picture videos you want to alter to the editing timeline. As shown in the sample below, arrange the two videos one over the other. Make sure both clips are precisely underneath one another.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-15.jpg)

Step 5: Now that your movies are aligned, select the one you want to shrink. The video you're reducing must be at the top of the screen. To move it from the bottom to the top, drag and drop it. A small box will appear on the timeline in the bottom left corner of the clip. The clip will shrink when you click the box once. When you click the box once again, modifying choices will appear. You can move the smaller video around and increase or decrease its size.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-16.jpg)

Step 6: Export your project once you've completed editing your video. Save to your preferred place or folder. You can share the video straight on social media or embed it in a document.

## Camtasia Vs Captivate - Which to Choose?

Being a video editor, itâ€™s critical to keep ahead of the curve in our fast-changing global world. From small enterprises to major corporations, eLearning applications have shown to be a significant tool for cutting expenses and increasing profits. Software like Camtasia and Captivate are in high demand as e-learning becomes a more vital aspect of our life. When it comes to creating a course or video instruction, these two applications are quite quick and useful. Whether you should choose a Camtasia or a Captivate relies entirely on your industry and what you want to accomplish with this application.

Often times between Camtasia vs Captivate, the question arises: "Which software is superior?" As a result, we've compared Camtasia and Captivate based on the software packages themselves, as well as some important features, similarities, and differences. Software stimulation, production, demonstration screencasts, and translation of PowerPoint presentations into various formats are all possible using TechSmith Camtasia and Adobe Captivate. Camtasia offers fewer online learning alternatives, but it boasts incredible screen and video capture, as well as video editing facilities. This application allows you to alter the sound and visual characteristics manually. Video artists may improve video quality by using auxiliary microphones and cameras. The editing of the video is Camtasia's most impressive function. It allows you to cut and paste films, add transitions and subtitles to them, as well as do color grading and color correction.

## Part 1\. Overall Comparison

Each piece of software may be used to create eLearning and lesson material. Despite the fact that Adobe Captivate offers amazing transitional features and visual effect tools, it does not include video editing, which is, in my view, the backbone of developing eLearning material that adheres to the learning management system. As a result, Adobe Captivate needs the use of Adobe Premiere to edit and correct any problems in your films. Adobe Captivate, on the other hand, is the greatest alternative for developing quality eLearning and lesson software material. It's an excellent tool for developing online courses and tutorials. However, as previously said, Adobe Captivate is not simple to use and is not recommended for novices. Camtasia, on the other hand, seems to be the most economical and practical alternative for you based on your abilities if you are an entry-level editor and want to master the fundamentals of video editing and lesson production on your own.

## Part 3\. Adobe Captivate Review

Captivate is an Adobe tool designed to make online learning more engaging and interactive. Students save time since they can take their classes with them. Captivate has no built-in video editing tools. To do so, you'll need to use additional Adobe applications. Captivate allows students to study at any time and from any location. However, if you're the one creating the course, Adobe Captivate could be a little frightening since it requires Adobe experience to utilize.

## Conclusion

Camtasia's technique of making a presentation using an individual movie works well for developers who are knowledgeable with video applications. Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that userâ€™s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.

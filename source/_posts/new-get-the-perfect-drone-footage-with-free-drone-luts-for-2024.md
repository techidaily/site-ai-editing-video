## Part 1: What is the Adjustment Layer in After Effects?

The adjustment layer can save you time and energy from adding effects to multiple clips individually. It does not alter the composition of your video clip until you start applying the effects. Once you add the effect in the adjustment layer, it will replace the effect on all the layers under it.

You can add the adjustment layers in your timeline for creating visual effects such as film grain or color grading. Using the adjustment layer, you can produce transition effects by adding effects to shorter compositions. However, if you want to use the adjustment layer properly, you should select its position carefully in the layer’s stack.

![adjustment layer in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/adjustment-layers-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

Moreover, always keep in mind that anything placed under the adjustment layer will have a direct effect. In contrast, anything above the adjustment layer won’t get affected. Hence, you can use adjustment layers in After Effects for your convenience to apply all kinds of effects from color to distortion.

## Easily Sync Audio With Video With Filmora

Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it's not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

That's why in this brief guide, we'll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio & video when a single camera can record both. So let's first answer this simple question.

## Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio & Video?

Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can't expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That's why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.

You might think it's an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.

![recording audio and video separately for higher quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg)

But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don't do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn't it?

Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let's first see what preparations we need. After that, we'll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let's begin our journey.

## Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording

You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It's to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.

And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.

![a clapper board used to start a film scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/film-start-clapper-board.jpg)

Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It's best to clap before you say "Action" or speak so that it's easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a **Tail Slate**!!!

After you've recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world's leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let's move forward and see how to sync audio with video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

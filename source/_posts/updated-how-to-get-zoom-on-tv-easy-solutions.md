## 4\. Copy the clipped section multiple times

Then, double-click on the amount still available on the timeline to open the title editor section again. Make changes to the title you added here, only keeping the first letter.

Click on this clipped section on the timeline and copy it. Next, keep copying this clip multiple times continuously until the length of the collection on Track 1 to the 5-second mark.

![zoom in on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-4.jpg)

## 5\. Change the character of each clip

After making the previous edits, use your cursor to move to the first part of the timeline instead of zooming outward. Tap on the first clip that you had edited and double-click on it. In the text editing window, change the character to another random alphabet.

![change the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-5.jpg)

Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet. At this time, ensure that you do not make two consecutive letters have the same alphabet, as that will put off the effect. However, keep the last elongated clip the same character as you originally put it.

## 6\. Export the first letter clip

Then, please tap on the Export button at the top of the screen and add a name, like the first letter of your title. Click on the Settings button on this page to adjust the resolution and quality of the clip to the highest resolution for the best results.

For this, tap on the last clip on the timeline and double-click on it. Change the text in this clip to the second letter of your title. After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.

![tap on the text field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-6.jpg)

Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.

Now that you know how to edit the first and second letters in sequence, repeat this process for all of the letters of your title to create a full clip for all of the intro title letters. When you are done, please select these clips and press the Delete button to remove them from the timeline.

![select all of these clips and press delete](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-7.jpg)

![choose copy effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-12.jpg)

Right-click on it and tap on "Paste Effects". Repeat this one by one for all the clips after unhiding them for their particular step.

## 13\. Finishing touches to Opacity

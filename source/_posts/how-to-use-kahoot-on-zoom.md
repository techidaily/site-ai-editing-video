## Part 2\. Tips to Create Video Titles

Whether you've been video marketing for years or are just starting out, coming up with catchy video titles might be the most difficult aspect of the process. The title of a video has a significant role in whether or not viewers choose to click the play button, making it more than simply a minor feature. Poor titles make it difficult to attract views and expand your following, regardless of how fantastic your videos are. Here are the best scrutinized tips for creating best ranking titles for your videos:

**1\. Optimize the title using keywords for improved SEO**

It might be difficult to come up with a title that is original, concise, and descriptive. However, a strong video title stays something original. Keywords are crucial for more than simply your website. They are important for video titles, too. If you want people to see your videos when they search for certain phrases, those keywords should be in the title because Google and YouTube can't watch videos and grasp the content (yet).

**2\. Perfectly Match the Content**

A excellent video title explains to viewers what to anticipate from the video. It's unambiguous, straightforward, and sincere. Additionally, if you are familiar with your target demographic, you will be able to generate a lot more hits to your videos. Using a vague or confusing title is problematic as people are busy and need a reason to watch your movie. Similar to false content, misleading headlines deceive viewers and damage your reputation.

**3\. Attempt to pique interest**

Keep in mind that compelling video titles are an art form that appeals to viewers' emotions rather than being a precise SEO science. Try answering the questions on your own to get a catchy video title. People are more inclined to watch a video if you make reference to a secret or exceptional knowledge that you will disclose in it. Keep in mind that your goal is not to deceive viewers into viewing your video.

**4\. Increase the Click Through Rate**

The finest titles are those that best expose the vulnerabilities of the reader. Consider it a little preview for your video. If you are creating a how-to or instructive video that answers a question or gives information, you may want to consider include the question in the title. It also makes it simple to think up video concept.

**5\. Attempt to utilize cue (triggering) words**

Your title and description should both include your target keyword. You'll probably start to generate some ideas for a real video title after you begin your keyword research. To determine how persuasive these concepts are, use a trigger analyzer. You'll need to do study in order to accomplish this. As for the knowledge gap, consider how your target audience would respond.

### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.

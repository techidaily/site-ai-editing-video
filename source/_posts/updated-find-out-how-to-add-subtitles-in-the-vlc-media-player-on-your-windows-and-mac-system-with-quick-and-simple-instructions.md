## Best Audio Waveform Generator

For more than a century, sound waves and broadcasts have played an important role in shaping media as we know it. Here's how to implement them into your social media strategy. They have become popular in short video animations used to promote audio on social media, commonly referred to as audiograms.

Before learning everything there is to know about audiograms and how to make them, let's gain a better understanding of the significance of these patterns.

## Part 1\. What is an audio waveform?

A sound wave is the vibration of air molecules, which is how sound travels. The waveform describes the wave using a graph of how the air molecule is displaced over time.

Amplitude is the strength of a wave's action; the higher the amplitude, the more the air molecules are displaced. This also translates into loudness for the human ear; increasing the amplitude of the wave will increase how loud it appears to us. Sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waveforms are the most typical periodic waveforms.

## Part 2\. What is audio wave animation?

A waveform animation video is a short video clip that can be uploaded to social media that combines an audio file with a static background image and a straightforward waveform animation. Audio animations, an example of audio visualization, make for fantastic video content, which is increasingly valuable on ever-noisy social media platforms.

## Part 3\. Why do we use audio visualization?

We all know that there is a special way of feeling called synesthesia, which is both a psychological and a linguistic phenomenon. Similar to how you automatically link this rain scene with the sound of heavy rain when you see it. People's newly awakened senses are more about the synthesis of sensory experience with actual life experience than they are entirely about actual information. Therefore, for clean audio, enhancing it with complementary visual animation effects will improve the user's visual experience and, to some extent, offer additional information and impact to your audio.

![use audio visualization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/audio-waveform-animation-1.jpg)

## Part 4\. Best Audio Waveform Generator

Audio visualization can be presented in a variety of ways. The simplest kind of processing involves taking low-dimensional information like frequency, loudness, and rhythm and converting them into images in the form of colors, forms, strokes, etc. However, modern artificial intelligence technology can now extract high-dimensional visual attributes including style, tone, and emotion. But, for most non-technical players, such processes are obviously out of their league, therefore your best choice is to use a basic audio waveform generator. Following, we'll suggest 10 desktop or online generators so you may quickly finish the audio visualization project and create your audio-related videos.

Selective color is an effect that lets you desaturate all the colors in a photo or video while preserving one or more colors of your choice. It is done by isolating a specific color of your choice in the frame while all other colors turn into black and white, just like this.

By using this effect, we can draw viewers' attention to a specific point in the clip. If you want your video do the same, Filmora can be a good helper. Alright, we’ll be creating selective color effects in two examples. Let’s get started.

## Tutorial 1 on making color isolation by selective color effect

In this first example, we are going to use stock footage showing a subject on a bike.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Launch Wondershare Filmora and drag and drop your clip to the timeline.

![drag and drop the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-2.jpg)

Step2 Go to effects and then click “NewBlue FX” option and select Newblue filters.

![select newblue filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-3.jpg)

Step3 Find the Selective Color Effect and drag it onto the clip. The effect will be instantly applied.

![selective color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-4.jpg)

Step4 Next, double-click on the clip and check out the effects menu at the top of the screen.

![effects menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-5.jpg)

Step5 Open the preset drop-down menu. There will be a lot of presets with different colors. Select the preset you want to use. In this scenario, let us select Just Blue.

![select the preset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-6.jpg)

Step6 If you see a blue tint at a place or object which you want to be white and black, click on the first color.

![first color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-7.jpg)

Step7 Now adjust the range slider to decrease the number of unwanted tints.

![adjusting the range slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-8.jpg)

Step8 To blur the edges of the effects, turn up the softened slider and remove any unwanted tint previously remaining.

![blurring the edges of effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-9.jpg)

In this way, you can add a selective color effect to your video clips and isolate the color of your choice.

## Tutorial 2 on make color isolation using eyedropper tool

You might ask how do we use the eyedropper tool here. It can sample colors from anywhere in a video or an image and add them to your swatch panel. The steps to use the eyedropper tool to add a selective color to your video are below.

Step1 As same as the first one, launching Wondershare Filmora is the first priority. And drag your clip to the timeline.

![drag clip to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-10.jpg)

Step2 Go to effects at the top, and find Newblue effects, and click on the Newblue filters.

![newblue effects and filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-11.jpg)

Step3 Find the selective color effect and drag it to the clip.

![selective color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-12.jpg)

Step5 Click on the ‘first color’ and select the eye dropper tool. This will allow us to select the red flower in the preview window. You can also click different parts of the image to get the color that we want.

![select the first color and eye dropper tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-14.jpg)

Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.

![clicking on the second color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-15.jpg)

Step7 Pick the eyedropper tool and click it on the green part of the clip. Then adjust the range slider as needed.

![adjusting range slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-16.jpg)

Alright, let’s watch back the video to see how both colors are now isolated.

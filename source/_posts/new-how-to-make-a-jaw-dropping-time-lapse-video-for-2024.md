## Part 1: What is Time Lapse?

### 1\. Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography

Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).

Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.

The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 = RT

### 2\. What is a Time-lapse video used for?

The use of time-lapse photography and video is an excellent storytelling technique since compelling stories are essential to effective marketing. A time-lapse can also offer excellent insight into the advancement of developmental projects.

#### **①** Scientific research

* Scientists can visualize processes that would be challenging or sometimes even impossible to study in real life, thanks to time-lapse photography

#### **②** Individual enjoyment

Time-lapses are also utilized by filmmakers for scenes requiring extended durations of time with little significant activity occurring during the shot (such as night slowly turning into day).

#### **③** **Commercial use**

* Time-lapse videos are a wonderful instrument for enhancing the perception of your brand because they are. As a result, many consumers find it interesting.
* Time-lapse videos are the epitome of the old saying that "good things come in small packages" for any brand.

### 3\. How to Make a Time-lapse video?

## Part 2: Record or Shoot Your Time-Lapse Video

### 1\. Select Your Subject

The best way to create a time-lapse video is to pick your subject very carefully. Movement is the most crucial factor to consider while selecting a time-lapse subject. Any movement—whether it be caused by people, animals, vehicles, water, clouds, or anything else—can create an exciting and captivating time-lapse.

## Best Green Screen Software for Beginner on Mac

Almost every major film released in 2019 used green screen effects for at least one scene. While that is an entirely unscientific assessment that you should not cite in a college paper, given the accessibility and sophistication of today's green screen technology, it is probably not far off. Everyone has access to expert compositing technology, from Marvel movies to local news stations.

**WHAT ARE GREEN SCREEN AND CHROMA KEYING?**

The colored background you want to make transparent and remove from your shot is referred to as a green screen. This is typically a single-colored backdrop, which can be any color but is usually bright green because it is the color most dissimilar to human skin tones. (Blue screens were commonly used in the early days of film, and they may still be used in some cases.)

The chroma key is a time-honored and widely used visual effects technique. Simply stated, chroma key is the process of photographing a subject against a solid-color background and then removing that background in post-production and replacing it with transparency. The subject can then be positioned in front of any new background.

[Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has two modes based on your experience with video editing software. Users can use the easy mode or the full feature editor to access the program's full focus.

The theme focus can also make it easier to select the videos and audio that you want to use. There are a number of features and effects that can be used to complement various themes, which can help improve transitions or find different effects in the program without having to dig around.

The preview mode and music tracks available from the themes make it simple to enhance your video.

The full feature mode gives you even more control; this is where Filmora begins to resemble an actual video editor. You can drag images, sounds, and other media into different tracks and apply advanced effects.

Green screens, premade filters for color correction, cropping, cutting, splitting, and combining with simple tools are all available in the full feature mode. The full-featured editor also has an audio mixer and equalizer, as well as the ability to burn your creations to DVD, Facebook, Vimeo, and other platforms.

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In Openshot**

1. To create a chroma key (e.g. greenscreen or bluescreen) in OpenShot, begin by importing the files you're going to use.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-5.jpg)

1. Drag the file to be keyed onto Track 2 in the timeline, and the file to use as the background onto Track 1\. The plan is to make the green part of the upper image transparent so the file underneath becomes visible.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-6.jpg)

1. Click the **Effects** tab, find the **Chroma Key** effect, and drag it onto the top file in the timeline. You will see a star appear on the file in the timeline.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-7.jpg)

1. Right-click the top file in the timeline and select **Properties**. In the Properties window, click the **Effects** tab and then click the **Chroma Key** effect.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-8.jpg)

1. Click the green-colored area next to the word "Key" (shown above) to bring up the **Pick a Color** window (shown below). Click the eyedropper tool and then click on a green part of the video image.

### **iMovie**

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-11.jpg)

When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It's easy to overlay any footage with iMovie's green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.

The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It's incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.

**Supported OS:** macOS and iOS

**Features:**

* Options to modify and enhance video color settings
* Crop and rotate video clips
* Stabilize shaky videos
* Add video transitions
* Change the speed of clips.
* iMovie allows you to remove both green and blue screens

**Pros:**

* Clean, elegant interface
* Well optimized, responsive, and fast on modern Macs
* Effects and titles are all top-notch—especially for a free program
* Robust and useful interactions with other Apple products and software

**Cons:**

* Doesn’t have some advanced features present in other applications, like 360 video or Multicam
* Sometimes the efforts to keep the interface simple make finding a solution obtuse
* The user interface is not customizable
* Supports fewer export formats than some competing products

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In iMovie**

1. Open an **empty project**.

**DA VINCI RESOLVE**

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-18.jpg)

Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299\. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.

Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.

Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn't take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

**Features:**

* Options to modify and enhance video color settings
* Crop and rotate video clips
* Stabilize shaky videos
* Add video transitions
* Change the speed of clips.
* iMovie allows you to remove both green and blue screens

**Pros:**

* Clean, elegant interface
* Well optimized, responsive, and fast on modern Macs
* Effects and titles are all top-notch—especially for a free program
* Robust and useful interactions with other Apple products and software

* The user interface is not customizable
* Supports fewer export formats than some competing products

**Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab**

**Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool & select the color**

After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “**Color**” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “**3D**” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.

Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.

After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-19.jpg)

#### **Step 2 – Removing the color**

As you can see in the small rectangle, Resolve did the keying, but it doesn’t know what to do with it because we didn’t specify. Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.

Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-20.jpg)

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-21.jpg)

#### **Step 3 – Clean the edges**

As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.

To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-22.jpg)

#### **Step 3 – Done**

This is all for this method! Go ahead and add a background in the “Edit” mode and your job is done! Feel free to watch the video below, where I went through the same steps as above, but faster.

**Cons:**

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks**

## **1\.** **Record your video**

First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg)

You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40\. These screens are also handy for photography.

Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It's also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).

## **2\.** **Import and trim**

Once you've shot your video, download and install [Lightworks](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks). It's free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.

Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we're using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.

Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there's unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.

Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks > Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2\. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it's the same length as the video.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-38.jpg)

## **3\.** **Set the key**

Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you'll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.

Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You'll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you've made with the other sliders; it's a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.

To see how the filter is working, click the 'Reveal' box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.

The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-39.jpg)

## **4\.** **Tweak and export**

Once you're happy, you can use Lightworks' other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you're done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.

The only two export options you'll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won't do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.

Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click 'Start'. The processing will begin, and you'll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you'll be notified when it's complete.

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?**

If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.

If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you'll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.

**FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN**

1. **What is the most important thing when using a green screen?**

When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.

1. **Why do filmmakers use green screens?**

A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and/or foreground. It's used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject/actor/presenter.

1. **Why is a green screen not a different color?**

The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn't used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.

**Conclusion:**

Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.

Whether you're making a professional film or a simple family video, I'm confident you'll find something suitable among the options listed above.

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In Openshot**

1. To create a chroma key (e.g. greenscreen or bluescreen) in OpenShot, begin by importing the files you're going to use.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-5.jpg)

1. Drag the file to be keyed onto Track 2 in the timeline, and the file to use as the background onto Track 1\. The plan is to make the green part of the upper image transparent so the file underneath becomes visible.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-6.jpg)

1. Click the **Effects** tab, find the **Chroma Key** effect, and drag it onto the top file in the timeline. You will see a star appear on the file in the timeline.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-7.jpg)

1. Right-click the top file in the timeline and select **Properties**. In the Properties window, click the **Effects** tab and then click the **Chroma Key** effect.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-8.jpg)

1. Click the green-colored area next to the word "Key" (shown above) to bring up the **Pick a Color** window (shown below). Click the eyedropper tool and then click on a green part of the video image.

### **iMovie**

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-11.jpg)

When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It's easy to overlay any footage with iMovie's green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.

The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It's incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.

**Supported OS:** macOS and iOS

**Features:**

* Options to modify and enhance video color settings
* Crop and rotate video clips
* Stabilize shaky videos
* Add video transitions
* Change the speed of clips.
* iMovie allows you to remove both green and blue screens

**Pros:**

* Clean, elegant interface
* Well optimized, responsive, and fast on modern Macs
* Effects and titles are all top-notch—especially for a free program
* Robust and useful interactions with other Apple products and software

**Cons:**

* Doesn’t have some advanced features present in other applications, like 360 video or Multicam
* Sometimes the efforts to keep the interface simple make finding a solution obtuse
* The user interface is not customizable
* Supports fewer export formats than some competing products

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In iMovie**

1. Open an **empty project**.
2. Select the **background** you would like to use.

**DA VINCI RESOLVE**

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-18.jpg)

Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299\. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.

Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.

Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn't take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

**Features:**

* Options to modify and enhance video color settings
* Crop and rotate video clips
* Stabilize shaky videos
* Add video transitions
* Change the speed of clips.
* iMovie allows you to remove both green and blue screens

**Pros:**

* Clean, elegant interface
* Well optimized, responsive, and fast on modern Macs
* Effects and titles are all top-notch—especially for a free program

* Sometimes the efforts to keep the interface simple make finding a solution obtuse
* The user interface is not customizable
* Supports fewer export formats than some competing products

**Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab**

**Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool & select the color**

After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “**Color**” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “**3D**” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.

Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.

After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-19.jpg)

#### **Step 2 – Removing the color**

As you can see in the small rectangle, Resolve did the keying, but it doesn’t know what to do with it because we didn’t specify. Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.

Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-20.jpg)

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-21.jpg)

#### **Step 3 – Clean the edges**

As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.

To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-22.jpg)

#### **Step 3 – Done**

This is all for this method! Go ahead and add a background in the “Edit” mode and your job is done! Feel free to watch the video below, where I went through the same steps as above, but faster.

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks**

## **1\.** **Record your video**

First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg)

You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40\. These screens are also handy for photography.

Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It's also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).

## **2\.** **Import and trim**

Once you've shot your video, download and install [Lightworks](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks). It's free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.

Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we're using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.

Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there's unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.

Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks > Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2\. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it's the same length as the video.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-38.jpg)

## **3\.** **Set the key**

Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you'll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.

Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You'll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you've made with the other sliders; it's a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.

To see how the filter is working, click the 'Reveal' box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.

The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-39.jpg)

## **4\.** **Tweak and export**

Once you're happy, you can use Lightworks' other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you're done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.

The only two export options you'll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won't do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.

Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click 'Start'. The processing will begin, and you'll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you'll be notified when it's complete.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-40.jpg)

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?**

If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.

If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you'll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.

**FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN**

1. **What is the most important thing when using a green screen?**

When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.

1. **Why do filmmakers use green screens?**

A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and/or foreground. It's used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject/actor/presenter.

1. **Why is a green screen not a different color?**

The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn't used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.

**Conclusion:**

Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.

Whether you're making a professional film or a simple family video, I'm confident you'll find something suitable among the options listed above.

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In Openshot**

1. To create a chroma key (e.g. greenscreen or bluescreen) in OpenShot, begin by importing the files you're going to use.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-5.jpg)

1. Drag the file to be keyed onto Track 2 in the timeline, and the file to use as the background onto Track 1\. The plan is to make the green part of the upper image transparent so the file underneath becomes visible.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-6.jpg)

1. Click the **Effects** tab, find the **Chroma Key** effect, and drag it onto the top file in the timeline. You will see a star appear on the file in the timeline.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-7.jpg)

1. Right-click the top file in the timeline and select **Properties**. In the Properties window, click the **Effects** tab and then click the **Chroma Key** effect.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-8.jpg)

### **iMovie**

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-11.jpg)

When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It's easy to overlay any footage with iMovie's green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.

The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It's incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.

**Supported OS:** macOS and iOS

**Features:**

* Options to modify and enhance video color settings
* Crop and rotate video clips
* Stabilize shaky videos
* Add video transitions
* Change the speed of clips.
* iMovie allows you to remove both green and blue screens

**Pros:**

* Clean, elegant interface
* Well optimized, responsive, and fast on modern Macs
* Effects and titles are all top-notch—especially for a free program
* Robust and useful interactions with other Apple products and software

**Cons:**

* Doesn’t have some advanced features present in other applications, like 360 video or Multicam
* Sometimes the efforts to keep the interface simple make finding a solution obtuse
* The user interface is not customizable
* Supports fewer export formats than some competing products

**DA VINCI RESOLVE**

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-18.jpg)

Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299\. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.

Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.

Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn't take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

**Features:**

* Options to modify and enhance video color settings
* Crop and rotate video clips
* Stabilize shaky videos
* Add video transitions
* Change the speed of clips.
* iMovie allows you to remove both green and blue screens

**Pros:**

* Clean, elegant interface
* Well optimized, responsive, and fast on modern Macs

* The user interface is not customizable
* Supports fewer export formats than some competing products

**Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab**

**Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool & select the color**

After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “**Color**” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “**3D**” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.

Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.

After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-19.jpg)

#### **Step 2 – Removing the color**

As you can see in the small rectangle, Resolve did the keying, but it doesn’t know what to do with it because we didn’t specify. Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.

Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-20.jpg)

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-21.jpg)

#### **Step 3 – Clean the edges**

As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.

To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-22.jpg)

#### **Step 3 – Done**

This is all for this method! Go ahead and add a background in the “Edit” mode and your job is done! Feel free to watch the video below, where I went through the same steps as above, but faster.

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks**

## **1\.** **Record your video**

First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg)

You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40\. These screens are also handy for photography.

Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It's also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).

## **2\.** **Import and trim**

Once you've shot your video, download and install [Lightworks](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks). It's free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.

Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we're using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.

Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there's unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.

Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks > Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2\. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it's the same length as the video.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-38.jpg)

## **3\.** **Set the key**

Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you'll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.

Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You'll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you've made with the other sliders; it's a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.

To see how the filter is working, click the 'Reveal' box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.

The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-39.jpg)

## **4\.** **Tweak and export**

Once you're happy, you can use Lightworks' other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you're done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.

The only two export options you'll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won't do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.

Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click 'Start'. The processing will begin, and you'll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you'll be notified when it's complete.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-40.jpg)

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?**

If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.

If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you'll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.

**FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN**

1. **What is the most important thing when using a green screen?**

When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.

1. **Why do filmmakers use green screens?**

A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and/or foreground. It's used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject/actor/presenter.

1. **Why is a green screen not a different color?**

The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn't used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.

**Conclusion:**

Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.

Whether you're making a professional film or a simple family video, I'm confident you'll find something suitable among the options listed above.

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In Openshot**

1. To create a chroma key (e.g. greenscreen or bluescreen) in OpenShot, begin by importing the files you're going to use.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-5.jpg)

1. Drag the file to be keyed onto Track 2 in the timeline, and the file to use as the background onto Track 1\. The plan is to make the green part of the upper image transparent so the file underneath becomes visible.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-6.jpg)

1. Click the **Effects** tab, find the **Chroma Key** effect, and drag it onto the top file in the timeline. You will see a star appear on the file in the timeline.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-7.jpg)

1. Right-click the top file in the timeline and select **Properties**. In the Properties window, click the **Effects** tab and then click the **Chroma Key** effect.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-8.jpg)

1. Click the green-colored area next to the word "Key" (shown above) to bring up the **Pick a Color** window (shown below). Click the eyedropper tool and then click on a green part of the video image.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-9.jpg)

### **iMovie**

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-11.jpg)

When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It's easy to overlay any footage with iMovie's green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.

The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It's incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.

**Supported OS:** macOS and iOS

**Features:**

* Options to modify and enhance video color settings
* Crop and rotate video clips
* Stabilize shaky videos
* Add video transitions
* Change the speed of clips.
* iMovie allows you to remove both green and blue screens

**Pros:**

* Clean, elegant interface
* Well optimized, responsive, and fast on modern Macs
* Effects and titles are all top-notch—especially for a free program
* Robust and useful interactions with other Apple products and software

**Cons:**

* Doesn’t have some advanced features present in other applications, like 360 video or Multicam
* Sometimes the efforts to keep the interface simple make finding a solution obtuse
* The user interface is not customizable
* Supports fewer export formats than some competing products

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In iMovie**

1. Open an **empty project**.
2. Select the **background** you would like to use.

**DA VINCI RESOLVE**

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-18.jpg)

Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299\. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.

Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.

Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn't take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

**Features:**

* Options to modify and enhance video color settings
* Crop and rotate video clips
* Stabilize shaky videos
* Add video transitions
* Change the speed of clips.
* iMovie allows you to remove both green and blue screens

**Pros:**

* Clean, elegant interface
* Well optimized, responsive, and fast on modern Macs
* Effects and titles are all top-notch—especially for a free program
* Robust and useful interactions with other Apple products and software

**Cons:**

* Doesn’t have some advanced features present in other applications, like 360 video or Multicam
* Sometimes the efforts to keep the interface simple make finding a solution obtuse
* The user interface is not customizable
* Supports fewer export formats than some competing products

**Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab**

**Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool & select the color**

After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “**Color**” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “**3D**” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.

Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.

After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-19.jpg)

#### **Step 2 – Removing the color**

As you can see in the small rectangle, Resolve did the keying, but it doesn’t know what to do with it because we didn’t specify. Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.

Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-20.jpg)

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-21.jpg)

#### **Step 3 – Clean the edges**

As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.

To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-22.jpg)

#### **Step 3 – Done**

This is all for this method! Go ahead and add a background in the “Edit” mode and your job is done! Feel free to watch the video below, where I went through the same steps as above, but faster.

**Cons:**

* 3D Video Editing is not supported
* No Split and Merge features

**Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks**

## **1\.** **Record your video**

First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg)

You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40\. These screens are also handy for photography.

Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It's also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).

## **2\.** **Import and trim**

Once you've shot your video, download and install [Lightworks](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks). It's free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.

Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we're using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.

Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there's unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.

Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks > Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2\. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it's the same length as the video.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-38.jpg)

## **3\.** **Set the key**

Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you'll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.

Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You'll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you've made with the other sliders; it's a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.

To see how the filter is working, click the 'Reveal' box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.

The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-39.jpg)

## **4\.** **Tweak and export**

Once you're happy, you can use Lightworks' other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you're done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.

The only two export options you'll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won't do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.

Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click 'Start'. The processing will begin, and you'll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you'll be notified when it's complete.

![green-screen-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-40.jpg)

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?**

If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.

If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you'll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.

**FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN**

1. **What is the most important thing when using a green screen?**

When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.

1. **Why do filmmakers use green screens?**

A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and/or foreground. It's used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject/actor/presenter.

1. **Why is a green screen not a different color?**

The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn't used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.

**Conclusion:**

Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.

Whether you're making a professional film or a simple family video, I'm confident you'll find something suitable among the options listed above.

## How to Cut Videos on Mac without Using FFmpeg?

Tiktok, Instagram reels, and Ads are well-known short video platforms that are popular due to their ease of use. Making film collections for entertainment purposes is a popular trend. As the previous user mentioned, sometimes all you want is a section of your movie, which can be the highlight or any other part you want to keep. Long videos are no longer a problem with such a video cutter for Mac. If that's what you're looking for, you might want to look into some of the software that's available here.

**HOW TO CUT VIDEO ON MAC WITHOUT USING FFMPEG?**

What are FFmpeg and its cons for cut videos?

Without transcoding the media, FFmpeg can cut, trim, and extract videos. This is an excellent method for preserving original quality and avoiding generation loss.

Because of how keyframes work, it is impossible to cut at an exact point in time using FFmpeg without transcoding the video. As a result, you're left with a cut at the nearest keyframe.

This software program additionally enables batch processing, which converts a couple of video files at the same time. Additionally, a plethora of presets are available to guide you to the preferred output without having to tinker with a plethora of options.

Handbrake is a powerful and excellent video converter for Windows, Mac, and Linux that should not be overlooked. It provides all of the necessary features in a simple tool that gives the user complete control over the output. Before we get into the specifics, here's a rundown of Handbrake's advantages and disadvantages.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

* Full Editing Control
* Simple Interface
* Open Source

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

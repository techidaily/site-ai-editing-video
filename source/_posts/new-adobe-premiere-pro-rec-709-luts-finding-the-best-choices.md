## How to Zoom Picture in Picture [Easy Solution]

Zoom is one of the greatest options on the market for video conferencing. It doesn't matter whether you use it at home or in an office environment; it will quickly link the team members. One of the most popular video conferencing programs is Zoom. When in-person meetings aren't feasible, it enables you to communicate electronically with employees, and it's been a major popularity for social occasions as well. In case you're not acquainted, picture-in-picture mode enables you to watch videos from one app while using your PC normally. The movie will keep playing in a tiny thumbnail window so that two applications may work simultaneously on your smartphone.

You may create virtual audio and video conferences, webinars, live chats, screen sharing, and other collaboration tools with Zoom, a cloud-based video communications solution. Zoom's most recent iPhone apps let you dismiss a Zoom Meeting while keeping the Zoom video call open in a picture-in-picture mode. To join a Zoom conference, you don't need an account, and because the software works with Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android devices, nearly anybody can use it. Since using Zoom's picture-in-picture mode is the same as using it with other applications, you shouldn't have any trouble if you often use PiP mode. Here are the top 4 methods you can refer to picture in picture in Zoom.

## Method 1: Swap Shared Screen with Video

You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Before leaving the meeting if you're not giving a presentation or speaking, you should definitely mute Zoom on your iPhone to prevent noises from your typing or other activities from entering the conversation. Additionally, keep in mind to switch off the camera if you're engaged in something distracting, at least for the duration of your activity. To reopen the Zoom Meeting and go back to the Zoom app, touch the Picture-in-Picture mode pane. Here are some actions to keep in mind:

### Steps to Swap Shared Screen for Zoom Picture in Picture

Step1Launch or enter a Zoom meeting. Keep the video on your main screen at all times, closing the chat and participant list as necessary.

Step2Tap the Home button or swipe up from the bottom of the screen.

![how to zoom picture in picture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/swap-shared-screen-zoom.jpg)

Step3Picture-in-picture mode should be activated automatically throughout the meeting.

You may make quick changes between inputs with no latency or disruption to your video output by using the ergonomic buttons.

Step3As a third option, Zoom offers ATEM Mini, which enables you to switch between several inputs, add custom visuals, and adjust audio levels all from a single interface. To improve the quality of your production, you may even use smooth transitions like wipes or fades. You can even test any input stream before making it live.

## Conclusion

When you are doing a Zoom Meeting and share your screen, only to discover that what the other attendees see is a split screen with your material and the other Attendee cams, it is highly annoying. You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Someone must be sharing information in the Zoom conference for the Picture in Picture, or "Split Screen" option, to be active. We've listed the top techniques for doing it effectively above. To do this work without difficulty, use them as your guide.

When you are doing a Zoom Meeting and share your screen, only to discover that what the other attendees see is a split screen with your material and the other Attendee cams, it is highly annoying. You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Someone must be sharing information in the Zoom conference for the Picture in Picture, or "Split Screen" option, to be active. We've listed the top techniques for doing it effectively above. To do this work without difficulty, use them as your guide.

## Part 1\. Steps to Save Windows Movie Maker Video as MP4

There are two scenarios you may come across while dealing with Windows Movie Maker MP4 situation. First, you might be editing your video on Windows Movie Maker, and you want to save it in MP4 format. Second, you might have received a video file saved in the native Windows Movie Maker file format and you want to convert it to MP4 file format. In the second scenario, you must opt for a Windows Movie Maker to MP4 converter such as VideoConverterFactory.

For the first scenario where you are editing your video on Windows Movie Maker, the solution is simple. This is because the default file format to save a video file on Windows Movie Maker is MP4\. There are other options available such as WMV, but if you opt for the recommended settings, you can easily save your video file in MP4\. Here are the steps for Windows Movie Maker to mp4 file format.

Step1Launch Windows Movie Maker on your PC. Create a new project and import your video clips. Split, trim, join, add transitions, effects, and titles as per your requirements.

Step2When you are done editing your video, go to Home tab> Save Movie button available on Share section.

## 10 Best Sony LUT for Different Purposes

If you've ever worked in the color grading profession, you're aware of how time-consuming and labor-intensive it is to achieve a specific look on a scene. To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.

Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image's colors.

## Benefits of using LUTs

There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We've already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.

### 1\. A beginning towards professionalism

This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.

You'll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You'll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.

However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.

### 2\. It saves your time

Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn't the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.

However, there's a good probability that it won't look the same in all of the images. This is where you'll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It's nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.

### 3\. Work on a budget

Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I'm sure we've all done at some point.

Whether it's a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.

### 4\. It provides an artistic approach

LUTs are beneficial because they allow videos shot with cameras that shoot very dark, discolored images to have more vivid tones and contrast. This is excellent for grabbing viewers' attention and making videos more intriguing and engaging. LUTs add an artistic element to videos and can help you develop a visual artistic identity for your videos if you use the same colors. Another advantage of LUTs is that they enhance the color quality of videos shot on smartphones with particular color schemes. Although this varies significantly from brand to brand, you can use LUTs to make a Smartphone video more vibrant and appealing.

Even though the process is easy, we want you to stay ahead. Hence, here is a step-by-step procedure for creating fast motion in Filmora:

##### Step 1Create a New Project and Import Media

First, connect your iOS device to your Wondershare Filmora device. After that, launch Filmora to access the main menu. From there, click on the "New Project" tab fashioned in the center. Expand the "Import" option in the Project Media section and select the suitable option. In this case, choose the "Import from Phone or Camera" option.

##### Step 2Access the Uniform Speed Section

After bringing the imported media to the timeline, select it to access the settings panel. Select the "Speed > Uniform Speed" tab from the appeared panel. Then, drag the Speed slider on the right side to increase speed. Afterward, click the "Play" button on the preview screen to see the results.

##### Step 3Apply Frame Bending and Export

This part is optional, but if you find an irregularity or roughness to the video, apply this. Go to the "AI Frame Interpolation" section at the bottom and expand the options. From the dropdown menu, select the "Frame Bending" option and do the rendering from the timeline. After everything is set, select the "Export" button at the top right corner.

### Trending Video Editing Features of Wondershare Filmora

Filmora is a versatile tool that is not confined to speed manipulation or fast motion only. This editor offers audio, text, AI editing options, and video. Here are some prominent key features of Wondershare Filmora to help you in editing:

#### 1\. [Speed Ramping](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The other option for speed modification mentioned previously is speed ramping. This option comes with 6 editable speed change presets for automated editing. However, you can also employ the custom preset to create your own way. Moreover, it allows the audio pitch option to enable automated maintenance of audio.

#### 2\. [AI Smart Cutout](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

There is more than one way of removing and replacing a background in Filmora. Smart Cutout offers an AI-integrated masking option to cut out the selected parts. You can also set preferences for Edge Thickness or Edge Feather for accuracy. Afterward, you can introduce three background options: color, grid, or more.

#### 3\. [AI Text-to-Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Bring your imagination to visuals with this amazing generative AI video creator. It creates videos from text and covers the voice and graphical elements. Users can customize the AI voice and ratio before generating a video. The prompt section offers up to 1000 characters for adding a script or giving directions.

#### 4\. [AI Smart Masking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Are there any effects or filters you want to introduce to only a specific part of the video? Use Filmora's AI mask for automated masking of an object or background. The mask brush selects the relevant area on its own. Besides AI masks, there is a manual masking option or mask shapes to apply. You can also customize the Brush size according to the video.

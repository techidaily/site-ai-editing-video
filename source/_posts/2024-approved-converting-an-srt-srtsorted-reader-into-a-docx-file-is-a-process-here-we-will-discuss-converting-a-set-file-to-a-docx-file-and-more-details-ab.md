**SRT to Word: How to Convert an SRT File to Docx file?**

The SubRip Text (SRT) format is a popular subtitle format used in many videos. While SRT files are simple text files that can be edited with any text editor, they are not as convenient to work with as MS Word documents.

For one thing, it cannot be easy to format text in a way that is easy to read. In addition, SRT files do not support features such as spell checking and grammar checking.

As a result, converting SRT to Word can be a useful way to improve the quality of subtitles. In addition, it can also make it easier to translate subtitles into other languages.

Other than that, you might need to convert an SRT to a Word document when you need to edit the subtitles for a video you're working on or you want to create a transcript of a recorded conversation.

You might think that converting a speech to text is difficult or impossible. But it's not!

Here's how you can easily convert SRT to DOCX files. Let's begin.

## What is an SRT file?

SRT files are used for subtitles. Subtitles are the audio track of a video or movie. Subtitles are displayed alongside a video or movie on your TV or computer screen. They allow the viewer to understand what is being said in the language they speak.

People have recently begun using online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu to watch movies and television shows. While streaming services offer thousands of movies and shows, there are still many that only exist in a form that can be viewed in their entirety. This requires the user to download the entire file (usually in a format known as a .srt file).

## Why do we need to convert SRT files into Word?

Subtitles are a great way to enjoy movies and TV shows in different languages. They provide text on the screen that tells you what the characters are saying, so you can follow along even if you don't speak the language. However, SRT files can be difficult to work with because they are incompatible with all software programs**.** So, they need to be converted into Word. Some other reasons include:

* It allows your content to be viewed within a web browser or mobile device without downloading .srt file.
* If you need to embed the video into another site, you can do so easily with the.docx file.
* Learning a new language by downloading SRT subtitles from video.

## Convert SRT to Word file Manually

You must first remove the time codes to convert an SRT file to a Word document. Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

Keep in mind that this manual method will not retain any formatting from the original SRT file, so you may need to do some additional editing to get the final results you want.

## Convert SRT to Word file Manually

You must first remove the time codes to convert an SRT file to a Word document. Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

Keep in mind that this manual method will not retain any formatting from the original SRT file, so you may need to do some additional editing to get the final results you want.

## Steps to Create Green Screen Videos in After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

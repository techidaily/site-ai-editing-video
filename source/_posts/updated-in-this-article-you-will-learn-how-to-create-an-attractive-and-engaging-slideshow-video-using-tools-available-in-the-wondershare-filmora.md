![adding a fade effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png)

Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!

##### Step6 Add The Music

* Click on the **Audio** icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.
* Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.
* Then add it to the timeline's audio track.

**Match The Video With The Audio Markers**

To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:

After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![unscaled photo in the main play window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

## Synchronizing Videos Can Be Hectic, but Do You Wish to Know a Good Tool for This Purpose? This Article Will Discuss Wondershare Filmora, Which Is Perfect for This

Video quality and engagement are prone to impact badly if your audio is not synchronized with the video. This can happen because of technical issues or frame rate mismatches.

## Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?

Audio and video synchronization is important for presenting a good quality viewing experience. Here are the main reasons you shouldn’t neglect this in your audio and video.

### Lip Sync and Narrative Flow

Synchronizing audio and video is crucial to maintaining the film's narrative flow. Well-synchronized audio and video offer a very smooth experience to the viewers. If the lips and dialogue flow are not well maintained, it can cause distraction in the storytelling. As a result, the real message won't be conveyed to the viewers.

### Viewer Engagement

Do you wish to ensure that your viewers pay full attention to your video and that your message is well conveyed? Your video quality and sound matter the most for the best experience. When the audio and video are well-synced, the viewers pay attention to the content. They are not distracted due to the bad quality of the video.

### Value of Quality Production

A high-quality video with perfect sound quality and proper syncing builds a good perception. If the video quality is bad or does not have proper sync, it can leave a bad impression. Therefore, to enhance the impact of these emotional and dramatic effects, it is imperative to focus on these core things.

### Professionalism and Quality

To make your viewer experience outstanding, focus on paying attention to details. A good quality video represents your professionalism and the standards of your production. When it is synchronized, the viewer will always see this as a high-quality creation.

Discord is no secret, gradually becoming one of the most popular platforms for everyone. And why not when it allows users to communicate via different channels, including video calls, texts, media, voice calls, and files through private channels.

The digital platform is under Discord Inc and became official a while back. It operates under multiple operating systems, including macOS, Android, Linux, iOS, Android, iPadOS, and web browsers. As a result, it is an excellent way for everyone. The platform has risen to fame in the last six months, with many people using it.

As much as the platform is doing great, many things often arise, especially creating **Discord GIF Avatar**. In other words, how to deliver the best PFP or avatar for your account. Since Discord has recently gained maximum fame, there are fewer details. Fortunately, this article is here to save the day. It includes relevant information about an **animated avatar for Discord** or GIF discord avatar. Read through the summary below.

#### In this article

01 [Why Discord Is Becoming Popular Recently?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Discord Emojis?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create Discord Emoji GIF?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Why is Discord Becoming Popular Recently?

How often do you visit social media? You probably know that the current trending networking platform is Discord if it is frequent. After all, it has risen to fame with millions of users in no time. Plus, the introduction of the **GIF Avatar Discord** has left many fans amazed with the application. You can also confirm its popularity with the many friends using it.

Discord features multiple good points that explain why most people love it, including the **avatar Discord GIF.** However, many people still question its popularity and its rise recently. As a result, this section will answer this question using relevant facts.

**●** **It is suitable for gaming communication:** Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option. When we consider TeamSpeak, you realize that it is limiting with the option available since you only have a voice call. Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.

**●** **Most services are free: Discord includes multiple benefits that make** communication straightforward and convenient. Luckily, most of the services available are free, meaning that almost everyone can access them. As a result, many people would quickly settle for Discord compared to other platforms since you can get so much at no cost. Currently, they have the **Discord Nitro gif avatar**, which is affordable and multiplies the fun.

**●** **Create Discord bots are no cost:** Discord allows users to create bots for free without including any hosting fee hence an affordable option.

**●** **Constant updates that match the audiences' needs: Things change in no time for Discord**. Why? The developers are active and listen to the community's opinion of what they want and why they need it. Therefore, it delivers the show that people urgently need leading to popularity rise.

**●** **It rarely includes ads in private chats:** A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.

**●** **Discord is safe:** The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.

## Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?

From the information above, you can tell that Discord's primary role is communication. And we all know that emojis are the real deal in every conversation since emojis easily communicate our feelings. Currently, most platforms with messaging options include emojis to multiply the fun. The same case happens for Discord emojis. They are there to make communication appealing, interesting, funny and reveal how you feel about a situation.

**Importance of Discord emojis**

**●** **Emojis help you to communicate the right emotions**. Sometimes, it's impossible to express the right feelings using words, and emojis come to the rescue in such situations. Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.

**●** **They are fun and exciting**. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.

**●** **Emojis make communication easy**. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.

**●** **It offers a sense of presence in a conversation**. People believed that they could only hold exciting discussions when they were together. Over time, this statement has been proved impossible since we can't always be there to hold serious talks. We need Discord emojis since they give a sense of physical presence.

**●** **They liven up a serious conversation**. Have you ever noticed, people tend to include emojis when having serious talks making them more casual and creating a friendly environment that suits everyone? And this trick often works.

Discord emojis are conversation aids that every communication channel need. Why not, when it gives a sense of friendliness. Try out the Discord emojis and discover the simplest ways to make a conversation lively.

## Part 3 How to Create Discord Emoji GIF

There are two popular ways to create an emoji **Discord GIF avatar, Discord Nitro animated avatar** and **Discord GIF avatar without Nitro.** The emoji GIF you make depends on the Nitro version you are using.

Creating a Discord account is simple and free, not even considering the hosting cost. However, the developers include the Discord Nitro version, which contains multiple features that make conversations bigger and better. However, the Nitro version is a paid subscription of $4.99 monthly. Creating a discord emoji GIF is quite simple if you are under the later version. After all, it includes the available GIF options that you can choose from depending on your taste. However, if you are under the free option, you won't have this option.

![how to make Discord emojis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/discord-emoji-gif-1.jpg)

For standard Discord users, things work differently. They can still add **Discord GIF Avatar** emojis but via a long process. Check out the details below referencing MiniTool content creator Zoe in an article about making Discord PFP a GIF.

**Step 1: Download Application of Choice**

We have many websites that offer **Discord GIF avatar free.** The **animated avatars for Discord** emojis are readily available for all. Some popular apps are Giphy, Tenor, and Emoji.gg. The latter is a simple platform with multiple animated Discord emojis; you can download those that match your taste.

**Step 2:** Search for the GIF you need

**Step 4:** Save on the GIF and export it to your PC.

Another convenient option for non-nitro users is adding animated emojis to a Discord Server using the NQN Discord bot. Note that you need to have a server to include the NQN bot.

## Part 1 How to Make a Discord PFP Avatar Online

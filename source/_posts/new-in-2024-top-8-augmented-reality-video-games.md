FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.

* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.
* Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience.

## Start Your Creative Journey Now. Follow This Step-by-Step Guide on How to Add Double Exposure Effects to Your Personal Videos by Using the Filmora Video Editor

Are you an aspiring video creator, or do you enjoy editing videos that captivate your viewers' attention? In this digital era, it is essential to edit your videos by using tools that can help you produce a masterpiece and will impress your audience. With Filmora Video Editor, it is easier to create polished and professional-looking videos that stand out from the rest.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

To start your creative journey, you can hone your skills by focusing on at least one technique and progressively learning new skills. One of the various video editing techniques you can employ is double exposure. This method is based on an old technique in photography in which a film is exposed twice to create a single image. This article shows you how to use the same method to combine two or more video clips and create a double exposure effect.

You can create artistic videos that tell various stories and captivate viewers by using Filmora. The following steps describe how to create a double exposure effect in Filmora.

Step1 Download the Filmora application

![filmora download page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Before you start editing, click <https://bit.ly/3tav2d5> to download the Filmora app. On the page that appears, click the **Free Download** option. Then, the Filmora installer is automatically downloaded. To start installing Filmora, double-click the installer and click **Agree** to agree with the terms and conditions. Then, wait for approximately 2 minutes for the installation to complete.

Step2 Start a new project in Filmora

![set up a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-2.jpg)

After a successful installation, the app automatically runs, and you can start editing videos. Click **New Project** to start a project on a clean canvas.

Before starting a new project, we recommend you plan a theme for your videos. You can incorporate different elements into your videos to convey a dramatic, light, or fun theme. This step will help you communicate the mood and message you want to convey to the audience.

Step3 Select a foreground video

![add a base video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-3.jpg)

To create a trendy double exposure effect, record a video clip with a white or neutral background. Then, import the specified video to Filmora. In the second layer of the video editing pane, drag the video.

The first video is called the foreground video, which serves as the base video to achieve the desired double exposure effect. It is important to choose neutral or calm colors to make it easier for you to remove the background and highlight the main subject of your video.

Step4 Edit the foreground video

![adjust the color settings of the foreground video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-4.jpg)

Edit the foreground video by adjusting the color settings. Click the **Color Correction** icon to open the color settings. In the **Advanced Color Tuning** box that appears, click **Adjust**. In this article, the value of **Exposure** is set to **18,** and **Contrast** is set to **28**. Then, **Vibrance** and **Saturation** are set to **\-100**. In the **Light** settings, the values of **Highlights** and **Shadows** are set to **\-100**, **Whites** is set to **0**, and **Blacks** is set to **\-30**. You can experiment and play with the settings based on the theme that you want to achieve.

Step5 Select a background video

![import a video clip as a background video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-5.jpg)

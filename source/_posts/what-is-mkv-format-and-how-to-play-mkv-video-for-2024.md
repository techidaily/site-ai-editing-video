### 01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content

One of the main applications of **AI on YouTube** is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the "Trashy Video Classifier" to scan and examine the feedback.

Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.

### 02Add New Video Effects

The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment. You can now swap out backgrounds from videos with just one click due to the in-built AI features on YouTube. This AI neural feature is prepared by **Google’s AI YouTube** researchers to make it easier for the AI algorithms to understand video patterns. This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.

### 03Maintain Age Restrictions

Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.

YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.

Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.

### 04"Up Next" Feature

The "Up Next" feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.

This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his/her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.

### 05Training on Depth Prediction

YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that **Google’s AI YouTube** researchers used the "mannequin challenge" to understand depth predictions.

In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).

### 06Tackle Fake News

Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.

YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.

## Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?

![youtube recommendation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-learning-ai-marketing-youtube-3.jpg)

YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.

YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.

YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his/her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.

YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.

YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016\. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the "borderline content".

Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:

### 01Select a Royalty Free Music Plan

Adding suitable background music can uplift the appeal of your slideshow presentation to greater extents. While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.

However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.

### 02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices

When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.

![Recommended Audio Choices](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-10.JPG)

### 03Synchronize the Slideshow Music and the Contents

The credibility of your background audio lies in adding additional spark and integrity to the stills and videos of the presentation. When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.

Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.

If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.

![Selecting the Appropriate Background Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-11.JPG)

## Part 2 Best 5 Tip to Make a Slideshow with Music

While the visual elements count to be the major attractions of a slideshow presentation, subtle background music can work to bind the audience with the rhythm and flow of the presentation. Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:

### 01Select a Royalty Free Music Plan

Adding suitable background music can uplift the appeal of your slideshow presentation to greater extents. While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.

However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.

### 02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices

When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.

You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.

![Recommended Audio Choices](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-10.JPG)

### 03Synchronize the Slideshow Music and the Contents

The credibility of your background audio lies in adding additional spark and integrity to the stills and videos of the presentation. When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.

Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.

If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.

![Selecting the Appropriate Background Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-11.JPG)

### 04Curate and Test

When you are done with creating the perfect soundtrack for your presentation with the choicest of music, proceed to narrow down your list to a finer selection via curating the elements of the soundtrack. All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.

Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.

![Slideshow Curating and Testing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-12.JPG)

**●** **Sound Proof the Final Selection**

When you are happy with your work, move ahead with running a mock slideshow to have an assurance of everything being at its respective place. Take note of the music flow to be in cohesion with the other elements of the presentation, check the audio quality, resolution, etc., properties and make changes where necessary.

## Have You Ever Wanted to Speed up or Slow Down a Video? Maybe It Was Too Long, or You Wanted to Draw Out an Exciting Part of the Video without Having to Watch the Boring Parts

Have you ever wanted to speed up or slow down a video? Maybe it was too long, or you wanted to draw out an exciting part of the video without having to watch the boring parts.

In this article, we will be showing you how to use FFmpeg to speed up and slow down your videos using CLI. You'll also find some other useful FFmpeg commands that you can use on your videos.

Finally, we will explain how to automate these commands so that you can run them on all your videos with ease.

![how to automate these commands](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. [What is FFmpeg?](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html)

FFmpeg is a free and open-source cross-platform software project that can record, convert, and stream audio and video. It was developed by Fabrice Bellard in 2000\. It has since become one of the most popular tools for transcoding media content on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows NT, and more.

One of its lesser-known capabilities is to speed up or slow down videos in just about any design you can think of — with either the audio or the video synced to the other if desired.

### [Uses of FFmpeg](https://ottverse.com/what-is-ffmpeg-installation-use-cases/)

FFMPEG is a command-line tool that can manipulate and transcode video files. Its uses are as follows:

* FFmpeg can create, trim, join or separate video clips on the fly and encode them into formats including MPEG, VOB, M2TS, TS, RMVB, or AVI.
* It can be used for Video processing, Video packaging support, Video compression, Audio, and Video container support, FFplay, and FFprobe.
* It also has extensive options for altering the look of an image in just about any way imaginable. Whether you want to change the brightness, hue, saturation, or perform multiple operations like subsampling (resizing) without reducing quality—the list goes on!

You could think of it as the Swiss army knife for video manipulation tasks. The interface might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, all commands are broken down into simple English phrases.

The most important thing to know before getting started with this is how to use FFmpeg's -i and -v flags for input and output, respectively. To apply effects like slow motion playback or fast motion playback, use these flags in tandem with one another when specifying which file should be edited.

### Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg

FFmpeg has many benefits over other video editing software because it is free and open source, meaning that you have access to the code so that you can modify it if needed. Thus, it's a better option when compared to other video editing software such as Avidemux, QuickTime Pro 7, and Adobe Premiere Elements 12\. Some of these benefits include:

* Being able to edit videos on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X);
* FFmpeg has features to speed up and slow down video;
* Being able to convert from one format into another seamlessly;
* An extensive amount of features are at your disposal.

Some of the drawbacks are that some settings are not configurable, like with YouTube's built-in editor. The main disadvantage, though, would be the lengthiness of the program's installation process: not only do you need to download FFmpeg itself but also three external libraries like libx264, libmp3lame, and libfaac; then you must compile all six packages before the installation completes. Luckily this process doesn't take very long.

Another possible disadvantage is the time required for downloading the various resources since they may not be readily available on standard file hosting sites such as Mediafire or Dropbox (though they can be found through third-party websites). If you're looking for something more robust than Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, we recommend checking out FFmpeg.

## Part 2\. How to Speed Up a Video in FFmpeg?

FFmpeg can be used to speed up videos. It's not the only option, but it's one of the most common ways to make your videos faster. If you want your video to be faster, then FFmpeg is the right tool for the job. Some speed-up features include: FFmpeg speed up video and audio, ffmpeg speed up video mp4, ffmpeg change video speed, and so on.

### The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide to speed up a video in FFmpeg

The presentation timestamp (PTS) of each video frame can be modified to alter the pace of a video stream.

Step1 Open a terminal and type in FFmpeg. This will open the program.

![open the program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-2.png)

Step2 Drag and drop the video file onto the window.

Step3 This is accomplished with the command -filter:v "setpts=."

Step4 According to the documentation, fast motion requires: -filter:v setpts=0.5\*PTS.

![fast motion requires](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-3.png)

Step5 Click Enter.

![click enter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-4.png)

Step6 The result would be a sped-up version of your video.

### Major approaches to speed up a video in Filmora

As we know that Filmora has the option to change the speed of a video, so let's find out step-by-step how to do that; you can also watch this [Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII):

### Method 1: Use the 'Fast' or 'Slow' option to change the speed

Just as simple as the heading is, this option is pretty straightforward, but you cannot decide how much speed you want to add to your video or how slow you want it to be.

### Method 2: Changing Uniform Speed in Wondershare Filmora

You need to check your video's FPS and import your clip first.

Pick your preferred video. Go to the menu and select "Download." After hitting the "Plus" button, you may maintain the video's quality by choosing "Match to Media."

![go to the menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-2.PNG)

After the movie has loaded, you have two options: double-clicking the clip or selecting the speed option provided below the screen.

![double clicking the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-3.PNG)

A window appears when we double-click the chosen video. We shall navigate to the "SPEED" section beneath this window. Additional "Uniform Speed" and "Speed Ramping" panels may be found on this speed panel. We shall operate within the uniform speed panel to alter the video's tempo consistently. A slider is provided for us to adjust the movie's pacing.

The general speed of the film is continually increased or decreased when we choose the option for constant pace. If we choose the speed option on the screen, it gives us a built-in range of numbers that we can use to change the video's pace in addition to presets like rapid and regular slow.

![rapid and regular slow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-4.PNG)

Once we click "OK," the video's tempo adjusts automatically.

### Method 3: Adjusting the Fast/Slow motion to fit your movie using the Speed Ramping option

To set up the speed ramping feature for your video, double-clicking the video will give us access to the "SPEED RAMPING" option in the speed panel. When we select the speed ramping option, we see a range of graphs. Each graph shows a number of tempo variations that we may use in our movie.

For Instance, when we select the "MONTAGE" preset, the video's tempo changes based on how many keyframes we choose and at what rate. As previously stated, as the graph rises above one and falls below one, the movie's tempo will slow down, increasing its regular speed.

Moving these keyframes higher will make the video go more quickly, while moving them downward will make the movie move more slowly. We may also add more keyframes by using the add button up top, as seen in the image. When satisfied with our results, we will produce the video after pressing the "OK" button.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the first thing you can do to speed up your video is to use FFmpeg. The FFmpeg project is a community-driven, non-profit collaborative project to develop and maintain an open-source code library for handling multimedia files, including video. It has many features including ffmpeg speed-up video, ffmpeg slow-down video, etc. FFmpeg is free software and supports many platforms, including Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.

Filmora is another great alternative that allows users to speed up their videos much more easily than using FFmpeg alone. Moreover, it has built-in tools that allow users to automatically detect if there are any issues with their videos. Filmora also offers a wide range of features that you may not find in FFmpeg.

### Major approaches to speed up a video in Filmora

As we know that Filmora has the option to change the speed of a video, so let's find out step-by-step how to do that; you can also watch this [Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII):

### Method 1: Use the 'Fast' or 'Slow' option to change the speed

Just as simple as the heading is, this option is pretty straightforward, but you cannot decide how much speed you want to add to your video or how slow you want it to be.

### Method 2: Changing Uniform Speed in Wondershare Filmora

You need to check your video's FPS and import your clip first.

Pick your preferred video. Go to the menu and select "Download." After hitting the "Plus" button, you may maintain the video's quality by choosing "Match to Media."

![go to the menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-2.PNG)

After the movie has loaded, you have two options: double-clicking the clip or selecting the speed option provided below the screen.

![double clicking the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-3.PNG)

A window appears when we double-click the chosen video. We shall navigate to the "SPEED" section beneath this window. Additional "Uniform Speed" and "Speed Ramping" panels may be found on this speed panel. We shall operate within the uniform speed panel to alter the video's tempo consistently. A slider is provided for us to adjust the movie's pacing.

The general speed of the film is continually increased or decreased when we choose the option for constant pace. If we choose the speed option on the screen, it gives us a built-in range of numbers that we can use to change the video's pace in addition to presets like rapid and regular slow.

Once we click "OK," the video's tempo adjusts automatically.

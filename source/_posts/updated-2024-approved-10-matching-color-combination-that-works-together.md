## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

![change the color of the outline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-7.png)

##### Step6 Create Multiple Outlines

It would help if you created multiple outlines to achieve the Neon Dance effect. These multiple outlines will be produced by exporting them multiple times with the color you want. Follow the below points to get it instantly!

* When you have selected the color for your outline, export the video by clicking on the **Export** icon in the top right corner.

![export the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-8.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Tip:** The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.

![offset the videos by a few seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-9.png)

To make the outlines glow like Neon lights, we will need to add another effect from the effects library.

* Go to the effects tab and search for "**Glow**."
* Click and **drag** the glow effect to each of the exported videos.

![add the glow effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-11.gif)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling.

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

## How to Easily Convert SRT to VTT

While there are numerous subtitle formats, two of the most commonly used formats are SRT and Web VTT. SRT is also known as SubRip. The format got its name from a DVD ripping software that extracted subtitles from DVDs.

Web VTT stands for Web Video Text Track. Web VTT is a W3C standard that allows you to display the text in sync with the HTML 5 <track> element.

Both of them are quite similar; however, slight differences might make you choose one over the other.

## Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?

While SRT is a popular text file used for captions, Web VTT is not far behind. Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.

Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let's dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:

### What Does It Look Like

Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file's title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.

![difference between srt vs vtt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-srt-to-vtt-1.jpg)

| **Features/Subtitle Formats**                  | SRT                                  | VTT                                              |

| **Metadata**                                   | No                                   | Yes                                              |
| **Title**                                      | No                                   | Yes                                              |
| **A Numbering of The Subtitle Lines**          | Yes                                  | No                                               |
| **Basic Text Formats**                         | Not supported                        | Yes                                              |
| **Advanced Styling Fonts**                     | Simple                               | More robust styling including bold, italics, etc |
| **Support Changing the position of subtitles** | No                                   | Yes                                              |

### Timecode Format

The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.

### Metadata

A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.

### Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)

Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.

### Advanced Styling Fonts

Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.

### Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles

Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.

### Summary

So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer. Apart from differences in styling, time, and text formats, Web VTT files are incredibly easier to read and edit. You can also add comments which will remain hidden from the display.

## How to Control the Speed of Video

Speed doesn't course at the same level for everyone. You can change momentum. You can slow it down and speed it up to convey a particular mood. In this article, you will learn how and when to control the speed of the video and its importance.

## Importance of Speeding up/Slowing Down Your video?

Speeding up or slowing it down, known as slow or fast motion, can make your video faster or slower than its actual speed, called speed ramping. Overall, adjusting the speed of video clips can enhance the video's visual effects, especially if you want to convey a particular mood to the audience. Speeding up your video may create a comical and dramatic impact, while slowing down your video can give viewers a time-lapse feel or an emotional mood.

This video speed controlling software can instantly speed up video up to 50x times. On the contrary, you can also slow down the video up to 0.1x, which means a one-minute video will run for 10 minutes.

How important is this Feature? The technique plays an essential role in adjusting the video's speed. You will appreciate this technique once you've started editing your video. At first, controlling the speed of your video without music will give you a plain or bare impression. Based on my experience, I cannot quickly identify which video part needs to control the speed. Still, once you've added music at the start, you can quickly determine when and where you should maintain the momentum based on the beat of the music.

## How to Speed up/Slow down a Video?

Nowadays, most video editing software offers an effortless way of giving special cinematic effects through speed ramping? Speed ramping is an approach to adjusting the clip's speed to send the message across and provide the audience with an element of confusion.

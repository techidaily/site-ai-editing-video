![click on the new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-a-new-project-on-filmora.jpg)

* Now let's import our video. Click on the "Import Media" section or drag and drop your video/audio file here to import it.

![click on the import media section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg)

* Once the media file has been imported, add it to the editing panel below with the drag-and-drop method. This is important to create a workspace for your video.

![drag the imported media down to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/drag-media-in-filmora-timeline.jpg)

* Now it's time to edit the video. Make all the editing you want with graphics and visuals to finalize your video before using the audio mixer. And once it's done, we can move to the first-class audio mixer of Filmora.

**Bonus Tip:** Before using the audio mixer, ensure you have a headphone to see the changes you are making instead of relying on your desktop speaker.

##### Step3Start the audio mixer

To open up the audio mixer, click on the "audio mixer" icon on the toolbar below the preview window.

![click on the audio mixer icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/start-audio-mixer-in-filmora.jpg)

This is what your audio mixer will look like at the start.

![audio mixer starting interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/audio-mixer-interface-in-filmora.jpg)

Now we can start adjusting the audio settings. Let's go with the audio levels first.

##### Step4Adjust the audio levels

To adjust the audio levels, look at the left side of the audio mixer. Here you'll see two vertical bars, which are;

* The audio levels for the video clip.
* The audio levels for the sound and music in the music track.

You can adjust the icon up or down to make these channels louder or softer.

![adjust the levels of your audio tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-levels-of-your-audio-tracks.jpg)

##### Step5Adjust the audio channels

See those circles above the audio levels? These are for adjusting the audio channels.

* Rotate the knob-like icon in these circles to adjust the Audio channels' pan/bounce control. This switches the sound between the left and right channels.
* On top of that, you can see these changes on the channel control panel.

![adjust the channels of your audio tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-channels-of-your-audio-tracks.jpg)

To check the effect, let's rotate the knob to the left. And to see the result hit the "Play" button on the bottom left corner of the audio mixer interface. Here's how it looks.

![preview of the adjusted audio tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/preview-of-the-adjusted-audio-tracks.gif)

Now it's time to select the audio mode.

##### Step6Select the audio mode

The audio mixer of Filmora provides you with two audio mode options. These are;

● **Stereo Mode**

In the Stereo mode, you can pan from left to right and control your audio just like the knob of the audio channel.

● **Surround Mode**

You can pan from left to right and front to back in this mode by rotating the video or music icons. This provides you with complete control over the audio positions. But remember that this mode works best if your video is played with the surround sound system.

![select the mode of your audio tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/select-the-mode-of-your-audio-tracks.jpg)

Once you have changed the audio mode, let's look at the master levels.

##### Step7Adjust the master levels

On the very left of the window, you'll find the Master levels.

This is where you can adjust the master section or all your audio files on your timeline.

* Just drag the master level slider upward and downwards, and you'll notice the changes right away.

![adjust the master levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-master-levels.jpg)

After carefully making all the changes to your audio, preview it for the last time before going with them. The "Play" button is still there in the bottom left corner.

Perfect!!! No? Make the changes again until you are satisfied and then hit the "Apply" button on the bottom right corner to adjust these changes.

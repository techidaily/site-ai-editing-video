Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the **Scale** and the **Position values** as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here.

For the **second keyframe**, just increase the **Scale** and adjust the **Position** value based on how it looks on the screen.

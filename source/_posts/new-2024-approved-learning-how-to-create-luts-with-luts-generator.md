## Learning How to Create LUTs with LUTs Generator

Lookup Tables can make your videos and pictures look more attractive. LUTs are like filters that give your media files different styles and emotions. There are many presets available on the internet that you can download to use for your media content. Moreover, LUTs help you to quickly change the look and mood of your photos and videos.

You can find LUTs for free or buy them online; some editing software already has LUTs included. Nevertheless, you can create your own LUTs using different online and offline tools. If you can't find any online LUT generator, search for LUT generator free download. You'll get many options allowing you to generate LUTs offline.

## Part 3: How to Create Online LUTs Using Online LUT Creator?

There are two methods to create a LUT online and offline. Previously you've learned to generate LUTs using offline tools. However, you can also create LUTs online without installing any tool. This portion will teach you how to create online LUTs in this step-by-step guide.

##### Step1

Import your photo into Lightroom by dragging and dropping it. You can also import the file by clicking the "File" button and selecting "Import Photos and Video." For best results, ensure that the photo you will edit is still.

##### Step2

Edit your photo inside the “Develop” module in Lightroom with your desired preference and style. Only apply changes affecting the colors, not adjustments like noise reduction, vignette, or grain.

## How to Change Frame Rate in Premiere Pro

The video's frame rate is an important aspect of it. Too high of a frame rate makes the video seem unnatural. On the other hand, too low can make some videos choppy. You can fix that by changing the frame rate using a video editor. And we are here to help you learn how to do that. Here's **how to change the frame rate in Premiere Pro.**

The frame rate sometimes makes or breaks the video. So it is important to get this setting right. Suppose you made a mistake and recorded your video in the wrong setting. You can follow this guide to solve your problem.

![check frame rate in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-premiere.JPG)

## How To Check Video Frame Rate in Premiere Pro

Before we teach you how to change a video's frame rate in Premiere Pro, let's first make sure you know how to check. Maybe you don't need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.

So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?

1. Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Check the "Media" window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for "frames per second," which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.

  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Reasons for Changing Frame Rate

Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.

Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.

However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the "soap opera effect." It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem "unnatural" or less cinematic.

High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That's great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it's also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.

With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video's frame rate.

## How To Change FPS in Premiere Pro

Let's dilly-dally no more. Here's a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.

### l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence

Suppose you want to keep the frame rate of most of the video the same. Only some parts need adjusting. You can change the frame rate of the sequences that need changing instead. Here are the steps to follow to achieve this:

1. Open your project in Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.
3. Choose "Sequence Settings" from the menu that appears.

1. Import your video clip to Premiere Pro and drag it to the timeline.
2. Go to the "Effects" tab. It's in the options at the bottom left of the screen.

## How To Make 120 FPS Videos With Premiere Pro

Videos that are 120 fps are very popular now. If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You'd want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.

Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it's a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That's obviously not the number that we want. Don't worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it's super easy.

Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:

1. Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, "Drop media here to create sequence."

![dragging video to premiere pro timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-120-fps-2.JPG)

1. Select the timeline panel. Click "Sequence" > "Sequence Settings."
2. Check the "Timebase" section. It should say "119.88 frames/second," 120 fps when rounded off.

![checking if the fps is 120](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-120-fps-4.JPG)

1. Edit the video as needed and render it. The output should stay at 120 fps.

### Plan your video

Ask yourself first of what you are trying to accomplish by producing the video. Remember that video is a tool and that it can hurt your channel if you don’t take it seriously and come properly prepared. Get organized and take down note if you have to.

Understand your target audience you need to know who you’ll be speaking to through your video content. Make sure that you really understand what you are doing, by this kind of video content is in need your expertise. You have to share to your audience what your knowledge and experience about your video topic. This is the time where its ok to make or create a script and to map out a storyboard to guide you.

### Write a script

Making a script in your video is one way guide for you not to rattle or messed up everything, for me DIY vlog is different from product reviews or unboxing vlog. You can either write a word-by-word script for the video or just the general topics you aim to cover in the video. Either way, the point is to have a reference note so you don’t accidentally forget to cover an essential topic when you begin filming the video. DIY vlogs need to plan and make scripting because this is a more on tutorial video and you don’t like to missed one instruction on your video that is why making a script is a must unless you already doing it over and over again. You don’t have to be perfect and you don’t have to memorize any script. You just have to be relatable and authentic, yet professional.

### Make You Video Short but full of information

Make your video short but demand more attentions to your viewers because modern viewers have short attention spans specially when they’re on social media and there is always another video to see. Just make sure to grab your viewers attention by creating a catching footage.

As long as you know well your topic then that’s good enough because it take some guts to get in front of the camera and be confident.

### Editing and Personalize your DIY Video

The last step is the process of editing and personalize your video content. There are a number of great video editing apps and programs out there, and with a quick internet search, you should be able to find one that meet your needs, skills level and budget. Editing is what really takes a video to the next level, use a powerful video editing software.

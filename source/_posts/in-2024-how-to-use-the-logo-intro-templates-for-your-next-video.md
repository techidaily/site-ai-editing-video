* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.

## People Also Ask

Before we bid you goodbye, let's answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.

### Q1\. What Is a Logo Intro?

You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn't know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company's logo that features before a movie.

Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.

### Q2\. What Is a Logo Reveal?

Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.

A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.

### Q3\. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?

You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.

![5 rules of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Unique**

It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else's. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else's logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.

**Simple**

Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.

**Versatile**

Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don't exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.

**Scalability**

It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.

**Balanced**

Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn't look aesthetically pleasing.

### Q4\. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?

The seven elements of a good logo include the following.

![7 elements of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Simplicity**

A simple design is far more superior to an overly complicated one. You could draw inspiration from brands like Nike.

**Memorability**

A good logo is one that your audience can remember off-head. Simple doesn't always have to mean simplistic.

Trends come and go, but a timeless logo will remain appropriate in the years to come. It is not uncommon for some brands to retain their logos for more than a decade.

**Relevance**

It would be wise to ensure your logo relates to your industry in one way or the other.

**High-quality typography**

The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.

**Well-balanced colors**

Your choice of colors can subconsciously influence your target audience's buying decisions and how they perceive you. For instance, blue communicates honesty and reliability, while yellow elicits feelings of happiness.

**Versatility**

Lastly, it would be wise to ensure that you can use your logo in numerous instances, like on a letterhead or on your social media platforms.

## Step by Step to Cut Video in Adobe Premiere Pro

Video editing is an essential skill in a world that has a growing focus on creative fields. And if you work with videos, knowing which clips to use and where to cut is essential in conveying your story and increasing its impact. So, if you are a beginner and want to familiarise yourself with steps and terms used in video editing, in this article, we will go through the steps you will need to cut your video file in Adobe Premiere Pro and Wondershare Filmora.

_This guide uses Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 and Wondershare Filmora X._

## How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Once you have Adobe Premiere Pro open on your computer, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Create a new project in Premiere Pro.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-1.jpeg)

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg)

You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create **Bins**, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg)

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an **In Point**and an **Out Point.** These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.

_We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below._

1. Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons \[marked in Yellow\] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.
1. You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.

If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons \[marked in Yellow\] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.
1. You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.

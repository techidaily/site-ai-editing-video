## 3 In-Camera Transitions Tricks To Make Videos Like a Pro

You must have seen it in videos when a scene changes to another place or time. How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.

Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.

You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Whip Your Camera

You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera's movement.

**Here is a stepwise guide for you to try**

1. Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.
2. Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.
3. For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.
4. Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.
5. Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.

You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.

The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:

## Fill The Frame

In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.

Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition

1. Plan the two shots you are going to take.
2. Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.
3. In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.
4. The second shot will take place at another time or place.
5. To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.
6. Import both shots into [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
7. Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.

## Match Cut

In a video, a match cut transitions from one shot to another. During this, the composition of the two shots is matched by action, subject, and subject matter. The goal is to make a visual match between two situations that don't have a direct link. Here are the steps to creating a match-cut transition in your videos.

1. Plan the shot you are going to take.
2. Record the action in the first shot, for example, clapping your hands.
3. Go to another place or scene to record the second shot.
4. Repeat the same action in the second shot.
5. Import both camera shots to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
6. Cut one shot to another when the action is at its peak.

This way, you can smoothly transition from one place or scene to another. There is a video attached below for a better understanding of the steps.

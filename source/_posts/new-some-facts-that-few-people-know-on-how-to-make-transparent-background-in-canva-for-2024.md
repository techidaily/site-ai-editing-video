FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.
* Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.

LUMEN5

Lumen5 is a video creation platform that is driven by artificial intelligence machine learning. Using this platform, you can easily turn any blog post into a video. To create a video, you simply enter your link to your blog post or article. Using natural language processing, Lumen5 will automatically create a storyboard for you. Machine learning is used to match each scene with media files that are relevant to your content. The length of each scene is basically dependent on the amount of text to display, and the text position is intelligently placed according to the scene composition to make sure everything is in order. Furthermore, important keywords are highlighted to draw audiences’ attention to key facts in the content. Lumen5 has helped over 200,000 businesses create over a million videos.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.

## Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro

We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let's discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.

* Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn't do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.
* Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.
* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.
* Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.
* The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don't bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.

You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.

### Q2\. What Is a Logo Reveal?

Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.

A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.

### Q3\. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?

You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.

![5 rules of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Unique**

It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else's. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else's logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.

**Simple**

Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.

**Versatile**

Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don't exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.

**Scalability**

It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.

**Balanced**

Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn't look aesthetically pleasing.

### Q4\. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?

The seven elements of a good logo include the following.

![7 elements of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Simplicity**

A simple design is far more superior to an overly complicated one. You could draw inspiration from brands like Nike.

**Memorability**

A good logo is one that your audience can remember off-head. Simple doesn't always have to mean simplistic.

**Timelessness**

Trends come and go, but a timeless logo will remain appropriate in the years to come. It is not uncommon for some brands to retain their logos for more than a decade.

**Relevance**

It would be wise to ensure your logo relates to your industry in one way or the other.

**High-quality typography**

The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.

**Well-balanced colors**

Your choice of colors can subconsciously influence your target audience's buying decisions and how they perceive you. For instance, blue communicates honesty and reliability, while yellow elicits feelings of happiness.

**Versatility**

Lastly, it would be wise to ensure that you can use your logo in numerous instances, like on a letterhead or on your social media platforms.

## Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro

We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let's discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.

* Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn't do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.
* Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.
* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.
* Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.
* The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don't bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

## Part 3\. FAQ

### 1\. What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )

The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG ). It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency. You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10's iMessage apps.

### 2\. How to Create APNG File?

**Step 1: Select Image**

Click File > Open to bring up the photo you wish to convert to PNG.

**Step 5: Compress**

The compression rate is set to "Best" by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.

![Compressed](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-21_16h58_41.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

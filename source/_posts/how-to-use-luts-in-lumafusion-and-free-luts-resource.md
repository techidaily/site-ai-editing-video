## How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion  & Free LUTs Resource

LumaFusion is one of the most complex iPad and iPhone video editing apps. Many of its customers adore it, and it has some incredible capabilities that you'd find incompetent editing software. They've effectively opened up the realm of LUTs to iPhone and iPad users.

LumaFusion LUTs are individual files that act as containers in LumaFusion. This container file includes standard LUT data as well as LumaFusion-specific color preset data. A LumaFusion LUT Preset file is similar to a Super LUT. LumaFusion can only employ one standard LUT at a time; however, LumaFusion LUT presets enable simultaneous Color Grading and Color Corrections.

## How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion

Colors in today's cameras are vibrant, but they may continuously be improved. Color correction corrects the color that's already there, whether it's boosting the exposure to brighten a darker photo or increasing the saturation to make the colors pop. Color correction in other NLEs can be difficult, but not in LumaFusion.

The Color Presets tab in the Color & Effects section is where you begin color correcting footage. There are various presets from which to pick. I wouldn't use these settings on my videos because they're too stylized, but they're there. You may alter any of the presets to your taste, so some of the more dramatic ones can be toned down. By picking the original setting, purists can color-fix their raw footage without using LumaFusion. Moving the sliders till the color seems perfect is all that's required from there.

Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, mid-tones, and saturation and hue are all controlled by sliders. The color sliders can be used for a more forceful approach. But proceed with caution. The sliders are delicate, and it's easy to overdo them. Play around with the sliders until you get the look you want. If you don't like it, toss it in the trashcan and start over.

Color grading and color correction are not interchangeable terms. Color correction is a technical requirement, but color grading is primarily creative. You'll have no command over the color grading process if you're working with film material where primary colors aren't even visible. Before diving into the creative LUTs, make sure you complete adequate color correcting.

Color grading, unlike color correction, adjusts the shot's color to modify the atmosphere or feel. The only way to do that in LumaFusion is to play around with the color sliders under the Color Presets tab, but that's not ideal. As previously stated, the three sliders are sensitive and limited. LumaFusion isn't designed for color grading, which is OK. Thankfully, LumaFusion allows you to use LUTs.

Always color correct your footage before utilizing any LUTS, which entails changing the White-balance, Highlights, Contrast, and Shadows. Do not apply the LUTS to your footage directly.

## How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?

Videographers, colorists, and editors use LUTs because they are efficient. Rather than starting from zero every time you work on a video editing project, you may speed up the color grading process using a LUT with predefined color profiles. It's elementary to import LUTs. Simply import the preset files into LumaFusion and add the preset to your footage like an Instagram filter.

The Import button in the Color & Effects editor is the easiest way to load LUTs.

1. Double click on any video/photo clip on the timeline to access the Clip Editors.
2. At the bottom of the Clip Editor UI, select the Color & Effects tab.
3. The import button is located directly below the effect preset library.

## What’re the Best Alternatives to Pexels?

Sites like Pexels provide you with royalty-free images to include in your messages to further their impact. Although Pexels is a great resource for royalty-free photos and animations, it is not without its limitations. Here is a list of Pexels alternatives for you to consider when creating content. It includes reasons why the sites are suitable alternatives and brief guides on how to get started on them.

## Part1: What are the best alternatives to Pexels?

There are several factors to consider when selecting a suitable image resource for your messaging. For example, you may consider a site favorable to another because of its intuitive user interface, or you may consider another because it has no pesky advertisements. Taking this into consideration, here is a list of the three best Pexels alternatives worth checking out for your next project.

### No.1 Unsplash

![unsplash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-1.jpg)

Unsplash is a stock photo-sharing website run by Getty Images. According to recent reports, the site hosts over 265,000 photographers contributing to a library of over 3.5 million photos. Initially, all photos were under a creative commons license zero, meaning you could distribute the photos without restriction. However, following lobbying from some creators, all photos are now under the Unsplash license.

This means you can still copy, modify, share, and download images for free. However, under the new licensing terms, you cannot use unedited copies of the images for commercial purposes such as T-Shirt printing or branding and using the photos on a similar or competing service.

Most Unsplash users praise it for the following features:

* The library contains tons of high-resolution photos.
* You can access the site through your web browser or the app available on Android and iOS devices.
* There are no download limits to the photos, and everything is free.
* Unsplash is a plugin for various content editing software such as Filmora 11, Adobe XD, and Figma.

Despite all the positives, here are a few improvements to make Unsplash even better.

* The website lacks a free HD video library, which would be a great addition for aspiring content creators.
* In addition, the search algorithm is not as accurate, and you may struggle to find suitable images for your subject matter.

### No.2 Shutterstock

Another Pexels alternative to consider is Shutterstock. It is an online resource where individuals and businesses can access high-quality, licensed photos, videos, illustrations, vectors, and music for their content creation.

![shutterstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-2.jpg)

Unlike Unsplash above, you need to create an account to access Shutterstock services. In addition, the website offers different pricing models for each user, depending on your unique requirements. For example, you can subscribe to an image-only subscription that allows you ten image downloads monthly for $29\. Alternatively, you can purchase the Mix and Match subscription that offers you 25 credits monthly to download different media from the site.

Currently, the website boasts a collection of over 200 million royalty-free images and over 10 million video clips. In addition, the company also offers a percentage-based compensation model to contributors, with first-timers earning up to 15% of content sales. Furthermore, the site continues to populate its library through the acquisition of different companies in a similar space. Some of its notable acquisitions include Turbosquid, Bigstock, Rex Features, and BEImages.

### No.3 Filmstock \[Editor's Choices\]

![filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-3.jpg)

Filmstock is an online library of different editing resources for filmmakers. Some of the resources you can obtain are effects, elements, titles, and audio. In addition, Filmstock is the most recent version of the formerly known Filmora Effects Store. Regardless of the close association with Filmora Video Editing Software, you can still use these resources in your creations on other programs.

Filmstock currently offers its services in three categories. They are:

* A Free package that allows you unlimited downloads of media effects and resources under a royalty-free license. However, any resource you download from the site comes with a Filmora tag.
* The Standard subscription will cost you $9.99 per month and includes free technical support as an additional feature to those available in the free package.
* Finally, the Premium subscription gives you access to the premium library that contains an exclusive selection of the contributors' commercial work. The package will cost you $32.99 monthly and also includes all the features in the previous subscription models.

Kindly note that you must register for a Filmstock or Wondershare account to use the service. In addition, you will need to purchase a separate license to use the service with Filmora Video Editing software.

### No.4 Getty Images

![getty images](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-4.jpg)

Getty Images is an online supplier of media resources for media, creative, and corporate clients. It boasts a resource library of over 477 million entries. Access to the site requires you to create a user account. In addition, some of the prints you will find on the site will require you to make a purchase, depending on the size and quality.

### No.5 iStock

![istock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-5.jpg)

iStock is an online library of creative resources, including music, videos, illustrations, and images. In addition, the site offers access to its exclusive stock-image library through different subscription models. Some of the platforms appealing features include the following:

* An AI-powered search engine that provides more accurate results than Pexels.
* Preset templates for easier creation of videos and social media posts.

### No.6 Flickr

![flickr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-6.jpg)

Flickr is another alternative to Pexels worth considering. This is because it offers you free and paid access to one of the internet's largest creative libraries. In addition, you can select from several licenses, including creative commons and U.S. Government works licenses for your assets, something other similar sites lack in their offering.

### No.7 Pixabay

![pixabay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-7.jpg)

Pixabay gives you access to over 1 million creative assets in different categories, including videos, music, and sound effects. In addition, the site offers its content under the creative commons zero licenses, meaning you can use all stock photos without fear of backlash. Although the site's search function requires work on its accuracy, the numerous categories make it easier to pinpoint your desired image.

### No.8 Adobe Stock

![adobe stock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-8.jpg)

Another site like Pexels is Adobe Stock, where you can access millions of creative assets for your content. Depending on your licensing options, the site offers free and paid access to its services. For example, you can increase your creativity by subscribing to the different Adobe design assets, including Adobe Stock Vector and Adobe Stock Illustrations.

### No.9 Vista Create

![vista create](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-9.jpg)

Vista Create is an online free photo and image website like Pexels that also includes design tools to alter the images to your liking. In addition, you have plenty of templates to suit different platform requirements, including social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. Furthermore, Vista Creare also boasts a wide collection of vectors, which you can customize in three easy steps.

### No.10 LibreStock

![librestock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-10.jpg)

Unlike the ones above, LIbreStock is an aggregator site that combines stock photo databases in a single platform. As such, it is arguably the largest provider of royalty-free images on the web. In addition, it automatically filters out poor-quality images, guaranteeing you excellence each time.

Most LibreStock users name the website's search function as its best feature. This is because it also utilizes search tags when scanning through different databases. As such, you can easily find unique stock photos for your creation, regardless of how outrageous the search tag is. Finally, LibreStock provides its content under the creative commons zero licenses, meaning you can use the assets for personal and commercial work.

### No.11 StockSnap

![stocksnap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-11.jpg)

StockSnap operates similarly to Pexels, as it also offers a variety of free stock photos and images. However, a few tweaks to how you receive these creative assets make it slightly better. For example, StockSnap allows you to download ten free images from Shutterstock if what you need is unavailable in their library.

In addition, the platform also displays the most recent additions to their library in the top search results. As such, you are guaranteed to receive unique pictures without significant overuse.

## Part2: FAQs

### What is better than Pexels?

From the above information, Unsplash ranks as the best alternative to Pexels. This is because of its user-friendly interface, availability across web-based and smartphones, and compatibility with different video editing software such as Adobe XD and [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). As such, its versatility allows you to always create on the go.

### Can I use Pexels on YouTube?

Yes, you can use Pexels on YouTube, provided you apply the creative assets to your material. In addition, you will need to make alterations to Pexels images and videos before using them to avoid violating your license agreement.

## How to Create a Custom Sequence Preset in Premiere Pro

You've probably heard of Adobe Premiere Pro – it's a top-tier video editing software that's widely recognized in the market. But have you delved into the nitty-gritty of sequence presets? A custom sequence preset is your best friend for maintaining consistency across projects.

It allows users to save specific settings for sequence attributes like frame rate, resolution, and audio settings. Instead of reconfiguring these settings for each new project, a custom sequence preset lets you jump right into editing. Now, how do you create one? Keep reading!

## Part 1: How to Create a Custom Sequence in Premiere Pro

Creating a custom sequence is like tailoring a shirt to fit you perfectly. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do just that:

### Step 1: Displays the New Sequence Window

Begin by launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once opened, navigate to the top menu and select **_File_ \> _New_ \> _Sequence_**. This will open up the New Sequence window, where all the magic happens!

### Step 2: Change the Editing Mode to Custom in the Settings Panel

You'll see several tabs in the New Sequence window, but we will focus on the **"Settings"** tab for our purposes. Click on it.

Here, you'll find the **'Editing Mode'** dropdown menu. By default, it's set to a specific format like **'DSLR'** or **'AVCHD**.' Change this to 'Custom.' This will unlock a plethora of options for you to play with.

**Deep Dive into Settings:**

1. **Frame Size:** Define your video’s width and height. Remember, 1920x1080 is Full HD, and 3840x2160 is 4K. Choose based on your project needs.
2. **Frame Rate:** 24fps is the cinematic standard, but if you're creating content for TV or web, 30fps or 60fps might be more suitable.
3. **Pixel Aspect Ratio:** Stick with **'Square Pixels'** unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
4. **Fields:** Choose 'No Fields' for progressive footage. If you're unsure, this is a safe bet.
5. **Audio Settings:** Here, you can configure the sample rate, among other things. 48000Hz is standard for video.

### Step 3: Give the New Preset a Name and Save It

Once you've customized the settings to your satisfaction, it's time to save this configuration for future use. At the bottom of the New Sequence window, you’ll see a **'Save Preset'** button. Click on it.

A pop-up window will show up, requesting you to provide a name for your new preset. Choose something descriptive so you can easily recognize it later. Once named, click **'OK'**.

Your custom sequence preset is now saved and will appear under the **'Custom'** folder in the **'Sequence Presets'** tab.

## Part 2: Why Custom Sequence Presets are Essential for Efficient Editing

As you delve deeper into video editing, you'll begin to appreciate the little things that shave off minutes from your workflow, allowing you to dedicate more time to the creative process. This is precisely where the utility of custom sequence presets in Premiere Pro comes into play. But why are these presets so crucial?

* **Consistency Across Projects:** If you’re managing multiple projects or a series of videos, having a standard format ensures that all your content has a uniform look and feel. Consistency is a hallmark of professional-grade content. It's not just about the visuals – maintaining a uniform audio quality and format is equally significant. With a preset, you no longer need to remember the minutiae of each setting, ensuring consistency effortlessly.
* **Speed Up Your Workflow:** Every minute you spend adjusting the sequence settings is a minute less you have for cutting, color correcting, audio mixing, or adding those special effects that make your videos pop. Over time, those minutes can add up to hours. By using a custom sequence preset, you can jump straight into the creative part of editing without the preliminary setup.
* **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Have you ever rendered an entire project only to find that the frame rate was off or the audio was set to the wrong sample rate? These kinds of errors can occur when setting up a new sequence from scratch each time. By relying on a preset, you mitigate the risks of such oversights.
* **Personalized Templates for Different Platforms:** Different platforms may have varying preferred settings. For instance, the ideal video format for YouTube might differ from that of Instagram or TikTok. Instead of Googling these settings each time, you can have a custom sequence preset ready for each platform, ensuring your content is optimized wherever it's destined.
* **Ease of Collaboration:** If you're working as part of a team, having standard sequence presets ensures everyone is on the same page. This is particularly handy when multiple editors are working on different segments of the same project. With custom presets, you're not just aligning sequences but also visions.

Incorporating this practice into your editing routine might initially seem trivial, but its benefits compound with time.

## Part 3: Summary

Creating a custom sequence preset in Adobe Premiere Pro isn’t just about streamlining your workflow – it’s about ensuring consistency across your projects.

By saving your most-used settings, you're creating a base template that can be pulled up any time, granting you more time for the creative process.

Adobe Premiere Pro's interface is designed to make tasks like these intuitive, so even if you're a beginner, with a bit of practice, you'll be creating custom sequence presets like a pro.

## How To Make A Do-It-Yourself Video

Wondering how YouTubers make their own video from scratch? Want to open a YouTube channel and you don’t know how to start? Then, in this article; I’ll explain you the details. Please stay with me.

If you love to speak in front of the camera as if anyone is watching you, and if you’re someone with low self-esteem like me, and you want to develop your self-confidence, then you’re on the right track. People nowadays look for something that can add spice to their life like vlogging. But first, you need to know the reasons why you're opening a YouTube channel in the first place. Have a me time and ask yourself what do you want to share with your target audiences.

Things that can be of great influence to someone who badly needed it (in a positive way of course.) People nowadays search answers to their questions on YouTube. It is the second largest search engine next to Google and because of the YouTubers who give fuel to it, people around the globe watch it on a daily basis, I’m sure of it.

And now that you’ve already know what you want to share outside the world, you just need your vlogging equipment's.

1. [Videos Are Impactful](#part2-1)
2. [People Access Video Everywhere](#part2-2)
3. [You Don’t Need a Fortune to Produce Videos](#part2-3)

* [Preparations for a Vlog](#part3)

## Part 1\. Things That You Need when You Want to Start Vlogging

A smart phone and a tripod will do. You don’t need to have all those professional vlogging equipment's if you’re a new YouTuber. Each and every smart phone now can record a high-definition resolution. I started with my Samsung S6 and a pile of books as my tripod. Silly me! But you need to be resourceful. As the time went by, I bought a tripod from JOOM (an online store just like Ali Express). Very cheap and it last long. You also need a video editor for post editing. You don’t want to upload a raw video on YouTube without anything in it. It will be dull and boring.

## Part 2\. Reasons Why You Need a Video Editor?

### 1\. Videos Are Impactful

While pictures can tell a thousand words, video tells a thousand more. On your videos, your audiences can see your feelings about a particular topic, and with the correct techniques and editing secrets, you can effectively tell someone or many people a message you want to get across. Whether it is a message on how to make a do-it-yourself video or what is the best video editor for beginners?

### 2\. People Access Video Everywhere

You are probably one who does too. In this modern era of technology, you see people watching videos not only on television or the computer but on their laptops, tablets and smart phones as well. So, if you want something across, putting out your message or promotion through a video to these people makes sense. And it does not have to be that hard. You might say people only want to watch good looking videos. Well, yes, but using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video editing software can let your video look more professional.

### 3\. You Don’t Need a Fortune to Produce Videos

That's right. If you have a video editor installed on your phone, you’re ready to go. I started to edit my first ever video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) go. It’s very handy and easy to use for a beginner like me before. And it has lot of features that you can put in your video, like cool titles, transitions and even stickers. If you want to produce your video using your computer or a laptop, you can definitely use Wondershare Filmora. You probably will not be able to edit and produce “Hollywood” videos but with a decent computer or laptop and correct editing techniques, you can make pretty professional looking videos. I always recommend using Wondershare Filmora even if you’re a beginner. If you learn how to use Wondershare Filmora well, you can make videos compared to everyone else. I guarantee you that.

## Part 3\. Preparations for a Vlog

I take down notes when preparing a video, I used to write the things that I need to say. Things that I mostly want to highlight when expressing my thoughts to everyone who will watch it.

![do it yourself video prepare](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/do-it-yourself-video-prepare.jpg)

I put myself a little make up on when producing a video, it makes me feel more confident to speak in front of my virtual audiences because I know that I looked presentable in any way.

Now we need to set our do-it-yourself like studio (it can be your room; it can be in the living room or anywhere that you can see that has a good background) or you can use a green backdrop and just make wonders in the post editing.

![how to make a do it yourself video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-make-a-do-it-yourself-video.jpg)

During these days, I’m filming using my Canon GX7 Mark II and it’s a result of my first ever YouTube salary. When you’re into vlogging, at some point you need to upgrade your vlogging equipment's. I know it will take time, but you can do it.

After you finished a vlog/video, you need to edit it and that’s the most exciting part for me, at least. Put your teaser, your intro, the body of the video itself and don’t forget the outro.

![do it yourself video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/do-it-yourself-video-editing.jpg)

## Conclusions

If you want to open up a YouTube Channel, then do it now. Maybe you’ll feel down because people around you will not support you from the beginning and that’s the cruel part of being a YouTuber. As the saying goes by, “birds of the same feather, flock together”; people with the same passion as you can understand all your endeavors. Don’t always think of the money that you will receive afterwards because that brings pressure and you’ll push yourself to the limit until you’ll feel and say “enough is enough”. Just do your own thing and the rest will follow. And if you think that you have something to offer to someone out there virtually, then don’t think twice. We only live once, make the most out of it.

And if you’re looking for the best video editor for Personal Computers this year 2022, choose [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and you’ll be thrilled. Trust me, I’ve been there. Happy editing!

## How to Use Twixtor Effect to Add Slow-Motion Effect to Video?

Twixtor is a plug-in program for the After Effects software that allows you to [create slow-motion effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from any video clip by adjusting the settings of the plug-in software. But what Twixtor is and why it is utilized are the topics we will cover in this article.

In addition, we will learn how to manipulate its characteristics to get the best possible outcome for our working composition in the Premiere Pro and After Effects plug-ins. Without any further ado, let's get straight to the business!

#### In this article

01 [What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?](#part1)

02 [How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?](#part2)

03 [How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?](#part3)

04 [How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?](#part4)

## Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?

Twixtor is a plug-in developed by RevisionFX. It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.

Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel's motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.

Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!

When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.

But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).

The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.

The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.

## Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?

As we've already mentioned, we will be analyzing how Twixtor makes slow mos; we will be starting with the Adobe Premiere Pro. The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.

**Step 1**: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.

![nest sequence premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nest-sequence-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2:** Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.

**Step 3:** Go to the Effects tab and search for Twixtor, and then drop the Twixtor Pro to the video clip in the timeline.

![twixtor pro effect premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twixtor-pro-effect-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 5:** Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to **Show Clip Keyframes** to enable the **Speed** option under **Time Remapping**. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.

**Step 6**: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.

![add keyframes to slow motion premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-keyframes-to-slow-motion-premiere-pro.jpg)

Step 7: Now, drag the line lower to add a slo-mo effect to video.

![drag line to slow motion twixtor premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-line-to-slow-motion-twixtor-premiere-pro.jpg)

Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage. To avoid that, utilize settings in a better way to ensure your video works flawlessly.

## Part 3: How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?

When working with After Effects software, Twixtor is a convenient plug-in since it allows us to create slow-motion effects from any video source.

We'll look at an example to better comprehend what we're talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software's operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.

**Step 1:** When you launch **After Effects**, go to **File>Import>File** to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting **New Comp from Selection**.

**Step 2:** Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects & Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.

![after effects twixtor slow motion plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-twixtor-slow-motion-plugin.jpg)

**Step 3**: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.

For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the "**tree-ing**" concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under **Source Control**. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.

![adjust after effects twixtor pro settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-after-effects-twixtor-pro-settings.jpg)

You can then adjust the speed and time remap mode accordingly. For more information, you can watch the video tutorial below to find out how to create smooth Twixtor effects in Adobe After Effects.

## Part 4: How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?

It is possible to shoot videos in slow motion and then play them back at average speed using [SloPro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slopro/id507232505) – 1000fps Slow Motion Video from Sand Mountain Studios, a fantastic video editing effects tool.

Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.

SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.

This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.

![slopro slow motion app iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slopro-slow-motion-app-iphone.jpg)

**Step 1**: After you've imported your video, click on the **red Edit** button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.

**Step 2**: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the **Clip In** and **Clip Out** functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.

**Step 3**: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and **slow speed** choices. **Drag the cursor** over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.

Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose **Optical Flow** from the menu.

This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program's free version, but you can easily crop it out.

**Conclusion**

Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn't child's play. So, we decided to compile this article to inform our worthy readers on how they can get started using Twixtor on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. We hope you had a fun time learning!

Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!

When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.

But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).

The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.

The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.

## Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?

As we've already mentioned, we will be analyzing how Twixtor makes slow mos; we will be starting with the Adobe Premiere Pro. The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.

**Step 1**: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.

**Step 5:** Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to **Show Clip Keyframes** to enable the **Speed** option under **Time Remapping**. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.

**Step 6**: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.

Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage. To avoid that, utilize settings in a better way to ensure your video works flawlessly.

## Part 3: How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?

When working with After Effects software, Twixtor is a convenient plug-in since it allows us to create slow-motion effects from any video source.

We'll look at an example to better comprehend what we're talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software's operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.

**Step 1:** When you launch **After Effects**, go to **File>Import>File** to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting **New Comp from Selection**.

**Step 2:** Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects & Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.

**Step 3**: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.

For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the "**tree-ing**" concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under **Source Control**. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.

You can then adjust the speed and time remap mode accordingly. For more information, you can watch the video tutorial below to find out how to create smooth Twixtor effects in Adobe After Effects.

## Part 4: How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?

It is possible to shoot videos in slow motion and then play them back at average speed using [SloPro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slopro/id507232505) – 1000fps Slow Motion Video from Sand Mountain Studios, a fantastic video editing effects tool.

Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.

SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.

This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.

![slopro slow motion app iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slopro-slow-motion-app-iphone.jpg)

**Step 1**: After you've imported your video, click on the **red Edit** button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.

**Step 2**: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the **Clip In** and **Clip Out** functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.

**Step 3**: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and **slow speed** choices. **Drag the cursor** over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.

Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose **Optical Flow** from the menu.

This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program's free version, but you can easily crop it out.

**Conclusion**

Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn't child's play. So, we decided to compile this article to inform our worthy readers on how they can get started using Twixtor on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. We hope you had a fun time learning!

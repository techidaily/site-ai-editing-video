## Part 1: What is SRT?

An SRT is one of the most common formats used in subtitling or captioning files. 'SRT' refers to a 'SubRip Subtitle' file, which originated from the DVD-ripping software by the same name. [SubRip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) would extract or rip subtitles and timings from live video, recorded video, and DVDs.

SRT has four major components:

1. A numeric counter indicates the number or position of the subtitle.
2. A Start and end time of the subtitle which is separated by the characters.
3. A Subtitle in one or more lines.
4. A blank line indicates the ending of the subtitle.

Now that you know about SRT let's understand why you should convert your Word file to SRT.

**How to add timestamps**:

There are two ways to add timestamps in the file.

1. **Either add timestamps manually in the word document.**

To write timecodes, the format used is Hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds and milliseconds being rounded to 3 decimal places. Separate each timestamp with a two-hash arrow (written as - ->) and a blank line indicates the next caption sequence. After saving, these files are named with .srt extension.

1. **Or edit the SRT file after creating it using a video editor which has the ability to edit SRT.**

You can also edit the SRT file after creating it by using video editing software such as [Happy Scribe’s](https://www.happyscribe.com/). It has audio-to-text/video-to-text feature that includes multiple timestamps options.

### Language Conversion Feature of SRT file

You can use this to convert each line of your subtitles from one language to another. It also supports language conversion between English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, etc. It's an easy process.

In any of the two cases mantioned above, you need to convert Word document in to SRT. Let’s find out how can you do that without using any software.

Follow the below steps to convert a word file to SRT without any software.

##### Step1 Open your Docx file

For this, open the word document you want to convert.

##### Step2 Change it to a .TXT document

Then from the left corner, Click on File>save as> and select the “Text” to convert it.

![save docx as text document](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-word-to-srt-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is SRT?

An SRT is one of the most common formats used in subtitling or captioning files. 'SRT' refers to a 'SubRip Subtitle' file, which originated from the DVD-ripping software by the same name. [SubRip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) would extract or rip subtitles and timings from live video, recorded video, and DVDs.

SRT has four major components:

1. A numeric counter indicates the number or position of the subtitle.
2. A Start and end time of the subtitle which is separated by the characters.
3. A Subtitle in one or more lines.
4. A blank line indicates the ending of the subtitle.

Now that you know about SRT let's understand why you should convert your Word file to SRT.

## Part 2: Why Should You Convert Word to SRT?

Most subtitles on the Internet are distributed in SRT format. Moreover, media players, lecture capture software, and video recording software are compatible with the SRT format.

Also, user frequently asks from forum like:

“I received a docx. file with subtitles already translated and the corresponding YouTube video URL. I was asked to proofread and then embed the subtitles into the video.”

To solve this, you can not only save it as a TXT document and change the file extension to .SRT, but also, a much easier way, convert subtitles from Microsoft Word files to SRT format through a easy-to-use SRT converter.

## Part 3: How to Convert a Word file to an SRT file without the software?

**Before we dive into the concrete steps guide, here are things we need to be considered:**

### Timestamp issue

Timestamps identify the exact point in an audio or video where the given text was spoken.

Now we know what a timestamp is and why it's important. Let's find out how to add timestamps in the SRT file.

**How to add timestamps**:

There are two ways to add timestamps in the file.

1. **Either add timestamps manually in the word document.**

To write timecodes, the format used is Hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds and milliseconds being rounded to 3 decimal places. Separate each timestamp with a two-hash arrow (written as - ->) and a blank line indicates the next caption sequence. After saving, these files are named with .srt extension.

1. **Or edit the SRT file after creating it using a video editor which has the ability to edit SRT.**

You can also edit the SRT file after creating it by using video editing software such as [Happy Scribe’s](https://www.happyscribe.com/). It has audio-to-text/video-to-text feature that includes multiple timestamps options.

### Language Conversion Feature of SRT file

You can use this to convert each line of your subtitles from one language to another. It also supports language conversion between English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, etc. It's an easy process.

In any of the two cases mantioned above, you need to convert Word document in to SRT. Let’s find out how can you do that without using any software.

Follow the below steps to convert a word file to SRT without any software.

##### Step1 Open your Docx file

For this, open the word document you want to convert.

##### Step2 Change it to a .TXT document

Then from the left corner, Click on File>save as> and select the “Text” to convert it.

![save docx as text document](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-word-to-srt-1.jpg)

##### Step3 Save an SRT file

After converting it into a TXT (text) document, rename it by replacing the suffix "Txt '' with "SRT .''

If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,

1. Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer
2. Go to view
3. Click on the check box for “File name extensions”

![check file name extensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-word-to-srt-2.jpg)

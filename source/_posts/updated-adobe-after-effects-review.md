## 1\. Speed and Stability

When talking about speed and stability, After Effects has the latest release packed with improvements. All the developers have focused themselves on speed and also performance. The team at Adobe have worked very hard to make this application more responsive and when we go along in this article, that can be seen in many ways

The main improvement which is immediately clear to all users, is the renewed preview playback optimization. What we noticed is that After Effects is creating the ram preview for your projects a lot faster. However, while working with the software for this article, we did find the user interface to be more responsive, the playback is way smoother, so is it a lot more stable overall.

While using shape layers, there was a significant improvement. A few expressions are a lot faster. This alone is worth upgrading to the latest version of After Effects.

![speed and stability](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adobe-after-effects-review-02.jpg)

## 2\. User Interface

The After Effects interface is constructed up of four main parts. The Timeline panel, the Project panel, the Composition panel and the Effects panel.

### The Timeline Panel

In the Timeline panel, you edit all the footage and clips to create your rough cut. You can find the Timeline panel on the bottom of the workspace.

### The Project Panel

It's pretty straightforward that in the Project panel you import your footage and create your project. This is located on the top left of the standard After Effects workspace.

### The Composition Panel

The Composition panel is where you will see the final product. This is located in the middle of your workspace.

### The Effects Panel

In order to make creative changes to your video, use the preview, audio, effects, and Preset Panels. These panels are located on the upper right area of your workspace, each one also has its dropdown.

## 3\. Learning Curve

The learning curve for After Effects depends on your background, the best way to find out if you like it is starting a free trial. Go through some tutorials online or paid courses. You'll also want to spend time with the User Guide. The Search Help field in the top right corner provides you an easier search for answers to most questions that you have. Speaking of YouTube and online learning, most of the video tutorials you will find have been created by people that are experienced in After Effects and know their way around it.

## 4\. VFX

There's a time-period when video editors require strengthening their skills, calling it imperative software for improving editing skills is nowhere near an exaggeration. it really helps prospective professionals improve their learning experience through visual effects, camera tracking, text animation, motion tracking, color grading, etc. All of these methodologies do help in improving the VFX learning process in the long run.

Video editing happens to be a crucial part of film production. Making videos in a fantastic process can indulge in building professional videos via motion graphics animation. This is where Adobe After Effects become an excellent learning tool.

## 5\. Motion Graphics

Motion graphics can sound quite scary. It's a new term for a specific genre of animation. Motion graphics is the intersection between animation and graphic design. These are purpose-driven visual aspects with the goal of showing information to the viewer through the use of animated graphics or text. Sometimes they include voice-overs narrating what the text or graphics are showing. Where it gets a little complex is that the more popular the term motion graphics becomes, the more people are misaligning animations to it. They need to represent information and illustrate the idea to the viewer clearly, so they do that using animation and motion graphics.

## 6\. Titles and Outros

Adobe released a new combination of features for you. For Adobe Stock: Graphics templates. Those pre-made templates give you a super smooth way to discover new motion graphics within Premiere Pro, without needing to spend time creating titles, overlays, or animations from scratch. The world has digitalized, and videos often need visual aspects such as titles, lower thirds, to present information. The templates not only assist video editors increase the quality of the content by showing certain information, but they also give a strong visual touch to keep the viewer engaged throughout the video. The audience nowadays is a lot more sophisticated, meaning that motion graphics are a necessity in a driven media world.

Motion Graphics templates are valuable for video editors of all levels. For the beginning content creators, the templates offer great quality, ready-made footage to help their creative goal. They can explore and work on their skills. Motion graphics that are pre-made are an excellent way to express the vision and express inspiration to new opportunities.

So now that you are aware of what After Effects templates are, we can move on to the actual workflow, why it is important, and how to use it as efficient as possible.

## 7\. Workflow

Whether you are using Adobe After Effects to create motion graphics, or composite realistic visuals, you usually follow the same workflow, you may repeat the process of adjusting layer properties, editing, and compositing until everything looks good. You can change any property of any element, such as position, opacity and size. Make use of motion tracking to stabilize footage so that it follows the motion from another clip, and so much more!

## 8\. Rendering Speed

When it comes to exporting your project in After Effects, you don't need to buy an expensive workstation. You can speed up your rendering process from your own laptop without investing too much and by using the following tips we have for you below!

### Tip #1: Enable Multiprocessing

What exactly is multiprocessing? That is when After Effects uses multiple cores from your CPU to export multiple frames at once. If your processor has one or more cores, you can enable this feature to reduce your rendering time. We want to mention that you need to check whether or not this option is turned on. Once enabled, you'll see a great decrease in export time.

To enable Multiprocessing, navigate to Preferences > Memory & Multiprocessing. Then you click the check box next to 'Render Multiple Frames Simultaneously' and remember also to adjust the settings that you need.

### Tip #2: Optimize Your RAM Usage

The RAM memory inside your workstation can be used to write and read data at a lot higher speeds than regular hard drives and portable drives. Configuring your RAM in a system is one of the easiest upgrades for better performance. Giving you affordable solutions for both desktop and laptop systems, the RAM memory upgrade does not require a lot of knowledge. The more RAM you allow applications to use, the higher the performance you will get out of it.

It also shows a noticeable increase in rendering speed. When the export time in your work is longer than needed, look at your RAM memory and see if you can make the necessary changes or upgrades.

### Tip #3: Use the Media Encoder

Let's talk about the Media Encoder. It's the software that comes up with Adobe Creative Cloud products such as After Effects and Premiere Pro to simplify the export process. You can easily render your project from After Effects to Adobe Media Encoder and begin the project render process from that point on. The Media Encoder will increase your rendering performance and will significantly decrease rendering time.

### Tip #4: Disable Ray-Traced 3D

The included After Effects Ray-Traced 3D feature enables you to produce 3D models within After Effects without any struggle. Calculating all the motions and visual graphics is such a heavy process for your workstation. When you disable raytracing, you will get a faster export time. By looking that 'Classic 3D' is checked instead of 'Ray-Traced 3D' from your composition preferences, you can speed your rendering speed up to 50%. Isn't that incredible?

![disable ray traced 3d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adobe-after-effects-review-03.jpg)

### Tip #5: Activate GPU Exporting with Cuda Acceleration

Exporting your videos with GPU rather than CPU will increase the efficiency of your render process. The export length will decrease a whole lot when you activate Mercury GPU Acceleration, also known as 'CUDA' from the 'Project Settings'.

After Effects doesn't really require CUDA features from a special kind of Nvidia GPU. Only the GPU accelerated 3D renderer, that is based on the raytracing algorithm, requires that. The other GPU features are running on any GPU that meets the basic minimums, including Intel and AMD GPUs.

## 9\. System Requirements for Windows

These are the minimum specifications needed to use After Effects on PC:

**OS:** Windows 10 (64-bit) versions 1909 and later, or Windows 11

**CPU:** Intel or AMD Quad-Core Processor (Intel i5 and i7 will do the job)

**RAM:** 16 GB

**Monitor resolution:** 1280 x 1080

An internet connection

**Free storage:** 15 GB

**GPU:** Minimum 2 GB of VRAM

## 10\. System Requirements for macOS

**OS:** macOS 10.13 or later

**RAM:** 16 GB

**CPU:** Intel and Apple Silicon (Rosetta2 Supported) Quad-Core Processor

**GPU:** 2GB of VRAM

**Monitor resolution:** 1440×900

**Free storage:** 15 GB

An internet connection

## 11\. Keyboard Shortcuts

You can work visually when you configure your keyboard shortcuts with the visual keyboard shortcut editor within After Effects. You can use the keyboard user interface to show the keys that have been assigned to shortcuts, the available keys for assignment, and edit assigned shortcuts to make your workflow even easier.

## 12\. Should You Buy It?

Well first, you cannot buy After Effects, Premiere Pro or other software from Adobe. You have to rent them by paying monthly. After Effects is primarily a compositing and graphics software. Premiere is primarily a video editing program. In the case of After Effects and Premiere Pro, it's not really an either/or. They're both software with different purposes. After Effects is a lot more powerful and essentially showcases most of Premiere's functionality, but according to our experience, the Premiere Pro interface and workflow is way more superior for video editing.

Premiere Pro is essentially built around its timeline, the region where you cut your video clips and drag and place them into your appropriate sequence. Hollywood filmmakers and professional YouTube content creators are using Premiere Pro to edit high-performing content and award-winning films. The software is very intuitive and easy for beginners to start with.

Are going to work with After Effects to create an income? Or are just going to use it for a hobby? It's crucial to mention that question because Adobe After Effects is not something that is cheaply available. You will be investing much money on the program, and if you are working to use the software, paying a good amount, and earning nothing in return, then you might want to shift to another alternative which would cost you less. For instance, let's assume you are using the application to earn an income, and have a few low-paying clients. In such a situation, you will have to rethink your options of software and analyze whether what you are paying in comparison to what you are getting is enough for you or not. We all are different individuals and have different preferences. Once we can see what is more important to us, or what is our need at this moment, then we will be able to judge the worth of purchasing Adobe After Effects better.

Are you going to use After Effects to earn an income? Or are just using it as a hobby? It is very important to address this question because Adobe After Effects is not something cheaply accessible. You will be investing a lot of money into this software, if you are using the software while paying a good amount and earning nothing in return yet, then you could shift to a different alternative which will cost you a lot less. Let's say you are using After Effects to earn an income and have some low-paying work. In that case, you will have to reconsider your options of video editing software and look at whether what you are paying in comparison to what you are getting is possible for you. When we can see what is more important to us, we will be able to see the worth of buying After Effects.

Did you previously use After Effects or are you new to the program? The return that you will get using Adobe After Effects, depends on how good you know how to work with the options, functions and features in the software.

### The Bottom Line

So summing it all together, Adobe After Effects takes care of all your assets and creates a final product, considering that After Effects is usually an asset-generation tool. Most video editors complete their projects in After Effects non-stop. It's excellent for making visual videos come to life.

AE version 22.3 is very impressive. Giving you a wealth of new features created to make VFX editing a lot faster and easier. Offering new features on a regular basis, improving their subscription model making it more attractive. Especially if you're a professional editor and designer.

Once you get comfortable with Adobe After Effects, you learn how to dynamically combine After Effects compositions to your Premiere projects. You are able to access both assets at the same time if needed!

## What Is Motion Tracking and How to Use It

Motion tracking makes it easier to follow the movement of objects and provide the sensed data to a program for additional processing. Motion tracking involves recording an object's movements that match a previously stored motion template. This has a wide range of uses, including in robotics, entertainment, sports, the military, and the entertainment industry. Additionally, it is utilized in the creation of video games and films. While motion tracking is frequently referred to as match movement in the film and video game industries, motion tracking is frequently referred to as motion capture in other contexts.

## Part 1\. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking

We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let's quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,

Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion  
Add text or solids as additional compositional elements  
Add 3D elements to 2D footage  
Use effects or color gradation methods  
Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television

These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.

## Part 2\. What software do you need?

There are numerous options for motion tracking applications. With advantages and downsides, we've compiled a list of the finest motion tracking programs. The following are the best video editors for motion tracking in our opinion:

### Filmora

### Blender

Open-source and cost-free motion tracking software is called Blender. It's an excellent 3D creating tool. Modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing, 2D animation, and of course motion tracking is all supported.

![blender video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-video-editing.jpg)

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

![kdenlive adjust slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kdenlive-adjust-slider.jpg)

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

![hitfilm express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hitfilm-express.jpg)

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award. It enables you to accurately attach images and messages and even adjust for shifting perspective. You can hide faces, license information, and any private objects using this capability.

![vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

### Adobe Premiere Pro

Because of its superior editing capabilities, Premiere Pro seems to be a requirement for anyone learning video editing. Premiere Pro, however, has a limited number of presets and automatic tools in order to provide consumers the most control.

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

When masking and blurring a face, motion tracking only works with the auto option. If not, you will need to enter and alter multiple keyframes to add text or resize the video, or you will need to install an extension to convert the mask's tracks to any transformed parts.

### PowerDirector

Due to its simplicity of use, PowerDirector is unquestionably among the greatest motion tracking programs currently available. It accomplishes complex effects without having an advanced learning curve, in contrast to other video editing tools. As demonstrated in the introductory video up top, a simple interface may be used to easily track and manage one or more motion-tracked items.

![powerdirector for mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-mac-5.jpg)

With this program, creating a simple motion track may be done in only three easy steps. This editor is for you if you want to finish the job swiftly and painlessly and are new to intermediate video editing.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.

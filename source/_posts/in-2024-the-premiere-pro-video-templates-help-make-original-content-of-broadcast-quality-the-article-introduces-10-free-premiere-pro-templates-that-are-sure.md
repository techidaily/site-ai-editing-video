### Method 2\. Customize The Change of Speed in Wondershare Filmora

You may want to set a speed that is not available on the preset list. Filmora has come up with the Uniform Speed option to let you customize the speed of the video as per your requirements. You can choose from 0.01X to 100X speed, and the chosen speed will be applied to the video uniformly. Here are the steps to follow.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file from the Project Media folder onto the timeline. Click on the Speed icon located at the top of the timeline.

Step2 From the menu, select the Uniform Speed option. You will see the Uniform Speed tab above the timeline.

![select the uniform speed option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-12.jpg)

Step3 You need to move the speed slider to set the desired speed for your video. You can play the video to see how the video speed changes.

### Method 3\. Use Speed Ramping to Customize Your Video

You can set the graph with nodes as per your requirements. According to the graph you have designed, your video speed will vary. Here is how to use speed ramping to change the speed of your video.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline and click the Speed icon.

Step2 Click Speed Ramping option from the menu. You will see Speed Ramping tab above the timeline.

![click the speed icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-14.jpg)

Step3 You can choose any preset available. If you want to customize the graph, select the Customize option and edit the nodes.

Step4 Play the video as you make the changes. Click the Ok button if the output is as per your expectation. Finally, click the Export button to save the video file.

## Conclusion

Therefore, you can get the desired video output in simpler steps.

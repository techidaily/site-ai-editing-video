## Camtasia Vs Captivate - Which to Choose?

Being a video editor, it’s critical to keep ahead of the curve in our fast-changing global world. From small enterprises to major corporations, eLearning applications have shown to be a significant tool for cutting expenses and increasing profits. Software like Camtasia and Captivate are in high demand as e-learning becomes a more vital aspect of our life. When it comes to creating a course or video instruction, these two applications are quite quick and useful. Whether you should choose a Camtasia or a Captivate relies entirely on your industry and what you want to accomplish with this application.

Often times between Camtasia vs Captivate, the question arises: "Which software is superior?" As a result, we've compared Camtasia and Captivate based on the software packages themselves, as well as some important features, similarities, and differences. Software stimulation, production, demonstration screencasts, and translation of PowerPoint presentations into various formats are all possible using TechSmith Camtasia and Adobe Captivate. Camtasia offers fewer online learning alternatives, but it boasts incredible screen and video capture, as well as video editing facilities. This application allows you to alter the sound and visual characteristics manually. Video artists may improve video quality by using auxiliary microphones and cameras. The editing of the video is Camtasia's most impressive function. It allows you to cut and paste films, add transitions and subtitles to them, as well as do color grading and color correction.

## Part 1\. Overall Comparison

Each piece of software may be used to create eLearning and lesson material. Despite the fact that Adobe Captivate offers amazing transitional features and visual effect tools, it does not include video editing, which is, in my view, the backbone of developing eLearning material that adheres to the learning management system. As a result, Adobe Captivate needs the use of Adobe Premiere to edit and correct any problems in your films. Adobe Captivate, on the other hand, is the greatest alternative for developing quality eLearning and lesson software material. It's an excellent tool for developing online courses and tutorials. However, as previously said, Adobe Captivate is not simple to use and is not recommended for novices. Camtasia, on the other hand, seems to be the most economical and practical alternative for you based on your abilities if you are an entry-level editor and want to master the fundamentals of video editing and lesson production on your own.

## Conclusion

Camtasia's technique of making a presentation using an individual movie works well for developers who are knowledgeable with video applications. Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that user’s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.

## Conclusion

Camtasia's technique of making a presentation using an individual movie works well for developers who are knowledgeable with video applications. Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that user’s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.

## Fun & Easy Masking Tricks: Wondershare Filmora Tutorial

Masking is a video effect that allows you to cut out a scene and use the overlay to duplicate, hide, modify, or reveal your video footage. Just think of it as cutting something on your video so you can see what's in the bottom layer. So, without wasting time, let me show you how to mask a video in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Let's get started!

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### _Masking Trick 1:_

First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.

![place the camera facing the door](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/place-the-camera-facing-the-door.gif)

With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let's get editing with Wondershare Filmora.

![walk backwards](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-backwards.gif)

Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.

![fire up wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-1.jpg)

Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap **Add Freeze Frame**. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

![proceed to hide the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-2.jpg)

Step 3 Next, click the **Effect** button and find the **Image Mask** effect in the **Utility** folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.

![click the effect button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-3.jpg)

Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under **Video Effects**. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the **Invert Mask** checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking **Ok**.

![double-click the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-4.jpg)

Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.

![unhide the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-5.jpg)

### _Masking Trick: 2_

In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.

![create a subject walking in and outside a tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/tree-with-clear-background.gif)

Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they'll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That's all!

![film the subject walking from one side of the tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-away-from-the-tree.gif)

Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.

![import the clip on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-6.jpg)

Step 2 Next, click **Effects**, choose **Utility**, then drag the **Image Mask** effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select **Video Effects**, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.

Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip's timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.

![adjust the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-7.jpg)

Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.

![play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-8.jpg)

### _Masking Trick 3:_

For this masking illusion, we'll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.

![create a video with a subject jumping over a house](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/set-the-camera-low.gif)

Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.

![tell your subject to walk to the marker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/jump-in-front-of-camera.gif)

Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

![import the clip into filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-9.jpg)

Step 2 Now, it's time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the **Utility** folder under **Effects** and choose **Image Mask**. Click the **Invert Mask** box to invert the mask.

![customize the clip with a mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-10.jpg)

Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under **Video Effects**. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.

![double-click the video track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-11.jpg)

Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.

![unhide the first track on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-12.jpg)

Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.

Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.

Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

Step 2 Now, it's time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the **Utility** folder under **Effects** and choose **Image Mask**. Click the **Invert Mask** box to invert the mask.

Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under **Video Effects**. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.

Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.

Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.

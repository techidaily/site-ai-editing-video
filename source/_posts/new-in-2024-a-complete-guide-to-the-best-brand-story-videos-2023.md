## A Complete Guide to the Best Brand Story Videos |2023|

With the advent of streaming content accessible anytime, anywhere, conventional marketing has somewhat lost grip on its performance. Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.

However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.

This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their **brand storytelling**. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray **your brand story** than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.

Modern-day consumers are much more educated and sophisticated than before. You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their **branding and storytelling** strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own **brand storytelling video** and are wondering how to make it a successful one.

## Part 2: Fix YouTube Zoom to Fill Not Working on Chrome

Users who are using YouTube across their browsers can also face the above-mentioned concerns. As an answer to **YouTube zoom to fill** malfunctioning across Chrome, this part comes up with a discussion of three impressive solutions that can be adopted right away for effective results.

### 1\. Clear Browser’s Cache

To start with the solutions, the first thing that you can do is to clear your Chrome’s cache. A filled cache usually hinders the flow of the application, which in turn leads to a decreased performance. To clear the browser’s cache, you need to look across the following steps:

**Step 1:** Launch your Chrome browser and click on the “Three-Dotted” icon on the top-right corner of the screen.

![click on three dots option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/youtube-zoom-fill-not-working-11.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select “Clear browsing data…” from the ‘More Tools’ option across the drop-down menu. This leads you to a new window.

![access clear browsing data option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/youtube-zoom-fill-not-working-12.jpg)

**Step 3:** Make sure you have the right time range selected for this purpose. Select the right options that will clear out the cache of your Chrome and hit “Clear Data.”

### 2\. Update Your Chrome

While seeking the right **zoom to fill YouTube** solution, you may come up with the idea of updating your Chrome browser. For this, you have to look into the steps shown below:

**Step 1:** Open Google Chrome on your desktop and click on the three-dotted icon on the top-right section. Find the option of “Help” in the drop-down menu and proceed by clicking ‘About Google Chrome’ from the next menu.

![tap on about google chrome](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/youtube-zoom-fill-not-working-14.jpg)

**Step 2:** The browser detects an update that is due for Chrome. It will automatically start updating the browser if detected. Once the update is complete, you need to restart your Chrome browser.

**Step 1:** Lead to the three-dotted icon on the top-right corner of Chrome to open the settings. Direct the cursor to “More Tools” and select “Extensions” in the protruding menu.

![access your installed extensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/youtube-zoom-fill-not-working-16.jpg)

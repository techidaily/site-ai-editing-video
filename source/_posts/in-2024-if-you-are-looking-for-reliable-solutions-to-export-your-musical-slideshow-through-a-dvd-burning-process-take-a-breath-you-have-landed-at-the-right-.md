A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13"\*9".

Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal

If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.

Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration

But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard.

## A Detailed Guid to Remove Background From a Video in Premier Pro

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the leading video editing software. You can use to create or remove a video's background. Advanced Chroma Key features such as Color Key and Ultra Key make it possible to produce background-free content quickly.

Although both Keys work similarly, many users prefer to use the Ultra key for a better result in the video. This article will explain how to remove video background in Premiere Pro if you are a newbie.

Let's get right to it and start the tutorial!

## How to Use Premiere Pro to Remove Video Background?

Adobe Premiere Pro can remove video backgrounds quickly using the **Ultra Key** feature with the following steps:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser, and download the appropriate Adobe Premiere Pro version for your [Windows PC](https://adobe-premiere.en.softonic.com/) or [Mac](https://filehippo.com/mac/download%5Fadobe-premiere-pro-cc-for-mac/). Next, install the software on your system and launch it from your Desktop or Dock.

Step2 Now, use the **Media Browser panel** in the software to browse the video clips you want to import into the software. Next, right-click on your selected video file in which you want to remove the background and choose the **"Import"** option.

Step3 Click the **"Effects"** tab in the software panel and select Video Effects. Here, you will see the **"Keying"** option; select the **Ultra Key**, press and hold it to grab the key, and place it on your video clip.

**Note:** You can also search for the Ultra Key in the Adobe Premiere Pro search bar. Drag it to the video clip containing a background you want to remove.

Step4 As soon as you drop the Ultra Key to your footage, an **Effects Control panel** will pop up. Next, use the **eyedropper tool** in the Effects Control panel. Finally, select the background color on your video that you want to remove.

![premiere pro effects control panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-effects-control-panel.png)

Step5 In the next step, click the drop-down menu next to the **"Output"** option, and select **"Alpha Channel"** from the list. This will reveal the details of your video and the edits. Also, click the "**Setting"** drop-down menu and select the Relaxed, Aggressive, or Custom option for the video effect.

Step8 In the last step, you need to save, render, and export your video with the removed background. To do this, click the **"File"** option on the Premiere Pro Media Browser, and choose **"Export"** to explore the "Media" menu.

## Tips to Make Cinematic Color Grading

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

## Part 1\. What is Cinematic Color Grading?

The cinematic look is all the rage these days and aims to mimic images captured on real film rather than digitally created. To achieve this effect, film directors use various means from lighting to cinematic color gradation. The latter is a powerful tool for bringing a cool or warm tone to a video and providing smooth color transitions to fall on an image that doesn't look too real but feels emotional.

This kind of post-production processing, which produces beautiful results when used by color magicians, requires a deep understanding of colors and their effect on our psyche and even physiology. It's not enough to watch a color grading video and use a LUT to get where you want. You should at the very least have an understanding of:

* Color wheel
* Color quality
* Color harmony and discord
* Warm and cool colors
* Color context

## Part 2\. Tips to make cinematic color grading

Here are three helpful tips to create cinematic-looking images in DaVinci Resolve.

In my 10-year career as a colorist, I've worked on every type of content imaginable: short, long, commercial, educational, episodic—you name it. And while each of these formats requires its approach, the one constant that spans them all is the client's desire for a cinematic look.

Virtually all of us aspire to more cinematic color, but we often come up short—in part because the term itself has become too broad to effectively target. To focus on the goal, I like to think of "cinematic" as "an image whose key visual properties are consistent with those of printed film."

The print film was the primary medium through which we consumed cinematic images for the first century of filmmaking and is therefore at the very heart of cinematic aesthetics. In this video, I'll show you my top three secrets to achieving this aesthetic quickly and consistently in Davinci Resolve.

### Tips1: Create Color Density

The first secret to film color is to create color density. Another key aesthetic property of film images is that colors can be either highly saturated or highly luminescent but cannot be both.

We can mimic this visual characteristic by identifying strongly saturated colors in our image and using the Hue vs. Lum to reduce their brightness. This simple technique is especially effective on pure primary colors (red, green, and blue).

![create color density](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-1.jpg)

### Tips2: Separation Beats Saturation

The second secret to film color is prioritizing separation over saturation. When you feel like an image lacks overall color or pop, it's all too easy to reach for the saturation knob, but that's not a very cinematic solution.

Instead, try using split toning—pushing cool colors into shadows and warm colors into highlights—to increase tonal separation and add depth to an image. This characteristic is present in virtually every film print and is deeply evocative when applied correctly.

### Tips3: Strong Contrast is Your Friend

The third secret of film colors is a strong contrast. This is not always easy, as a higher contrast look inherently requires more precision with exposure placement. Too often we pump up some contrast, end up with an image that looks blown out or too crisp, and then immediately back away from editing.

However, if you stick with high contrast long enough to improve your exposure, you'll get a very different result and be well on your way to a more cinematic image.

## Part 3\. How to add color cinematic grading by using Filmora?

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an option if you want to easily change the colors of your projects. You may just double-click the media after dragging it onto the editing timeline to change the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue.

##### Step1Add the media

![add the media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

##### Step2Correct the color \[Basic and Advanced\]

In the timeline, double-click the video editing window. Select the **"Color"** panel and make adjustments.

![color panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

* Contrast: By adjusting this setting, you can control the brightness and color in different parts of the image.
* Saturation: This setting highlights the gray part of the video to a shade. You can adjust it to make the colors of the entire video image appear more saturated or more subdued.
* Brightness: You can change this setting to adjust the overall darkness and lightness of your project.
* Hue: Hue is generally the lightness of a color. Let's say that when red is saturated with white, it creates a shade of pink.
* 3D LUT: 3D lookup tables provide your media with Hollywood movie color sets like the 007 series, Batman, Harry Porter, etc.

Hover over the indicator to adjust the color correction settings. Then left click on it and move the slider. The corresponding value stabilizes after releasing the mouse button.

##### Step3Preview and save the new video

Filmora's color correction tools will make your videos look natural, more attractive, more vibrant, consistent, and professional.

**Color Correction Presets**

[Color correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) presets help your video achieve an enhanced **cinematic look**. Adjust gives you control over fine-tuning the colors in your shots. You can make various adjustments such as color temperature and exposure.

In the **“Effects > LUT”** tab, you'll see an extensive selection of preset color settings. These include Vignettes, Movie Looks Like Old Movies, and Cinematic 3D LUT effects such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, and Mission Impossible.

![effects lut tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

Color is abundant in our life. Our moods, sensations, and perceptions, as well as our decision-making processes, are all influenced by color. Emotion evokes by color. It affects our perception, eliciting subconscious or conscious responses in the human brain. Color is perhaps the most robust tool at your disposal as a designer because of its influential and communicative nature.

![color combinations for designers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-01.JPG)

Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best **color that matches together** to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we've got you backed up. The ten best **colors that match everything** are listed below to help you create your next design.

#### In this article

01 [What is a color combination?](#Part 1)

02 [Types of color combinations](#Part 2)

03 [Two-color combination vs. Three-color logo combinations](#Part 3)

04 [How to apply color combinations to your designs?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

**●** 10 Matching Color Combination That Works Together

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

Color is abundant in our life. Our moods, sensations, and perceptions, as well as our decision-making processes, are all influenced by color. Emotion evokes by color.

![color combinations for designers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-01.JPG)

Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best **color that matches together** to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we've got you backed up. The ten best **colors that match everything** are listed below to help you create your next design.

#### In this article

02 [Types of color combinations](#Part 2)

03 [Two-color combination vs. Three-color logo combinations](#Part 3)

04 [How to apply color combinations to your designs?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

**●** 10 Matching Color Combination That Works Together

![set the phone on a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-3.jpg)

## Part 3: Start Filming

Step1 Firstly, you must show the coin and the bottom of the glass.

![show the coin and the bottom of the glass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-4.png)

Step2 After that, you need to hold the coin with the fingers part of one hand and tap down on the coin. Make sure it looks like the coin is going through straight to the glass.

![hold the coin with the fingers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-5.jpg)

Step3 You need someone else to drop the other coin from the top. Meanwhile, you are pretending to tap a coin on the glass. You don't need to worry about someone else hand in the frame. Since you can remove it easily with the masking feature in Filmora.

![drop the other coin from the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-6.jpg)

CapCut and Wondershare Filmora both possess AI powers to ensure seamless video creation. However, Filmora offers more video editing features, and all of them offer customization. The interface is just perfect for every professional or non-professional. With its accessible interface, you must try the following video editing tools:

#### 1\. [Screen Recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For the seamless generation of tutorials and ‘How to” videos, this editor offers a screen recorder. The recorder is embedded with custom settings to cater to each user’s requirements. You can accommodate screen resolution, microphone settings, and cam settings with it.

#### 2\. [Keyframing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Transform your illustrations into reality using Filmora's keyframe editing feature. You can add keyframes at different points in the timeline to adjust the movements. There are custom settings like position, scale, opacity, color, and more for each keyframe.

#### 3\. [Split Screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Make your videos happening and captivating simultaneously with Filmora's split screen option. This allows you to add distinct videos and auto-adjust them at different split screens. You can also enable manual visual, audio, and AI editing for each split video.

#### 4\. [Assets Backup & Sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Why worry about finishing a project at once when you can edit it later with Filmora? With its cloud backup option, you can start editing a video where you left off. In addition, the tool also offers synchronization across devices. This means you can access your videos, downloaded assets, and other storage data with a simple login.

#### 5\. [AI Text-Based Editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

As discussed earlier, the AI algorithms allow you to edit with full efficiency. This feature of Filmora enhances productivity via text-to-speech function. It creates captions out of a video and allows you to seamlessly cut videos by removing text.

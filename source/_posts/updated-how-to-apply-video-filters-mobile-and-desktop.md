## Does Windows 10 have built-in video editing software?

The answer is yes. Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn't work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.

You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You'll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.

Some people say that windows video editor has a very simple interface and it only has very basic features. In this case, having something is more important than not having anything at all. Also, you should keep in mind that not everyone needs a fully-fledged [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Some people have to do just basic tasks like trimming a video and increasing the brightness of a video. It is not feasible for them to purchase expensive video editing software for that purpose. So the Windows 10 video editor is the best in this case.

## How To Brighten A Video In Windows 10 Easily

This article will discuss two different methods using which you can easily brighten your videos in Windows 10\. So, without wasting any more time, let's get started.

### 1\. Using Filmora to brighten a video in Windows 10

You may think that all video editing software is created equal, but that's where you're wrong. The best video editor for your needs is drastically different depending on what you want to do with the end product. Some people want a quick way to make a trailer or showcase their products, and others want to put together an amateur movie.

Filmora is one of the best video editing software for Windows that can improve or fix your dark videos. Filmora is an all-in-one video editor for Windows and Mac. With Filmora, you can easily edit videos and make simple videos with transitions and effects, and you can give any video a professional touch.

If you've ever had a video that looked too dark to use, there are ways to fix it aside from taking an entirely new video.

If you’ve ever had a video that looked too dark to use, then you can easily brighten it up using Filmora. Just follow the steps given below:

### Step 1

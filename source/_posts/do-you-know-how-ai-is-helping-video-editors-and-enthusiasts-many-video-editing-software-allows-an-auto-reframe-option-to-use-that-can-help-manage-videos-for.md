## YouTube Algorithm Hacks 2024

Every day, more than 1 billion hours of YouTube videos are seen by users worldwide, including cat videos and videos for cats. The YouTube algorithm determines the videos YouTube recommends to its more than 2 billion human users (and untold numbers of feline users).

The subject of how to encourage YouTube's algorithm to promote your videos and give you more likes is crucial for marketers, influencers, and creators alike.

We'll discuss what the algorithm is (and isn't), the most recent updates for 2022, and how experts use

YouTube's search and discovery tools to push their videos in front of viewers in this blog post.

Let’s start!

## Part 1\. YouTube’s algorithm’s history

The YouTube algorithm: What is it? Let's take a quick look at how YouTube's algorithm has evolved through time and how it functions now in order to respond to your question.

**2005 to 2011: Click-and-view optimization**

In order to crowdsource footage of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake's infamous Superbowl performance, according to YouTube founder Jawed Karim (a.k.a. the star of Me at the Zoo), YouTube was established in 2005\. Therefore, it should not be surprising that YouTube's algorithm for many years displayed suggested videos that had the most views or clicks. Unfortunately, this resulted in an increase in deceptive titles and thumbnails, or clickbait. User experience suffered as a result of videos that made viewers feel duped, dissatisfied, or just plain irritated.

**2012: Watch time optimization**

YouTube made changes to its recommendation engine in 2012 to account for the amount of time spent watching each video as well as the total amount of time spent on the site. According to theory, when people find videos important and engaging, they watch them for a longer period of time, possibly all the way through. Due to this, some creators tried to make their movies shorter to enhance the likelihood that viewers would watch them through, while others made their videos longer to boost overall viewing time. YouTube maintained the official line—create content your audience wants to watch, and the algorithm will reward you—while refusing to support either of these strategies. However, as anyone who has used the internet for any length of time can attest, not all time spent online is created equal. YouTube has adopted a new strategy.

**2015–2016: maximizing fulfillment**

In addition to emphasizing direct reaction metrics like Shares, Likes, and Dislikes (and, of course, the extremely cruel "not interested" button), YouTube started monitoring viewer happiness directly using user surveys in 2005\. YouTube published a whitepaper titled Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations in 2016 that detailed some of the inner workings of its AI.

**2016-present: demonetization, and brand safety**

The size and popularity of YouTube have led to an increase in content moderation difficulties over time, and what the algorithm suggests is now a major topic for news outlets and the government in addition to creators and advertisers.

YouTube has stated that it takes seriously its obligation to promote a variety of viewpoints while limiting the spread of damaging false material. For instance, algorithm modifications implemented in the beginning of 2019 have reduced consumption of questionable content by 70%. (According to YouTube, borderline content is that which is harmful or misleading but doesn't quite go against community standards. On the other hand, offensive material is taken down right away.)

Creators are impacted by this problem because they worry about unintentionally breaking the constantly evolving community rules and getting punished with strikes, demonetization, or worse. (In fact, enhancing openness for community norms for artists is one of YouTube's priorities for 2021, according to CEO Susan Wojcicki.) Brands and advertisers are also impacted since they don't want their name and logo to be associated with white nationalists.

Politicians in America are growing more concerned about the societal impact of social media algorithms like YouTube's. Democrats introduced the "Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act" in early 2021, and YouTube (and other platforms) have been called to testify before Senate committees about their algorithms. Let's now discuss what is known about this hazardous beast's mechanism.

## Part 2\. How will YouTube's algorithm function in 2022?

The YouTube algorithm chooses videos for users with the intention of finding the most relevant content for them and keeping them interested. When we refer to "the algorithm," we mean one of three selection or discovery techniques that are related but slightly different: three different algorithms: one that chooses videos for YouTube's main page, one that ranks the results of any given search, and one that chooses what videos users should watch next are used.

According to YouTube, in 2022 the majority of channels' top traffic sources would often be their homepage and suggested videos. With the exception of explainer or instructional films, which frequently receive the most traffic via search (e.g., "how to tune up a bicycle")

## Part 3\. How is the algorithm set up on YouTube?

What ranking factors does YouTube consider when deciding which videos to display to users? Every traffic source varies a little. But in the end, a combination of factors including customization (the history and preferences of the viewer) performance (the success of the video) external variables (the overall audience or market)

## Part 4\. How YouTube determines its homepage algorithm

The YouTube algorithm presents a wide selection of videos that it thinks a user might like to view every time they open the YouTube app or type in youtube.com. Because the computer hasn't yet determined what the viewer wants—acoustic versions of popular songs, for example—this selection is frequently broad. talks that are motivating against procrastination? to watch their preferred possum vlogger? Two categories of ranking signals are used to determine which videos appear on the homepage:

**Performance:**

YouTube gauges performance using indicators including the click-through rate, typical viewing time, typical percentage of views, likes, and disapproval ratings from viewers. After you upload a video, the algorithm initially displays it to a small number of users on their homepage. If it appeals to, engages, and satisfies those viewers (i.e., they click on it, watch it through, like it, share it, etc.), then it is then presented to an increasing number of users on their homepages.

**Personalization:**

However, the trending tab does not include YouTube. According to their past activity, also known as their watch history, or personalization, YouTube suggests videos to users based on what it believes are relevant to their interests. More of the same will be presented to a user if they frequently watch a particular channel or show they have an interest in. This element is also responsive to behavioral alterations throughout time as a person's affinities and interests change.

## Conclusion

It's a fallacy that the algorithm would penalize you for publishing too regularly or insufficiently frequently, even if YouTube undoubtedly promotes the idea of uploading constantly in order to develop and maintain a relationship with your audience. The growth of the audience is unrelated to the interval between uploads. The zeitgeist can change quickly, but by keeping an eye on Google Trends and giving yourself opportunity to explore, you won't fall behind.

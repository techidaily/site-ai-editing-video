**Second method: detection of the scene**

If there are different shots in your clips or separation in the scenes, you can use the tool of "scene detection" in the Wondershare Filmora.

**Step 1\.** Select your video clip from the media library that you want to split. After right-clicking on it, select the option of "Scene detection" from the menu.

![split a clip in lightworks ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/split-a-clip-in-lightworks-11.jpeg)

**Step 2\.** The new window of the scene detection appears and then click on "Detect". Depending on the transitions of the video clips, it is divided into different parts.

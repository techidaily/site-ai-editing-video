## Bonus! Tips on Editing Videos in Powerpoint

Now that you know how to trim video PowerPoint, here are some helpful tips on editing videos on this application.

#### How to Crop Videos in PowerPoint

Once you have inserted your video in the slide, you have the option of cropping it. Follow these steps below to learn how to crop video PowerPoint.

1. Open your presentation and then go to the slide where you have inserted your video clip.
2. Double-click or select the video, and the two Video Tools tabs will appear in the ribbon: Playback and Format. Hit the Format tab option to activate it.

1. Your slide may show a black rectangle after you insert your video.
2. Add a Poster Frame to the video clip to get rid of the black rectangle.
3. Click Crop in the Video Tools Format tab.

1. On the edges of your video clip, you'll see dark crop handles. If you use the Video Shape option, the crop handles will appear on the edge of that shape.
2. Pressing the Ctrl key on your keyboard while you drag allows you to alter how you crop. Pressing Ctrl plus dragging the side cropping handles resizes two opposite sides, while Ctrl plus dragging the corner cropping handles resizes all the four sides.
3. Pressing the Shift key on your keyboard while dragging will give you different results. You can also use the Shift and Ctrl keys simultaneously to combine both capabilities.
4. You can reposition the crop by either moving the video itself or the crop area.
5. Crop the unwanted portion by hitting the Crop button again or pressing the Enter key. You can also click on the Slide Area to apply the cropping changes.
6. You can access more crop options by right-clicking the video, where a contextual menu will appear. Select the Format Video option.
7. You'll see the Format Video Task Pane; select the Crop option.

1. You can crop sections of the video by specifying the Picture or Crop Position. You can also change other crop parameters, such as Top, Left, Offset Y, Offset X, Height, and Width.

#### How to Play Video Inside a Shape

If you want to edit your video and enhance its appearance, you can have it play inside a unique shape instead of the usual rectangle format that videos play in. In turn, you'll draw attention to your video.

To play your video in an unusual shape, select your video and navigate to the Format tab. Then, go to the Video Shape menu, where you'll see multiple shapes to choose from.

#### How to Apply Preset Video Styles

You can also liven up your video by applying one of the pre-designed styles that PowerPoints provides. These styles combine various effects, including bevels, reflections, shadows, tilts, and frames.

Applying preset video styles is a simple process. Select the video, then navigate to the Format tab. Click More under the Video Style section. You'll see a gallery of preset styles; roll your mouse over it and hold the cursor over any style type. The program will apply a live preview of this style to your video.

## Conclusion

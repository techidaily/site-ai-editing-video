## Interested in Adding a Cinematic Strobe Light Effect to Your Movie or Video Title? Follow the Steps Explained in Detail Here

In video editing, professionals put in different types of effects to create a unique feel to the visuals. In fact, there are different styles available that you can use in videos to create a specific feel in the viewers—case in point, strobe lights.

This technique involves a series of intense short flashes of light in sections of the clip that create a suspenseful or thrilling ambiance, amping up the horror feel in viewers and more. You might have seen many examples of this in horror movies, thrillers, suspense or action-filled movies, sci-fi films, etc. Similarly, adding the effect to the titles gives a cinematic feel to them.

As a film or video editor, are you interested in adding this effect to your own project as well? Luckily, you do not need significant technical know-how or invest in different types of high-grade equipment to manage it - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows users to add the effect easily in the titles. Want to know how? Read ahead.

## Launch the software first

Of course, before you can begin adding the effect to your video, you must have the software. The downloading process for Wondershare Filmora 11 is very straightforward as long as you have a Mac or Windows PC.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

First, visit the official website to download the software. The Download button at the top of the screen or the description box is available to click on. That will instantly allow the Filmora installer to download into your device.

![tap the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-1.jpg)

Double-click on the installer from your notifications or browser downloads section, then click Install. Allow the prompt for permission approval when it comes up, and the installation process will begin. This would take a little bit of time, and you can tap on the Start Now button at the last window that opens.

![click install](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-2.jpg)

## Add the title

The editor will open automatically next. You have to tap on the Create New Project button to access the editing screen, tap on the Titles tab, and choose the Default Title. If you prefer another version, browse through the different title presets available as options and download the one you prefer.

![drag and drop default title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-3.jpg)

Then, drag the title from this section and drop it into the editing timeline. Double-click on the title in the timeline to open the title editing window. Insert the text you want to add as the title in the text field and adjust the size, font, and other font modifications here.

## Edit the title and click snapshots

Then, you should drag the title clip you added to the timeline to an upper section and click on the Media tab following that. Then, choose the Sample Color option from the listed menu and tap on the Black color choice. After doing so, drag it down to the timeline onto the track under the Default Title clip you added and moved up.

Consequently, click on the Snapshot icon at the right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will take a screenshot of the black color picture you added second.

![add second color image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-4.jpg)

Then you should double-click on the original Default Title you added and start editing your title text once more. This time, add the term you want to appear under your original title here. Adjust the font for it as something other than the original one. For example, if you put Motor Oil 1937 M54 as the first title font, set the second as Montserrat SemBold. Make more adjustments, if necessary, to the font. Then, retake a snapshot of it.

![change the second title text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-5.jpg)

## Insert the snapshots

Remove the two title clips you added to the timeline. You have to work with the Snapshots you took now.

It is possible that you will not see the Snapshots saved in your media folder. In this case, tap on the "Click here to insert media" section and go to the device library. It will open in the Wondershare Filmora folder; if not, search for it and access it.

In the folder, double-click on the Snapshot folder. Choose both of the Snapshots you saved right now from here and tap on Open to import them into Filmora.

![choose and import both snapshots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-6.jpg)

## Import additional music and background visuals

After you have imported the snapshots to Filmora, you have to tap on the Import File option again. Go to the folder where you saved specific files like Lens flare, background video, particles, and sound effect clips. If you have these previously saved in other folders, make sure to keep them all in one folder ahead of time and open that one here.

Choose all files and click on Open to add them to the Filmora software. Now starts the process of merging them all into one cohesive effect.

![open all of the files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-7.jpg)

## Drag the files into the timeline

The background video is the first file you will drag and drop to the timeline. For the best effect, choose a flashing light background video. Next, drag the first title you edited into Track 2, right above the first one. Make sure to adjust the length of the clip to match the background video length. Repeat the same for the second snapshot, adding it above the first snapshot in the timeline.

![drag and drop the background video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-8.jpg)

## Edit the snapshots via Chroma Key and Composting

You must hide the second snapshot you added, i.e., the one in the 3rd Track on the timeline. After that, click on snapshot 1 and tap on the Chroma Key icon in the toolbar right above the timeline.

When the Chroma Key window opens, tap on the Select Color option and go to the “More…” option. Tap on the basic white color and click on OK.

Following it, move the slider for Edge Thickness to extend it and see the preview to know if you are satisfied with the amount. Then, click on the unhide icon for the second snapshot. Right-click on it and tap on the Composting option. Under the Blending Mode parameter, change the option to Screen. The title background will remove automatically.

Press OK.

![tap on the compositing option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-9.jpg)

## Add the sound effect

Again, you must hide the second snapshot in the timeline with the same step as before. Then, drag the sound effect to the audio track timeline next. Tap on the Play button under the Preview to see how the effect looks with the sound. Cut out the extra second of the sound effect clip to align it with the ending section of all of the other clips.

## Add the initial keyframes

Choose the first snapshot in the timeline, below the second snapshot, and above the background video clip. Then, double-click on it to open the editor window and choose the Animation tab this time instead of Image.

Add the keyframe here and change the value of the Scale parameter to 400 or something high like that. In the preview, you will see that most of the font in this title is out of frame. After this, click on Rotate and turn the font to 45 degrees.

![click on rotate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-10.jpg)

Move your playhead on this snapshot clip in the timeline by at least 1 second. Then, add another keyframe in this location by tapping the Add button. Here, reset the Scale and Rotate parameters and press the OK button to end.

## Add the lens flare and particle video

Next, go back to the media section where all the files you added are present and drag your lens flare clip to the timeline, right on the track above the last one you added. Drop it here and adjust the length of it to match others if it does not show that automatically.

Above it, drag and drop the Particles video from the media files you added previously onto the track above the lens flare one. Do the same to delete the spare part by moving the play head to that point, clicking on the scissor icon, and removing the extra part.

Then, double-click on this Particles video clip on the timeline and go to the Compositing section. Tap on the Blending Mode drop-down choice and choose the Screen option. Press OK. Next, repeat the same for the lens flare video and tap the OK button.

Now, play the preview again.

![drag and drop particles video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-11.jpg)

## Adjust the second title, again

Remember how you clicked on the hide button for the second snapshot for title 2? Now, you have to click on the unhide icon beside it.

Move the play head to the 3-second mark from the beginning. If you need clarification on this, check if the lens flare effect is beginning to start below the first title at this point. Move your playhead to that point for the second snapshot.

Here, tap on the Split icon and remove the clip's first half. Then, double-click on the second half and go to Animation. Press the Add button to insert a keyframe here and change the scale and position of the title at this point. Move it to the placement you want, right above the lens flare. Also, drag the slider for the Opacity parameter to zero at this point.

![drag the slider for opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-12.jpg)

Subsequently, move the play head to the point when the lens flare effect stop, which is around 2 seconds more. At this point, you have to add another keyframe and change the Opacity to 100.

Play the preview of the whole thing to see how the effect looks in completion.

## What Is the Best FPS for YouTube Videos?

YouTube has become one of the to go to social media platforms for internet use because it provides entertainment for people who want to get entertained, learn or catch up with their favorite personalities. This platform has also given content creators a space to showcase their talents, educate the masses or simply have a good time when playing their games.

However, being a content creator on YouTube entails more than just posting a video weekly. You ought to ensure you get the frame rate in the video right. Failure to choose the correct frame rate will affect how your audience enjoys the video, increasing the chances that you lose subscribers.

Without further ado, let's discuss the best fps for YouTube.

![best fps for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-fps.JPG)

## How Does FPS Affect Viewing YouTube Videos?

Before we dive into how FPS affects your viewing experience on YouTube and determine the best frame rate for YouTube, let's define what it is. FPS is short for frames per second and is the number of still images appearing on display in one second. The more frames per second you have in your video, the clearer your video will become. The vice versa is also true.

To further simplify this definition, we will use the example of a flipbook. An animator usually draws an image on each page of the book. When they flip the pages in rapid succession, the images appear to be in motion. Suppose the animator used fewer pages to make their flipbook.

![flipbook animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flipbook.gif)

The animation would not be as smooth and crisp as if they had used more pages, each with a different still image contributing to the final motion.

The human brain can easily differentiate between 12 distinct images. However, when the photos exceed 18 and move rapidly, the brain is tricked into believing that the pictures are in motion. A frame rate lower than 24FPS will make your YouTube video look choppy and unnatural, as if it lags in real time.

Ideally, 24fps is the best fps for YouTube videos featuring mundane activities that we see in daily life. However, if you want to pack more information into your video and make the motion a bit smoother, then 30fps is the best video frame rate for YouTube.

Perhaps you post fast-paced content about gaming and other live-action videos. You are better off choosing 60FPS, which makes high-speed scenes look more fluid and helps you capture double the information.

## What Is the Recommended & Highest Frame Rate for YouTube Videos?

Unfortunately, there is no correct answer when it comes to the best video frame rate for YouTube videos. The controversy still continues, and everyone seems to have their own opinion.

According to [Thomas Edison](https://techland.time.com/2012/12/06/riddles-in-the-dark-the-hobbits-48-frames-per-second-explained/), anything less than 46FPS for motion pictures will strain the eyes and give an unpleasant viewing experience. At the time, filmmakers and videographers were adamant about sticking to between 22-26PFS for their videos, provided the audio adaptability remained at 35mm.

Different frame rates are used for various displays, genres, and mediums. For instance, 1-16FPS was common in silent-era movies and stop-motion movies. However, this frame rate is neither universally accepted nor widespread in the world today.

![recommended frame rate for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recommended-youtube-video-frame-rate.JPG)

An excellent example of a frame rate that produces larger-than-life videos with exceptional detail is 24fps. However, the NTSC confirms that it is, in fact, 23.97 frames per second when you consider issues to do with color and hue.

Another universally acceptable frame rate is 30fps, which is widespread in television. Videographers also use it to make slow-motion segments in sports videos or other fast-paced content. The sweet 60fps makes any motion look smooth as butter and significantly reduces any blur in your videos. This frame rate is also characterized by super fine details you can easily miss with 24 and 30fps. It is also the highest fps video on YouTube.

120fps is synonymous with grandeur, with its monumental footage suitable for slow-motion scenes. Lastly, anything above 120fps works great with ultra-slow-motion videos. Of course, we are talking 240fps, which is rare but not uncommon. However, you would need a high-speed capture camera, which we believe doesn't come cheap.

To sum it all up, 24fps is the recommended frame rate for YouTube. You can go higher than the baseline and use 30fps or higher if you make videos with lots of motion, like gaming videos. Most of the time, a higher frame rate is a personal choice rather than a necessity. However, we understand you want to give your viewers a pleasant experience while watching your content.

## What Is the Best Frame Rate for YouTube Videos?

If you want to record a video for your YouTube channel, you might wonder what is the best fps for YouTube videos. You are better off sticking between 24fps and 60fps. The platform has only recently added 8K support for videos, which is a plus for many content creators. Below is a list of frame rates for the most popular genres on YouTube.

![frame rate for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-frame-rate.jpg)

* Podcasts and talk shows - 30 FPS
* Gaming videos - 60 FPS
* Makeup tutorials - 60 FPS
* Educational videos - 24- 30 FPS
* Health and fitness - 24-30 FPS
* Sports - 40-60 FPS

Remember that the list above is not exhaustive and doesn't cover all types of content on the platform. We can't also guarantee that there is a "best" frame rate for your YouTube video. We suggest you heed our suggestion and practice to determine the best frame rate for YouTube videos.

We couldn't fail to mention that your frame rate should match the content uploading and decoding. Since the interlaced content may experience performance issues on YouTube, it would help if you deinterlaced it.

## How To Check FPS on YouTube Video?

Below is a simple guide on how to check fps on YouTube videos.

Step1 Open any video on YouTube and right-click on it. A pop-up window will appear. Select "Stats for nerds."

Step2 Narrow down on the "Current/Optimal Res" tab. The first set of figures before the forward slash represents the current resolution, while the figures after the forward slash represent the optimal resolution for the video. For instance, the figure in the picture below indicates that the resolution is 1280\*720, and the frame rate is 30FPS. The figures repeat themselves, meaning that the video is at the optimal resolution.

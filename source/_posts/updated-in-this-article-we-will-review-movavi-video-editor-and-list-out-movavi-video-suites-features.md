### **Interface**

The Movavi Video Editor Plus 2022 is one of Movavi's aesthetically pleasing apps. When selecting different tabs on the upper part of the interface, toolbars and tabs can be found at the top or on the left, and the tools will expand. Right on the right is a player that lets you preview samples of videos, transitions, titles, and so on. Even dozens of tracks can be added and edited at once to create your video, as you can add video, audio, and images to the timeline at the bottom.

### **Quick Video Creation**

This is one of the best features of this video editor. Adding a video, selecting a template, then adding loyalty-free audios will quickly create a video with the help of the video creation wizard.

### **Editing Tools**

You can edit your videos with all the editing tools necessary to make them more personal, such as Rotate, Crop, Trim, Split, Stabilize, Adjust colors, Combine, Stabilize, Pan and Zoom, Slow motion, Chroma key, Scene detection, Animate, Highlight & Concealed, Add logo, Overlay, etc. Applying an editing tool is as simple as selecting a video, choosing a tool, and configuring the settings.

### **Creativity: Filters, Transitions, Titles and Stickers**

To make your video more personal, you will need to add filters, titles, transitions, and stickers. Movavi video editor offers free templates built-in and templates that can be purchased from its store.

And you are lucky since this section will cover this necessary topic.

Of course, we have to thank content writer Ubaid Ullah for the article on how to get Discord GIF profile without nitro. After all, it is one of our reference points.

**Step 1:** Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don't have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.

**Step 2:** Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don't worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.

**Step 3:** Let's use the ezgif website. Upon accessing it, ensure that you settle for the APNG maker icon. It is on the top left of the website.

**Step 6:** You can add multiple after-effects after creating the GIF to customize the final look

**Step 7:** Download the final file and save it on your PC with the name you wish

**Upload your files**

Upload your photos and arrange them in the order you want. In most of the slideshow makers, you will get the option of sliding pictures and rearranging them. You can also insert text on pictures after this step.

**Apply effects, filters and transitions**

Your basic slideshow is ready. Now apply effects, filters and transitions to make your slideshow beautiful. The theme itself comes with the effects sometimes; for example; if you choose holiday theme, romance or party, the theme will come with effects and filters accordingly. But you can customize it as per your choice and apply filters and effects according to your preference. Then check transition library and apply the one that attract you.

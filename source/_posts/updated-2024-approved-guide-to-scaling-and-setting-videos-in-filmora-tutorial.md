![import media files in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-9.jpg)

Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let's look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.

**Step 2: Trim to shorten the video**

Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!

![trim the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-10.jpg)

To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.

**Step 3: Export as GIF**

Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.

![export mov to gif in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-11.jpg)

When it's done, click "Open Folder", and you'll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.

A perfect example is writing a chat about something very empowering. When you choose to correspond this type of content through text, it could take a little more effort and a bit of intricately used language to build up the reader and get the desired effect of empowering the reader. Emojis are very accurate in passing out the meaning and are shorter than words. That is the primary reason why all-in-all emojis can save effort and time to create your Discord chat.

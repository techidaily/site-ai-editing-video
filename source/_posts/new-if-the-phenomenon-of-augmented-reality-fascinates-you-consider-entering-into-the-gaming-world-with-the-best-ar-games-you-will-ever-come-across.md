![access effects control](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-10.jpg)

### Step 3: Changing the Distortion Control

Scroll down to find "Distortion" in the controls and expand it. The user is suggested to increase the color distortion to give an RGB effect to the footage. After that, you should reduce the distortion rate to 0 so that different artifacts can be eliminated effortlessly.

![customize distortion settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-11.jpg)

### Step 4: Changing the Noise Strength

![increase noise strength](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-12.jpg)

### Step 5: Animating the Glitch Effect

To animate the glitch, use the playhead on the top and drag it to the first position where the effect should start from. Hit the stopwatch located on the left of "Master Amplitude." It will create a keyframe. Alter the "Master Amplitude" to 0 as we do not want the clip to begin with a glitch.

![animate the glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-13.jpg)

### Step 6: Playing with the Playhead

Now, use your keyboard's right arrow to move the playhead three frames forward. After that, set the "Master Amplitude" to 100\. Again, move the playhead three frames forward and set the "Master Amplitude" to 0\. The animation is produced on the RGB color distortion.

![customize master amplitude settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-14.jpg)

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage.

Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.

![top video editor with useful masking - Final Cut Pro X](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-4.jpg)

#### How to Create a Mask in Final Cut Pro X

With little effort, the Shape Mask tool allows you to make a mask in any shape on the continuum, ranging from an ellipse to a rectangle.

The Shape Mask is a simple mask that may be changed to editable control points in order to create complex bespoke masks (converting it into a Draw Mask).

* Open the Final Cut Pro project and select the clip you wish to mask.  
Note: You can't composite a clip over another one while using isolated clips. Final Cut Pro has this option, which you may find in the Comping window.
* To make a clip transparent, select it in the timeline and place the play head at a point within the video clip that shows the portion you wish to make transparent.
* Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline (or press Command-5) to display the Effects browser.
* Select the Shape Mask effect in the Effects Browser.

Tip: Type "shape" in the Effects browser search bar to quickly locate the Shape Mask effect.

To apply the masking effect to the clip in the timeline, choose one of the following options:

1. Drag the effect to the timeline clip.
2. Double-click the effect thumbnail in the Effects browser to apply it.
3. Use the on-screen controls to modify the shape mask if necessary.

The controls for the Shape Mask appear in the viewer, overlaid on top of the video image. In addition, the Effects area of the Video inspector displays the Shape Mask options. By default, the Shape Mask is set to a partially feathered ellipse shape in the center of the frame.

### 3\. Wondershare Filmora

Filmora 11 is an easy to use video editor with useful masking features. It provides various of masking presets to make masking easy for you. If you are looking for Green Screen, Filmora also covers you. Its Chroma Key allows you to remove the background of almost any color.

#### Masking in Filmora 11

Filmora 11 has been modified to allow for the masking of keyframes. First, double-click the clip on your timeline to open a settings window in the library. Then, in the videos area, select the "Mask" option. Multiple forms may be selected here.

We picked the ‘Star' form for this project. After selecting it, you may drag the shape to your clip in the preview area.

Scrolling down in the Windows category will take you to more options where you can change the scale, position, width, height, and radius of your chosen shape. You may also lessen the strength of the form and rotate it to make it blend in better with the other elements you're trying to hide in your window.

To add the keyframe, simply hit the "Add" button after completing it. You may then modify the mask's form to match the added frame.

### 4\. Avid Media Composer

Avid Media Composer has a comprehensive masking feature for video editors of different levels. You can either use the built-in masking tools or make your own one.

![top video editor with useful masking - avid](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-6.jpg)

#### Masking in Avid Media Composer

This will open up the Draw Mask window, where you can draw your mask using the various tools provided. To apply the mask, simply click the "Apply" button.

If you want to use an existing mask, select the "Use Mask" option and then choose the mask you want to use from the drop-down menu.

### 5\. Sony Vegas Pro

Sony Vegas Pro is a professional video editing software with robust masking tools. The interface of the editor may looks complicated for beginners, yet once you get familiar with it, you will be amazed by what you can achieve with the Vegas Pro.

![top video editor with useful masking - sony vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-7.jpg)

#### Masking in Sony Vegas Pro

Step 1: Drag the clip from the Explorer or Project Media windows and drop it on the timeline. Then, look for another video that is quite distinct from the first.

Step 2: Drag it to the timeline below the first video event. A new track will be created. Place the original event directly beneath the video occurrence.

The Video Preview window does not display the second video because it is covered by the first video, which resembles one photo sitting on top of another in a stack. So to view the lower clip, we'll need to add a mask.

### 6\. Magix Movie Edit Pro

Magix Movie Edit Pro is another video editor that is great for adding masks to your video. It is famous for its ease-of-learn and stable rendering. When it comes to masking, it is also quite powerful.

Then you must duplicate the video section and place it on a lower track, while keeping the alpha mask picture in between the two videos (click the graphic above for a visual guide).

### 7\.  Studio

![top video editor with useful masking - <!-- Pinnacle --> Studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-9.jpg)

#### Masking in  Studio

Select the clip you want to overlay your media on, then click the ‘Mask' button on the editing toolbar. After that, open the mask creation window by clicking ‘Create Mask.

First, click "Create Panel" to create a video mask panel.

To make a panel, use the panel of tools on the left side of the preview window. They'll only be shown in your video when you add assets later if they're inside this panel. Keep in mind that you may modify the size and placement of your asset within the panel and the panel itself; therefore, you might need to.

To access the media selection possibilities, click on the ‘Asset' tab of the mask creation window. To discover the picture or video you want to include in your panel, go through your imported files by selecting ‘Select media.' After that, select the media to be included in your panel video mask and hit ‘Apply.'

Use the left-hand slider or the resizing box in the preview window on the right to change the size and placement of your media in your panel video mask.

To adjust the 3D position of your panel video mask, go to the ‘3D' tab of the mask creation window.

### 8\. CyberLink PowerDirector

Then, go to the Quick Settings menu (press the Menu button at the bottom of your screen), select Cloud Print from the drop-down menu, and then select your photo. Then open up the design interface by selecting Mask Designer from the drop-down menu.

You may select from a variety of templates in the Mask Designer. If you want to make your own mask shape, the Mask Designer has three alternatives for you to create new mask types.

Create an image mask: You may use any picture or video, and it will be resized to fit the shape.

Create a text mask: Enter the text you'd like to appear in your photo. Then, go to the left side of the panel under Font/Paragraph on the left side for font style, size, and other options. To alter the text mask itself, go to the preview window and resize it on the left panel.

## Conclusion

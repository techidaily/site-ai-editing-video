## Hot FAQs on Converting Videos for WhatsApp

### 1\. How can I send a 10-minute video on WhatsApp?

Users can directly send videos with 10-minute-length via WhatsApp if the file size is 16 MB or lower. Otherwise, you can compress the file using a **video converter for WhatsApp.** Alternatively, you can upload your file into your Cloud account and copy the link to send.

### 2\. How to convert YouTube videos to WhatsApp?

You can directly copy the YouTube-based video link below the Share button on its page, paste it into the chat, and send it. Alternatively, you can use a reliable converter tool to download YouTube videos in one of the supported video formats (e.g., MP4). Then, share them via WhatsApp chat.

### 3\. How to Send Videos on WhatsApp Without Compressing?

WhatsApp compresses the video files automatically when users insert and send them via the Gallery icon within chats. However, you can avoid reducing video quality or compressing them if you send it by clicking on the Document icon > My Media Files/whichever folder the file is in.

## Which Video Formats Does WhatsApp Support?

“WhatsApp only allows me to send (a) video of maximum (of) 17 MB size, of duration 2:50 minutes. But my cousin has sent me a video of 35 MB, with (a) 5:40 minutes duration. How has this been possible?”

Indeed, WhatsApp has size and format-related restrictions, like a 16 MB size limit. However, you can access the WhatsApp Web version to share longer videos since it allows a size limit of 64 MB. Alternatively, you can **reduce video size for WhatsApp** with converter tools to compress, convert, and optimize video files**.**

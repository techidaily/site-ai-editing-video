Snow Effect – When you add snow effect to video online, you get to see animated snowflakes falling across the video like snowfall in the winter. You need a proper scene to add snow effect, and it represents romantic and joyous mood in a video.

Speed Change Effect – Speed change effect is extremely common whereby you can slow down and fasten up the video playing speed as per your requirements. Slow-motion video is a part of speed change effect to emphasize a scene for a long period of time.

Reverb Effect – In this video effect, you see a particular scene reverberating, especially when the subject goes into imagining things and recalling memories. You can add reverb to video online when there is a jump cut scene in your video to smoothen the transition.

Transition Effect – Transition effect is a special type of video effects that you insert when you are making a transition from one scene to another. Transition effects smoothen the scene cuts for the eyes of the audience and refresh the mind to let them focus on the next scene.

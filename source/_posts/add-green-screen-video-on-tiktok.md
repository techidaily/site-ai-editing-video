## Add Green Screen Video on TikTok

Adding green screen on TikTok videos has become a trend now as there are several green screen TikTok videos that have gone viral.

## Part 1\. How to Add Green Screen on TikTok?

To add green screen on TikTok video, you need to have a background of uniform color. It does not necessarily have to be a green screen. For example, if you are shooting a video of your legs and the floor tiles have uniform color, you can use green screen on TikTok to replace the tiles with any picture. Instead of using one picture on TikTok short video, you can use multiple pictures in the background to create stunning TikTok videos. Here are the steps on how to add multiple pictures to TikTok green screen.

Step1 Open TikTok app on your phone. Tap on Plus icon located at the bottom of the app screen to make a new video.

Step2 Choose the duration of the video as per your preference. Thereafter, tap on Effects option located at the bottom-left corner to see the different effects available on TikTok.

Step5 In order to use multiple pictures, you should stop recording in between and change your green screen image to anything you desire. Then tap on Record button again. TikTok will string your clips and it would appear that you have been changing multiple pictures of your background for your video.

If you want to experiment with green scree effects, you can scroll down after tapping on Green Screen icon under Effects. You will see different types of green screen videos possible on TikTok to choose from.

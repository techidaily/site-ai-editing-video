## Part 2\. Loop Videos on Mac with iMovie

Editing a video on a Mac is always more comfortable than on an iPhone because of the larger screen. iMovie from Apple comes pre-installed on Mac as well, and hence, you can get started right away. It is completely free to use, and hence, you do not need to install any third-party video editor. Here are the steps on how to loop an iMovie video in simple steps.

Step1 Open the iMovie app from the Applications folder.

Step2 Click on Create New option and then click on the Movie option.

Step3 Bring in the required video under Movie Library by dragging the file from Finder on your Mac. You can also go to File> Import Media option and select the required video. You can also select the required media file from Events or Photos under the Libraries section.

Step4 Drag and drop the video on your timeline. When you want to loop the video, drag and drop the video clip again on the timeline. Make sure there is no gap between the first clip and the second clip on the timeline. You can drag and drop the video clip multiple times on the timeline to increase its duration.

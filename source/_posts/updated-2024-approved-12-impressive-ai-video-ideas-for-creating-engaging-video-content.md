## Part 1: How Do Slow\-Motion Cameras Help in Recording Perfect Slow-Mo Videos?

**Slow-motion cameras** record videos at much faster speeds than regular cameras. This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These **slow-motion** **cameras** are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.

* **Higher Frame Rate:** Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But **slow-motion cameras** can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.
* **Smooth Playback:** Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.
* **High-Resolution Sensors:** Lots of **slow-motion cameras** have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.
* **Creative Control:** **Slow-motion cameras** let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.
* **Reduced Motion Blur:** More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper. This feature works especially for fast-moving things. This is important when you need to see tiny details or when the lighting isn't great.
* **Temporal Resolution: Slow-motion cameras** can record lots of details in quick movements. They're handy in sports, science, and creative videos where catching fast and detailed actions matter a lot.

## Part 1: How Do Slow\-Motion Cameras Help in Recording Perfect Slow-Mo Videos?

**Slow-motion cameras** record videos at much faster speeds than regular cameras. This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These **slow-motion** **cameras** are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.

* **Higher Frame Rate:** Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But **slow-motion cameras** can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.
* **Smooth Playback:** Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.
* **High-Resolution Sensors:** Lots of **slow-motion cameras** have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.
* **Creative Control:** **Slow-motion cameras** let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.
* **Reduced Motion Blur:** More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper. This feature works especially for fast-moving things. This is important when you need to see tiny details or when the lighting isn't great.
* **Temporal Resolution: Slow-motion cameras** can record lots of details in quick movements. They're handy in sports, science, and creative videos where catching fast and detailed actions matter a lot.

## How to Become a Youtuber?

I'm Sheila and I'm a Youtuber for five years in a row. I'm editing my vlogs using my cellphone only, not until I found this Wondershare Filmora for Personal Computers. Not like any other video editor that you need to crack your brain understanding each and every feature, this video editor that I'm talking about on the other hand, made it simple and very handy to use.

![Why I Become a Youtuber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-06.jpg)

Why I Become a Youtuber

## 1\. How I Decided to Start from Uploading the Video

But before we move forward for more details about the video editor itself, let's get back first five years ago. It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.

![Uploading the Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-07.jpg)

Uploading the Video

## 2\. The Necessary Things a Vlog Should Have

* A teaser – wherein your aim is to caught the attention of your viewers.
* An intro – what is your channel all about.
* The body of the vlog – the part wherein you're explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called **"**call of action**"** \- wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you're tackling. And last is the
* Outro – closing session of your vlog.

![Vlog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-08.jpg)

Vlog

## 3\. What Have I Encountered on the Way

As the saying goes by, **"**The beginning is always the hardest part**"** and really it was. My YouTube journey was not as easy that even my friends didn't recognize my endeavors. But still, I continue what I'm doing because I love it. It's a hobby that at the same time, I'm learning something new on the process. And also, with the help of vlogging, I'm starting to gain my self-esteem that I forgot for many years back.

![What Have I Encountered on the Way](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-09.jpg)

What Have I Encountered on the Way

It's not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you've got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who's going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who's in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who'll edit the video afterwards.

On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn't mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it's quality over quantity. You'll have to think what kind of video you'll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.

If you're a new YouTuber, you don't need to have high-end equipment's for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his/her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6\. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.

## 4\. What to Do As a YouTuber

As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you're passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you're a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.

![What to Do As a YouTuber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-10.jpg)

What to Do As a YouTuber

As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you'll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you'll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.

It's okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor's timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, **"**dead air**"** or the part that you're starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you're doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.

## 5\. How I Started Video Editing

You can insert green screen videos (that I personally love to use in my vlogs) and there's a Motion Tracker if you want to focus in an object or person in action. If you're not in the mood in editing manually, you can make a montage and the software will make it for you in the Auto Montage Maker – the software will choose the highlights of your video and deliver the results after.

Key framing is also one of the incredible features of this editor in case that you want to emphasize things in your video. To zoom in/out a certain part to be exact.

When needing of a PC screen recorder, I need another software to use. But as I've said this editor have it all. There's a built in PC screen recorder when you want to do a tutorial video.

## How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

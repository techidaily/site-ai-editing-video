## Part 2: How to Add Motion Blur to Videos in DaVinci Resolve?

DaVinci Resolve can professionally add a motion blur effect to your videos to smoothen the look. To use the **DaVinci motion blur** effect, there are two efficient ways. To learn about them in detail, read this part of the section carefully.

### 1\. On the Fusion Page

DaVinci has separate pages, like the Fusion page, for different uses. If you want to learn how to add a motion blur effect on the fusion page, check the following instructions carefully.

### What is the Fusion Page in DaVinci?

On the Fusion page, you can use captivating visual effects to add a new perspective to your videos. This page consists of a diverse range of motion graphics and visual effects. You can use retouching and repairing tools from the fusion page to generate a cinematic effect quickly.

So, by merging images, effects, and animations together, you can create a vibrant effect of your own efficiently. To add **DaVinci Resolve motion blur** on the fusion page, here are the simple steps:

Step1 Navigate to the DaVinci Resolve tool and upload your video. Now open the fusion page and press "Shift" and "Spacebar." On the search box, type “Motion” and select “Motion Blur” from the results. After selecting it, tap on the “Add” button.

![search for the motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-davinci-resolve-2.jpg)

Step2 Now, you will be able to see a nod of Motion Blur on the interface. Drag this node to the center of "Media in" and "Media Out." By selecting the motion blur node, you can adjust the settings from the right direction.

![add the motion blur node](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

Step3 You can also remove the Motion Blur node to create more enhancements. After removing it, you have to add a “Background” and connect it to Media in and Media out nodes. Now merge the nodes and navigate to “Settings.” From the settings, you can check the box of motion blur and change its elements like quality, shutter angle, etc.

![edit the settings for motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

### 2\. In the Edit Page

The Edit page in DaVinci Resolve provides you with complete freedom to add transitions, titles, and effects to the videos. On this page, you can replace, insert, overwrite and trim the clip effectively. Moreover, you can also add 2D and 3D titles to your videos on the edit page.

If you want to add a motion blur effect on DaVinci Resolve 17, you can instantly increase your work efficiency. The reason is that on DaVinci, you would be able to directly drag the motion blur effect on the editing area. Thus, it can increase your editing speed drastically. To add **DaVinci motion blur** on the editing page, read the below steps:

Step1 After accessing the DaVinci Resolve, open its edit page and upload the video. Once done, go to "Effects Library" and select "Open FX." Now from the search bar, type "Motion Blur." Select motion blur from the results and apply it to the timeline.

![search for motion blur effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-davinci-resolve-5.jpg)

Step2 On the right side, select the "Effects" tab, and then you will be able to modify the motion range, motion blur value, and other elements.

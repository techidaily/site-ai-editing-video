## Part 1: What is Blender?

### Introduction to Blender

### Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect

There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:

**· Perfect For Idolizing Speed**

The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.

**· Resolves Flickering**

Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.

**· Attenuates Real-Effect**

One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.

## Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?

As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on **how to add motion blur in Blender**:

Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the "Render Properties." Look to enable "Motion Blur" from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.

![enable the motion blur option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg)

Step2 Start by setting its "Position" in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use "Center on Frame." If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the "Shutter" value or vice versa.

![adjust the shutter value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg)

Step3 Following this, define the "Background Separation" according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the "Max Blur" pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.

![set background separation and max blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg)

Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.

## An Ultimate Guide on the Significance of Music in Videos and How to Choose the Right Music for Your Videos with Wondershare Filmora

No video is complete without suitable audio. Adding audio to a video is not that difficult, but choosing the right audio can be a hassle. You want something that captures the ears of the audience but, at the same time, compliments your video. The best way to do this is by adding music to your videos with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we'll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.

## How different types of music affect your videos

You can easily change the viewer's perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.

### Example #1

Let's say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.

![adding an uplifting beat to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-1.gif)

Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from "inspiring" to "sinister." It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.

![adding scary music to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-2.gif)

### Example #2

For a better understanding, let's look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.

![changing the music of a movie scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-3.gif)

Now that we've seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let's see how to choose the best music audio for your video.

## Tip #1: Identify the mood

As we've demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.

![identifying the mood of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-4.gif)

Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you've figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.

## Tip #2: Video and music style

We've already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?

![matching the video and audio styles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-5.gif)

Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.

![identifying the audio wave](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-6.gif)

For example, if you're using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.

## Tip #3: Don't force the music

As emphasized before, your music should match your video. We all have a favorite music genre, but sometimes that may not go well with our visuals. For example, you love country music but have a video about the nightlife in the city. Using country music in a video about the town does not match well and will confuse your audience.

![adding mismatched audio to a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-7.gif)

To get music that best suits our video, we must be open and explore all music genres. You'll see how easy it is to scout a song that fits perfectly with your visuals. The easiest way is to choose a song that gives out the same emotions as intended by the visuals.

## Final Words

Now, you clearly understand the importance of music in videos. The right music can uplift your video into a viral sensation, while the wrong music track will turn your video into a catastrophe. Remember to review the legalities of copyright and infringement before using any music in your videos to avoid legal issues. Make sure you have permission to use the music or use royalty-free music.

The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we'll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.

## How different types of music affect your videos

You can easily change the viewer's perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.

### Example #1

Let's say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.

![adding an uplifting beat to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-1.gif)

Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from "inspiring" to "sinister." It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.

### Example #2

For a better understanding, let's look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.

Now that we've seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let's see how to choose the best music audio for your video.

## Tip #1: Identify the mood

As we've demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.

![identifying the mood of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-4.gif)

Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you've figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.

## Tip #2: Video and music style

We've already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?

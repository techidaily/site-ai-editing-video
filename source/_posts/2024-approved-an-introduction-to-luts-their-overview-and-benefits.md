## 2 Methods to Cut Video in VLC on Windows

Other than playing videos and music, VLC Media Player can also be used as a video editing tool. While advanced video editing requires unconventional and powerful video editing software, VLC offers a simpler and easy-to-learn process of cutting and/or trimming videos.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-5.png)

1. **Trimming the video**

After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-6.png)

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-7.png)

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.

With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.

After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.

1. **Save and/or Import your video**

The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-9.png)

**Conclusion**

There are so many video editors, each with different features. Some are simple to use while others will require advanced software to operate. Whether you use VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora, the results will be the same. The difference comes in where you have the knowledge and skills to use one app better than the other one.

The above steps on how to use both VLC Media Player and Wondershare Filmora will guide you through the whole process. It is said that, ‘practice makes perfect’. So yes, keep practicing and putting these skills into use. Sooner or later you will be an expert!

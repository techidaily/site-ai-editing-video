## Best Ways to Blur Zoom Background for Free

Zoom's blurred backdrop function, as the name indicates, distorts the background of a video conversation. Use this zoom blur background download free guide if you wish to keep your personal area hidden during Zoom conversations in order to protect your privacy. There is a backdrop with a zoom blur all throughout. It hides the turmoil or other version of a mess from your colleagues, and it just slightly makes your hair appear odd. You may learn how to blur your backdrop using different operating systems from this page. We'll walk you through a workaround to get a blurred backdrop because the functionality is presently unavailable for mobile devices.

On your updated Zoom application, this new high res zoom background tool might be useful for a variety of reasons, whether you want to protect your privacy or conceal your filthy room. Consider a scenario in which you have a Zoom meeting but your usual workspace at home is occupied. Panic sets in because you don't have time to clean everything up or locate a private, neutral location to set up. You have features built in into Zoom to use the zoom blurred background image that would cover the area behind you, including background blurring, that's it. This simple toggleable feature is already present in Zoom and may be used to keep your area private or to make cluttered spaces uncertain. We'll provide you a step-by-step tutorial in this post on how to activate blurred backdrop for your next meeting.

## Part 1: How to blur Zoom background on Windows

Before and during meetings, users of the official Zoom desktop client for Windows have the option to blur the backdrop. Before a meeting, login into Zoom on the desktop application to activate backdrop blur. After that, choose Settings by clicking on the profile symbol in the upper left corner. Click the "Blur" option under "Backgrounds & Filters" after making your selection. The user may attend the meeting when the backdrop becomes blurry. Here are the steps to blur a Zoom backdrop during a meeting:

During a Zoom call on Windows 10, blur your backdrop as follows:

Step1Find the bar at the bottom of the meeting screen. To make it visible, you may need to move your mouse to the bottom.

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/share-screen-on-zoom.jpg)

Step2Find the "Stop Video" button, which has a chevron pointing upward.

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/stop-video-on-zoom.jpg)

Step3Then choose "Video Settings" > "Backgrounds & Filters" by clicking the arrow.

## Part 2: How to blur Zoom background on Mac

Backdrop blur is the next best thing when a virtual background is unsuitable for a video conference but a consumer still needs privacy. As you can see from the description above, the blurred backdrop is just another style of the Zoom background. Customers may therefore directly adjust it from the Virtual Background setting area. Prior doing anything further, confirm that your MacBook is running the Zoom desktop client (software).

Before your Zoom call on a Mac, follow these instructions to blur your background:

Step1Start Zoom and log in to your account.

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-cloud-login.jpg)

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-settings-bg-filters.jpg)

Step3Then choose "Blur," and your backdrop will instantly seem blurred. You can also Select Stop Video by clicking the arrow next to it in the list of choices in the bar below the live video. A little list will start to appear. By using the "Choose Virtual Backdrop" option, you may choose a virtual background.

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-blur-effect-zoom.jpg)

Step4Select "Blur" under the "Virtual Backgrounds" tab. You may choose a virtual backdrop from this page if you'd like. You need to verify that you have the right Zoom desktop program version and all the technical specs if you can't locate the Blur option.

## Part 3: How to Blur Zoom Background on iPhone

The option isn't accessible on all Apple devices since a simulated or blurred backdrop requires more computing power. First, you should visit the Zoom virtual background system requirements page to see whether your device is supported. You should continue using Zoom without a virtual or blurred backdrop if your device doesn't meet the criteria. To manually conceal your backdrop, consider standing close to a wall or sitting in a corner. Here are the instructions on how to blur your backdrop for Zoom meetings on iOS devices. Take these actions:

Step1Launch the Zoom app on your iOS phone in foremost step. To begin or join a new meeting, tap the "New Meeting" or "Join" icon.

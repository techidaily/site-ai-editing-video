For content creators and marketers, the appeal lies in the sheer virality of these videos. A compelling "motivational status video download" can quickly gain traction, garnering thousands, if not millions, of views in a short span.

## How to Make a Video with My Phone

Never before has video recording been so simple or effortless. Everybody has a smartphone, which is a capable video camera, in their pocket. In fact, the use of smartphones for mobile creation has increased to the point that some people consider it to be the main function and equally crucial to communication.

Pocket-lint has compiled ten ideas in an effort to assist you in getting whatever it is you want in the best possible way. Even if some of the advice may seem apparent, using it all should always produce fantastic videos.

![shoot a video on phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/shoot-a-video-on-phone.jpg)

## 1\. Get ready for filming

Make sure that you have everything you need to start recording your videos, including the necessary

equipment, props, scripts, actors, and locations, before you start the recording process. In addition, ensure that your mobile device is of high quality and that it has a sufficient amount of storage space (available memory) to save the film. High definition (HD) video files can be quite large and storing them can quickly deplete a battery's capacity.

![get ready for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-ready-for-filming.jpg)

They add a great point; you need to think about stabilization, and they've included a few great options for

obtaining steady video. This video by Filmic Pro titled "5 Things to Do Before You Shoot iPhone Video" covers a lot of what we've discussed as well, including memory storage, battery life, audio, and resolution.

## 2\. Use good lighting

Because smartphone cameras have smaller image sensors and lenses, proper illumination has a significant impact on their performance. As much as you can, try to film your video in well-lit environments. By doing this, you can reduce the amount of unwanted shadow and grain in your video. On the other hand, you also need to be cautious to avoid pointing the camera straight towards bright light sources because this will result in useless overexposed footage and lens flare. The lighting should be consistent and steady because most smartphone image sensors take a while to respond to abrupt changes in brightness.

![use good lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/use-good-lighting.jpg)

If shooting your video in low light is still difficult, experiment with your phone's or app's backlighting and white balance settings. In case your camera is focusing on the incorrect part of your composition, most phones now provide "touch focusing." The automatic exposure control will have an easier time making minor adjustments if the lighting condition changes once the focus has been placed on the most crucial part of the video.

## 3\. Film horizontally, not vertically

Your natural inclination may be to hold the smartphone in a vertical position when you are using it to record video, just as you do when you are using it for the vast majority of other purposes. However, if you want to edit your video and post it online and on social media, this may place certain restrictions on your ability to do so.

![film horizontally mobile phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/film-horizontally-mobile-phone.jpg)

## 4\. Make sure to have good audio

We're going to go ahead and say that sound is one of the most essential components of any video. The difficulty is in the fact that the audio quality on your smartphone is not always of the highest caliber. When it comes to audio, there is a general rule that the smartphone should be as close to the speaker as is physically possible in order to obtain the clearest sound possible from it. Even if you are only a few meters away from the person whose voice you want to record on your smartphone, you won't be able to get a good recording of them.

This is not the fault of your smartphone; rather, smartphones are intended to be used by speaking into them at close range; hence, you should think about employing the use of an external microphone in order to improve the sound quality. However, if you are unable to do so, there is no need for concern because you can use an additional smartphone in its place.

You can record audio on your mobile device by opening the voice memo app and selecting the record button. Your audio will immediately be improved if you position the phone's microphone such that it is facing your topic and is somewhat close to them. Clap once at the beginning of the recording to serve as a reference point for both the video and the audio, which will help you save time while editing. After that, it will be simple for you to locate the point at which the clap occurred and synchronize the high-quality audio that is on the memo with the audio that is in your film.

## 5\. Edit your video

Now that you've gathered all of your film, it's time to cut it up, add some color, and get creative with effects! Fortunately, there are numerous video editing apps available that make it easier and faster than ever to use. You can edit videos on your phone just as you would on a computer using apps like Adobe Rush and iMovie, and it's easier than you think.

![edit video on mobile phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/edit-video-on-mobile-phone.jpg)

You've probably heard of iMovie, Apple's free video editing software that works on both your iPhone and Mac. You can add titles, music, and additional effects to your video clips, much like in Adobe Rush. iMovie is really easy to use, especially if you're new to editing. The main distinction between Adobe Rush and iMovie is that Adobe Rush includes more professional and technical changes, whilst iMovie has a considerably larger selection of video effects and transitions.

Adobe Rush is the most user-friendly app for editing and creating high-quality films on your smartphone. One of Adobe Rush's best features is the ability to incorporate motion graphics, video effects, text, and mix audio. If you prefer a larger screen to edit on, Adobe Rush seamlessly transfers the files to your computer, allowing you to resume editing where you left off on your smartphone. This program is simple to use, and there are numerous guidelines and tutorials available online to help you get started.

## Conclusion

You probably weren't aware of this, but your smartphone is actually a very capable piece of equipment that can be used to record videos of a high quality. You will be able to enhance the quality of your material to a greater extent by putting into practice the strategies that are discussed in this piece. Grab your smartphone and get ready to start producing content that the people in your fanbase will always come back for.

## How To Add Text In After Effects

In almost every video you come across, you will see text added to the video in different parts. There are various reasons why adding text to videos becomes a necessity. First of all, you can highlight the underlying message or key points in your video. Along with audio and video, the viewers will have another cue point in the form of text that they can retain in their memory for longer. You add animated texts to video to make the video interesting to watch and break the monotony of visual cues only.

Besides, you may have to want credits and add intro as well as outro to your video where adding text is almost a necessity. Text can help your viewer get the context of your video and make sense of the content. After Effects is a popular video editor thanks to its visual effects, text animation animations, and instant video enhancement tools. We will illustrate the different ways of adding text in After Effects in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Add Text in After Effects with Horizontal Type Tool

Once you have imported your video clip into the Timeline, there are several ways you can add text to your video. First of all, you can right-click on the Timeline and select New> Text to create an empty text layer and add any text you want. Similarly, you can go to Layer> New> Text option to do the same. But the easiest way of adding text in After Effects is by using Horizontal Type Tool. Here are the steps on how you can add text in AE with the type tool.

Step1Once you have imported your video into the Timeline, click on Horizontal Type Tool located in the top bar to add any text. You can press Ctrl+T(Windows) or Command+H(Mac) to get it instantly.

![horizontal type tool ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/horizontal-type-tool-ae.jpg)

Step2Click on the video where you want to place the text and type your desired text there. After you are done adding your text, press Enter key in Num pad to exit out of the text field in the video.

![add text field ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-text-field-ae.jpg)

Step3This will automatically create a text layer on Timeline. You can now move the text and place it anywhere you want. You can also modify the text style and add animation which we will illustrate in the next section.

## Part 2\. Use the Character Panel to Edit Text in AE

When you select Type tool and add your desired text, you get a default style for the text. It is most likely that you have to modify the text style such as changing color, font, and size to fit in your video seamlessly. That is when you have to visit the Character Panel. Character Panel is where you get to edit the font of the text you have typed, increase or decrease the font size, change the font color, and much more. Apart from that, you can increase the spacing between lines when your text is a paragraph instead of a few words. Here are the steps to use Character Panel to edit text in AE.

Step1Once you have typed your text using Horizontal Type tool on the video, click on the text.

Step2Go to Character panel located in the right side of the screen. If it is minimized, click on the panel to expand it.

![character panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/character-panel-after-effects.jpg)

Step3The first option in the panel is the font of the text. By the side of the font is the text color. You can use the color picker tool to choose any color as per your preference.

![choose font color ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-font-color-ae.jpg)

Step4Below the font, you can select the font style such as regular, bold, italics, and likewise. The subsequent part is to change the font size and adjust vertical spacing between lines and horizontal spacing between characters.

![select font style ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/select-font-style-ae.jpg)

Step5The next section deals with Stroke option as well as fill the text option. You can fill the background of the text with any desired color.

![stroke option after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stroke-option-after-effects.jpg)

## Part 3\. Add Animated Text to Video with Animation Presets

Now that you have added a static text and set the text format as per your preference, it is time to animate the text. A static text in a video does not look appealing, and animated texts make the video eye-catching instantly. You can use text animation presets in After Effects to add animated text to video. Here are the steps to add animated text to video with animation presets and effects.

Step1Click on the text on your video that you want to animate. Go to Effects and Presets panel located on the right side.

![effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

Step2Under Effects and Presets panel, Click on Text option. This will open all the different categories of animation presets available that you can apply to the text on your video.

![text option under effects presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/text-option-under-effects-presets.jpg)

Step3Select any desired animation that you want to apply to the text and drag and drop the animation on the text in the composition window. Play the video and watch the applied animation on the text.

![apply text effects ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-text-effects-ae.jpg)

## Part 4\. Alternative Way to Add Text to Videos

This is because the user interface of Filmora is super simple and there are loads of text effects and animations available to enhance your video content. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a professional video editor that is extremely popular among amateur and professional video editors.

![import media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png)

Step3Drag and drop the video file from Project Media folder into the Timeline. If you have multiple video clips, you need to arrange them sequentially on the Timeline.

Step4To add text to your video, go to Titles located at the top bar. Check the left panel where you can see different categories of text effects. Select any desired text effect and drop into the Timeline. Make sure that the text layer is above the video layer on Timeline. You can shift the text layer on Timeline to place it where you want it to appear. You can also stretch the duration of the text effect as per your requirements.

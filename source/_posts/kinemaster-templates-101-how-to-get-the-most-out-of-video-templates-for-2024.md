Step 1: Launch [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline. Now, trim the music to 30 seconds and listen to the end part. Select the last note to match the beat in the beginning part of the music.

![match note with the music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-1.jpg)

Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use "M" from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.

![add markers and adjust video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg)

Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.

![create widescreen cinemascope bar opener](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-3.jpg)

Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.

![match length of whole video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-4.jpg)

Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the "Effects" tab to blur the video clips.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the "Animation" and then "Customize." Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the "Scale" percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!

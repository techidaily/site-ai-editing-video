Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.

![create widescreen cinemascope bar opener](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-3.jpg)

Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.

![match length of whole video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-4.jpg)

Step 5: After the animation is completed, head to the "Titles" tab and look for cinematic packs. Choose one and drag it onto the timeline. Secondly, alter the duration and animation of the title. The user is expected to insert a dissolve transition at the end of the title.

![adjust title of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-5.jpg)

Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the "Effects" tab to blur the video clips.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the "Animation" and then "Customize." Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the "Scale" percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!

## FLV Editors for Windows 11/10/8.1/8/7: Easily Edit FLV Videos on PC

If you are a streamer or a content creator then you undoubtedly may have come across files having .flv format. FLV stands for "Flash Video". It is a container file format like .mp4 and .mov. But it isn't used quite frequently nowadays. They are mainly used for streaming videos. Because it provides compressed video while maintaining the quality and takes less space. It supports  codec which is compatible with most of the devices but you may need a flash player to play these files. If you have recently started working with .flv files or need more info about it then read till the end. We have gathered all the necessary information for you in this article.

Being a content creator, you can't just record videos and publish them directly. Sometimes it requires finishing touches or an entirely new look, for this purpose you need a good editor. And if you are working with .flv files then selecting a good editing software that supports .flv files is important. So, here we have mentioned a list of FLV video editors. You can select one depending on your needs and budget.

**Best FLV Editor to Edit FlV Video on Windows and Mac:**

* **Wondershare – Filmora:**

 **It is available for both Windows and Mac.**

[Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most common and versatile editing software in this list that almost every content creator may have used or heard about. It has a lot of professional features used by content creators. It is one of the best video editors for .flv format, if u work with .flv files then you must get your hands on filmora.

Its UI is quite similar to premiere pro which makes it quite easy for people who are looking for premiere pro alternatives. It has hundreds of classy transitions/effects and dozens of unique and useful features but many of them are available on paid version only.

The free version also packs a punch but it is almost useless for most users as it leaves a watermark on the final product. It is good for learning video editing and once you master enough to move forward then you can purchase the pro version or you can start directly on the paid version.

Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.

**How to play .FLV files?**

To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that's not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.

If you don't want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.

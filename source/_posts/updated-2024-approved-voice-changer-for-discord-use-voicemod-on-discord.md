## Conclusion

We have illustrated how to speed up a video in Lightworks. However, you can only choose from the fixed presets available in Lightworks. If you want to customize the speed of your video, Wondershare Filmora is a better alternative to Lightworks. Several methods are available to change your video's speed in Filmora. Therefore, you can get the desired video output in simpler steps.

### Method 1\. Change The Speed of Video From Presets

We have stated how to speed up a video in Lightworks from presets. The same method is available on Filmora as well. You can choose from the different preset speed options. This is the easiest way to speed up or slow down your video. In comparison to Lightworks, Filmora has more preset options. Here are the steps to speed up video by choosing a preset in Filmora.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Install Filmora on your computer. It is available for Windows and macOS. Launch Filmora and select Create New Project option.

Step2 You need to import the desired video file in Filmora. Go to File> Import Media and select the Import Media Files option. You can browse your computer to select the video file whose speed you want to change. The chosen video file will be included in the Project Media folder. You can even drag and drop the target video file from your computer to the Project Media folder.

### Method 2\. Customize The Change of Speed in Wondershare Filmora

You may want to set a speed that is not available on the preset list. Filmora has come up with the Uniform Speed option to let you customize the speed of the video as per your requirements. You can choose from 0.01X to 100X speed, and the chosen speed will be applied to the video uniformly. Here are the steps to follow.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file from the Project Media folder onto the timeline. Click on the Speed icon located at the top of the timeline.

Step2 From the menu, select the Uniform Speed option. You will see the Uniform Speed tab above the timeline.

![select the uniform speed option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-12.jpg)

Step3 You need to move the speed slider to set the desired speed for your video. You can play the video to see how the video speed changes.

Step4 If satisfied with the result, click on the Ok button. Thereafter, you can export the video file in any file format.

### Method 3\. Use Speed Ramping to Customize Your Video

Speed ramping is a unique way to change video speed. It is useful for advanced video editors that want to vary the speed differently for different sections of the video. You can set the graph with nodes as per your requirements. According to the graph you have designed, your video speed will vary. Here is how to use speed ramping to change the speed of your video.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline and click the Speed icon.

Step2 Click Speed Ramping option from the menu. You will see Speed Ramping tab above the timeline.

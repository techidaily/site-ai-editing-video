**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-21.jpg)

1. Next, from the ‘**Choose function**’ drop-down menu, scroll to  (it's the first under **Output codecs**). You will now see some new options in a new panel that appears on the right-hand side of the Shutter Encoder window. From there, if you want to crop the video, click the **Crop** checkbox:

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-22.jpg)

1. A new window will pop up where you can use your mouse to crop the video to the desired size. If you want to change it to a predefined, fixed-size ratio value, uncheck the ‘**Manual mode’** box, and you'll be able to choose a ratio from the ‘**Pre-settings’** drop-down.

1. Next, if you want to change the  profile, expand the ‘**Advanced features’** item in the Shutter Encoder sidebar, check the box for the **Force profile** option, then change the profile to what you want to use:

**AVIDEMUX**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-25.jpg)

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Features:**

* Multiple Formats
* Video Filters
* Advanced Interlacing
* Full Editing Control
* Simple Interface
* Open Source

**Pros:**

* Covers standard formats.
* All essential features are present.
* Surprisingly advanced filtering, processing, editing, and filtering controls.
* The interface is easy to learn.
* Open-source

**Cons:**

* The interface is very legacy and needs remodeling
* No longer updated
* No support

**Steps On How To Cut Videos On Avidemux:**

1. Open up Avidemux, and load the video file that you want to work with. If you get a prompt like this one: we recommend clicking Yes to use the safer mode.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-26.jpg)

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-27.jpg)

1. Find the portion of the video that you’d like to isolate. Get as close as you can to the start of the clip you want to cut.

1. You want it to read I; if it isn’t framed type I, then use the single left and right arrow buttons to go forward or backward one frame until you find an appropriate I frame.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-28.jpg)

1. Once you’ve found the right starting frame, click the button with the A over a red bar. This will set the start of the clip.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-29.jpg)

1. Advance to where you want your clip to end. Click on the button with a B when you’ve found the appropriate frame. This frame can be of any type.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-30.jpg)

1. You can now save the clip, either by going to **File –> Save –> Save Video**, or by pressing **Ctrl+S**. Give the file a name, and Avidemux will prepare your clip.

**BEST PAID FFMPEG ALTERNATIVE TO CUT VIDEO ON MAC**

**JOYOSHARE MEDIA CUTTER**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-31.jpg)

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

The best video cutting tool is Joyoshare Media Cutter for Windows (or Mac). As a professional video trimmer, it allows you to cut your media files at a 60X faster rate, allowing you to clip a 60-minute video or audio file in just one minute. The interface design is also simple and clean, allowing you to do it quickly.

Another noteworthy feature is the ability to easily cut and merge both video and audio without sacrificing quality. The cropper supports a variety of video and audio formats, including AVI, MP4, MPEG, VOB, WMV, ASF, RM, RMVB, 3GP, MP3, WMA, M4R, and others, allowing you to save the file in any format and on any device, including Apple.

More notably, this is a capable all-in-one video cutter. In addition to cutting videos and audio, it can convert all popular video formats, extract audio from video files, and merge video and audio files from the same source into a new one.

**Features:**

### Convert to Any File Format

### Merge Video and Audio Files into Multiple Formats

### Improved Accuracy & Efficiency in Cutting Videos

### 60X Fast Conversion

**Pros:**

* Offers an easy way to cut, merge, and convert video files
* Blazing fast video-cutting and file-conversion speed
* Supports multiple audio and video file formats

**Cons:**

* Can only merge videos from the same source. That means you can’t use the program to merge separate videos from your gallery.
* The program doesn’t offer an easy way to remove an unwanted part of a video if it’s in the middle of the video. The only way to do that is by cutting the section before and after the video, then merging them into one.

**Steps:**

### **Step 1: Adding Video**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-32.jpg)

To add a video, click the “**Open**” button. Locate the video you want to trim from your collection and open it. Alternatively, you can use the drag-and-drop feature.

### **Step 2: Select the Segment to Be Trimmed**

At the bottom of the Joyoshare video window, you’ll be able to see a time slider through which you can skip to your desired timeframe. Move the slider handles attached to the yellow timeline bar to set the starting and ending points of your video.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-33.jpg)

Once you’ve set your desired starting point, click on the “\[” button to highlight the starting segment, then move the right-hand slider to select the ending point, and click the \] button to set the end segment.

### **Step 3: Choose Your Desired Output Format and Destination Folder**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-34.jpg)

Click the “Format” button, and a new window will pop up where you’ll be able to choose your preferred output format.

### **Step 4: Trim the Video**

Click the “Start” button to begin trimming the segment. Wait for a minute for the program to finalize trimming the segment, then click the save button. That’s it! You’ve successfully trimmed your first video.

If you wish to cut and merge several segments, click the “+” icon at the bottom of the segments tab, then follow the above procedure to create several segments.

Xilisoft Video Cutter goes beyond standard cutting or slicing by allowing you to convert your video input files to a variety of well-known codecs.

1-2-3 Interface

Multilingual Interface

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-43.jpg)

You can also set several segments. Click the "Show Advanced Mode" button and click the "New Clip" button in advanced mode to set the start and endpoints of the segments. Repeat the above steps to set several segments.

Tip: To delete a segment, please choose the segment in the segment list, and click the "Delete Clip" button on the toolbar; to adjust the segment order, please choose the segment and click the "Move Up" or "Move Down" button to adjust its order.

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID VIDEO CUTTER ON MAC?**

Whether you choose Free or Paid Video Cutter, it still depends on your edit and navigation if the project will succeed like what you’re anticipating. Beginners in the industry can go for Free Video Cutters to practice the craft without worrying about the monthly subscription.

However, if you’re a professional, I highly suggest that you choose Paid Video Cutter to lessen the hassle and create amazing output.

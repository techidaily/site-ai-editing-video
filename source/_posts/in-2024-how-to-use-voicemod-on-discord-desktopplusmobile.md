## How to Remove Audio From Videos with FFmpeg?

Unbelievably, the globe has been making headway in its endeavors. Considering how far the world has come in producing amazing things in recent times, it is impossible to fathom the progress made in the digital industry. There are now millions of video editing programs like **FFmpeg that remove audio**, each allowing you to accomplish anything. In addition to video editing, it is now possible to modify the music playing in the backdrop of a video. Doesn't it seem impossible to you? However, it has an actual appearance and is simple to pull audio from a video. You will, however, need to choose a tool with great care and consideration.

In the following parts, we will discuss how to **remove audio from video with FFmpeg** successfully. In addition, we have also looked at other software that has the potential to be an alternative to FFmpeg that is far more effective.

![remove audio from video ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Use FFmpeg to Remove Audio from Videos?

FFMPEG is a highly flexible video editing program from the command line. You may use it for various purposes, including converting between different file formats. But in addition to that, you may use it to **remove audio from your videos** or clips. Here are two different ways to delete audio using FFMPEG, depending on what you want to do. But most crucially, speed and quality are not sacrificed with any of these choices. It's about coding. When using other people's code, also label the author. Using FFmpeg, you can separate the audio. The audio in video files may be removed, added, extracted, and added again with the help of this powerful utility.

You will only need to [**install FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) on your computer after you have purchased it. Removing video is straightforward, so you won't have to put in much effort to achieve this goal. Let's look at the many methods available.

**Use the Command Line**

Step1 The command to extract audio from your video file is visible for your review.

![ffmpeg use the command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-2.jpg)

Step2 It would be helpful if you updated the extension and the name of the file that was entered, but other than that, you won't need to do anything else.

![ffmpeg audio command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-3.jpg)

The preceding command is successful if the input file certifies. This is why you need to find the codec for the audio stream. If you obey this order, you will accomplish what you set out to do. A user might sometimes use an audio format returned by the previous command. However, this will only occasionally be successful.

The storage format that FFmpeg employs is determined by looking at the output file's extension. It would help if you knew that a storage format, a container, and an audio format are distinct. You will encounter a scenario where the audio format does not have a container named after it. Two problematic formats are among the most common formats; they are PCM and Vorbis. OGG is compatible with Vorbis, whereas WAV is compatible with PCM.

Let's investigate another approach to extract audio from a video using FFmpeg if the prior one was too difficult for you to grasp.

**Use the Terminal**

Step1 Verify that the format remains the same.

You will need to locate the video in its original format to be able to extract the audio from it. If you are unfamiliar with the primary format, you will be unable to determine the appropriate file extension. Because of this, you are going to need to make use of the ffprobe command.

![ffmpeg check the original format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-4.jpg)

Now, change "myvideo.mp4" to the name of the video file you want to use. This will verify that you are familiar with the video's original file format.

After learning about the original audio's format, you can reencode a video clip to remove the audio from it.

![ffmpeg reencoding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-5.jpg)

Step2 Modify the format, please.

You might try replacing myvideo.mp4 with the directory and filename to see if it helps. Additionally, it would be helpful if you updated the name of the audio.ogg file with the name you want to use.

Therefore, if you follow the two approaches discussed above, you can extract audio from your video files with little to no work. To completely comprehend the stages, you must examine them in great detail.

A studio can be a corner of a room or if you have an extra space, you can dedicate an entire room to be your filming studio. Then get your camera or smart phone set up on a stable table with your cellphone stand to make it sturdy and make sure you have a suitable lighting.

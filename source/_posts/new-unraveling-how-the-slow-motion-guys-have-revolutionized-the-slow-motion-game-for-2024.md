Step 1

[Download Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Let it install and wait for it to run. Then, click on **“New Project”.** Now, you’re ready to edit!

Step 2

First, go to **Titles** and drag the Default Title to the Timeline.

![default title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/default.png)

Step 3

Now, double-click on the Default Title clip. Here, change its font to any bold font. Increase the text size to 120\. Type in your text in the box. Scroll a bit down and change the **Text Spacing** to **8\.** Click **OK.**

![edit text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-text.png)

Step 4

Take a Snapshot of this Default Title.

![take snapshot filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png)

Step 5

Double-click on the Default Title clip once again. This time, click on its **Advanced** settings. Here, turn OFF **Text Fill →** turn ON **Outline →** change the Outline color to **White →** reduce **Thickness** to **1\.** Click **OK.** Now, take another Snapshot.

![advanced title settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/advanced.png)

Step 6

Delete the Default Title clip from the Timeline. Now, drag the Outline snapshot that we just created to the Timeline. Open the **Crop** tool **→** change the Ratio to **Custom** **→** replace “**1080**” with “**540**”. Lastly, move the highlighted crop section to the top. Click **OK.**

![crop filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/crop.png)

Step 7

Double-click on the Snapshot to open its settings panel. Go to the **Animation** tab. Here, change the value of the **Y-axis** to “**275**”**.** Click **OK.** Now, take a Snapshot.

![y axis value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/y-axis.png)

Step 8

Next, click on the **Crop** tool again and simply move the highlighted crop section to the bottom part of the screen. Click **OK.** Then, double-click on the snapshot clip in the Timeline and change the value of the **Y-axis** from “275” to “**\-275**”**.** Click **OK.** Take a Snapshot again.

Step 9

Import a background image to **My Media.** Drag the background image to the Timeline. Double-click on it and drag the **Scale** bar until the background image covers the whole screen. Click **OK.** You should cut the background clip to make it 3 seconds long as well.

![edit image scale filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/scale.png)

Step 10

Lock this track in the Timeline by pressing the highlighted button on the left. Then, go to **“Track Manager”** and add 6 new Tracks to the Timeline. Click **OK.**

![add tracks to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/tracks.png)

Step 11

Drag the first Snapshot we made before to Track 6\. Cut it so it's 3 seconds long. Then, **Lock** the Track.

![lock track filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lock.png)

Step 12

Set the Playhead at the 15th frame on the Timeline. Then, drag the **Upward Outline** snapshot to this point. Double-click on it and change the **Y-axis** value to “**\-4%**”. Then, reduce the **Opacity** to **0%.** Now, move the Playhead 5 frames further. Next, increase the **Opacity** to **100%** and increase the **Y-axis** value to around **“105”.** Don’t click **OK** yet.

Step 13

Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 5 seconds on the Timeline. Add a keyframe by clicking on the **“+Add”** button. Then, move the Playhead 5 frames forward. Here, change the **Zoom Level** to **25%.**

![zoom level filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/zoom.png)

Step 14

Double-click on the clip in Track 5\. Drag the text like in the image below. Then, delete the part of the clip on the right side after 1 minute and 15 seconds.

![edit clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/stretch.png)

Step 15

Hide the clips on Track 6 and Track 1 by clicking the “eye” icons next to them. Then, take a Snapshot. Now, drag this Snapshot right next to the clip on Track 5.

![add snapshot in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/insert-snapshot.png)

Step 16

Move the Playhead 3 frames forward from the starting point of the clip you just added. Unhide Track 6\. Double-click on the clip on the right side of Track 5 and click on **“+Add”.** Move the Playhead 5 seconds forward and adjust the Upward Outline to fit the text.

![stretch text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/fit.png)

Step 17

Move the Playhead 5 frames forward again. Drag the **Y-axis** value to the left until the outline clip overlaps the main text. Then, reduce the **Opacity** to **0%.** Move the Playhead to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Cut the Track and delete the clip on the right side. Lastly, **Lock** Track 5.

![edit track five](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/track-five.png)

Step 18

Drag the **Downward Outline** snapshot to Track 4\. Then, repeat the same process as in **Step 16** and **Step 17.**

Step 19

Drag the Upward Outline snapshot to Track 3 at the 17th frame. Double-click on it and change the **Opacity** to **0%.**

![insert snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/topside.png)

Step 20

Now, move 5 frames forward and increase the **Opacity** back to **100%.** Then, drag the **Y-axis** value to the right until the screen looks like this.

![move clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edge.png)

Step 21

Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 5 seconds. Click on **“+Add”** to add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead 5 frames forward. Double-click on the clip and stretch it from side to side to match something like this.

![resize clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resize.png)

Step 22

Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 16 seconds. Split the clip and delete the part on the right side. Hide Track 4, 5, and 6\. Then, take a Snapshot. Drag this Snapshot next to the clip on Track 3\. Place the Playhead on 1 minute and 18 seconds. Then, unhide Track 4, 5, and 6.

Step 23

Double-click on the clip on the right side of Track 3\. Add a keyframe by pressing **“+Add”.** Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 23 seconds. Now, resize the clip back to its original size by moving the rectangle left and right. Right now, it should look like this.

![preview screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/preview.png)

Step 24

Move the Playhead 5 frames forward. Drag the **Y-axis value** to the left until the screen looks like this.

![move clip downward](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/overlap.png)

Step 25

Move the Playhead 5 frames forward again. Drag the value of the **Y-axis** to the left until the screen looks like this. Then, change the **Opacity** to **0%.** Finally, split the clip at 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Delete the part on the right side. Lock Track 3.

![move outline down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/last-overlap.png)

Step 26

Next, drag the Downward Snapshot on Track 2 and follow the same process as in **Steps 19 through 25.**

Step 27

Unhide the Background clip at the bottom of the Timeline. Then, Unlock Track 6\. Split the clip on Track 6 at the 15th frame.

![split clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/split.png)

Step 28

Move the Playhead at the beginning of the Timeline. Click on the first part of the clip on Track 6\. Add a keyframe. Drag the **X-axis** value to the right until the word disappears out of the screen. Like this. 👇Then, move the Playhead to the 6th frame and **Reset** the X-axis value to **0.0.**

![drag word out of screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/disappear.png)

Step 29

Take the Playhead to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Split it. Now, move the Playhead to 2 minutes and 19 seconds and add a keyframe. Lastly, take the Playhead to the very end of the clip and drag the text to the right side until it's out of the screen once again.

![drag text out of screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-text.png)

Step 30

Go to the **Effects** tab. Select **Glitch** from the panel on the left. Then, apply **“Glitch Dispersion”** and **“Glitch Stripe 2”** to the clips at the start and at the end.

![apply effects filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/effect.png)

Step 31

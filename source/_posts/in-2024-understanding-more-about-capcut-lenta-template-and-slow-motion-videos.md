### What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?

VHS, also known as Video Home System, are the auditory artifacts and visual glitches you see in the pictures. It creates a sense of distortion in the video, making the viewer think the camera equipment is malfunctioning. From the 1980s to the 1990s, this effect gained considerable popularity among video creators and viewers.

In recent years, retro lovers have brought this intuitive effect again into a trend to create a perfect flashback scene. The nostalgic and vintage appeal of these effects is insane. VHS is not just one effect because it divides into further categories. You are also free to select the VHS effects according to the theme of your video and the scene you are going to create.

### Key Aspects of The VHS Effects

Several key aspects are crucial to making high-quality VHS effects in the videos. You can see some of the key aspects listed and discussed here:

* **Video Color Bleeding:**You must have noticed that color is bleeding in the VHS videos. In this, the colors in the videos are quite smudged and mixed. This together adds the unique yet smoother distortion in the videos.
* **Vintage and Glitching:**Vintage and glitches are essential to videos with VHS effects. This was initially caused by the limitations of playback equipment and signal interference. At this time, people add **glitch VHS** to the videos in a manual manner to add a sense of interference in the scene.
* **Noise and Jitters:**VHS tapes are known to be susceptible to wrappings and jitters. It causes a slightly unstable effect in the videos in the form of distorted objects. Moreover, the grainy and noisy appearance due to analog recording technology is also a part of this effect.

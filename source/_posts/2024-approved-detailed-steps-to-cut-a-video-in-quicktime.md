## Detailed Steps to Cut a Video in QuickTime

Filming a video is fun and editing is more interesting and entertaining. Today, everyone is making videos and there are tons of videos on the internet. Editing videos is required to make the video stand out and retain the audience. Video trimming helps you cut out the unwanted part of the video and leave the desired portion of the viewers.

**Cutting a video means your video starts quickly and you don’t lose your audience’s attention**.

The first ten seconds of the video are very important when deciding whether to stay or move on to the next video.

## **How to cut a video in QuickTime**

Quicktime is an authentic application developed by Apple in 1991\. It allows the users to edit, record, play, and share videos and pictures. If some editing software confuses you, **QuickTime** is just for you.

You need to download the application and here are all the features you can enjoy. It is compatible with all versions of windows whereas, if you are a Mac user it is already installed in your system.

Cutting a video is one of the basic but useful functions of QuickTime. It requires a few simple steps and some features related to cutting, splitting, and trimming a video.

Let’s start…

### **1\.** **Cutting/splitting a video**

Cutting a video means splitting some parts of the video to edit and rearrange the clips to make a new video. Mostly, it is used where you want to edit all clips of the video differently. It is also needed as it allows you to focus on your message and delete the portion not required and make the video large. You can remove the extra fat from the video to give clarity, direction, and hope. You can convey your message in a clear and concise way.

These steps should be followed to cut/split the video in minutes.

* In the **QuickTime player**, open the desired video.
* Select **show clips** from the **view** on the menu bar.
* Move the red marker from right to left to select the desired portion.
* Hit **split clip** from the **edit**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-1.png)

* A yellow rectangular bar appears over the edges of your video.
* You can cut the desired portion and make editing as you like.
* Repeat the sequence until you are done.
* Press the **done**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-2.png)

Cutting the video by splitting is used when you have a long video and you can easily edit them by splitting them into two parts.

### **2\.** **Trimming a video**

If you are cutting some parts at the beginning and the end of the video, it is called trimming a video. You can say it as removing unnecessary preparation scenes. Normally, professionals start their cameras before the film scene to ensure not to miss any part of the video. Here’s, how to trim video in the QuickTime player.

Let’s dive in…

* Launch **QuickTime**
* Select your **video** from the system.
* Select **edit** from the top menu.
* Select the **trim** or **command T**, or you can select the **hold** option from the drop-down list.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-3.png)

* A **yellow trimming bar** will appear over the edges of your video.
* Remove the unwanted area by moving from the right or left **trim edges** also called **handles**.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-4.png)

Everything inside the **yellow bars** will remain. You can preview your video anytime during the editing process.

* Hit the **trim** from the bottom right corner.
* Select save from the file on the top menu bar.

Trimming is critical because it is the time to convince the viewers to stick around and stay with your video.

But some users face problems with the installation process of Sony Vegas Pro 13, 14 versions. Many individuals have got different difficulties.

Cropping means cutting off a part of the video. Instead of enlarging the video by moving its borders, you have to trim it from both sides. The editing procedure includes removing unwanted parts from short videos, making them shorter and more effective. It can also create suspense or interest for audiences. Here are the steps to crop a video in Sony Vegas Pro:

## **Step-by-step on how to crop videos using Vegas Pro?**

Step 1: Click on ‘Import’ and import the video to be edited. Click on it and drag-drop to timeline. You can see a green indicator in the form of a splitter between two clips in the timeline, which shows where the clip ends and starts playing.

Step 2: Open the video you want to edit, in the timeline of your project. Right-click on the clip and select "Video Event Pan/Crop".

Step 3: Alternatively, you can also select crop effect by pressing the icon in the clip. Or, select the Crop icon from the toolbar to add it to a track.

Step 4: The crop window will pop up. You can now drag the dotted rectangle to the 'crop' part of the video that you want. Press enter once done to apply the crop. You can also use the "Previous Frame" or "Next Frame" button to navigate to another frame of your video and drag the dotted rectangle from there, without changing your current frame.

Step 5: When you have finished adjusting the crop area, go to File > Export > Render Video. In the Render Video window that pops up, select the file format and quality of your render. You can also adjust the size, frame rate, and bitrate options from here. Once ready, press "Render" to begin rendering your video with the cropped area. This will give you a new output video where only the selected portion of the previous video is visible.

## How to Make Censor Effects with Filmora

There are many aspects to consider when it comes to publishing a video. Safety and privacy aspects are some of them. If you're looking to blur out a bystander or cut out profanities from your video with Filmora, this is the right article for you.

## Part 1\. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora

Filmora's powerful video editing menu includes easy tweaking on audio. You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.

Step1 Create a new project and import the video to Filmora.

![import the video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 Separate the audio component from the video by right-clicking on the video and selecting the Detach Audio option. You can now edit each of them individually.

![detach the audio component](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Mark the part to place the start of the beep using the playhead and click the Split icon on the editor’s toolbar.

![split to separate the target segment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-3.gif)

Step4 Place the playhead at the end of the censored segment and click Split. Double-click on the segment to open the audio editing menu, then you can remove that part of the audio or lower the volume.

![adjusting the split audio segment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-4.jpg)

Step5 Click the **Audio>Audio** Effects menu on the upper left corner of the screen. After you find the Beep effect, drag the track to the audio timeline and place it in between the split section. Adjust trimming and volume until the censor is placed correctly.

## Part 2\. How to add mosaic to video with Filmora

Whether you want to hide a passerby's face or your own, or even other types of objects, Wondershare Filmora is ready to take on the task. While its nifty face-off function automatically follows the movement of a marked face, the mosaic effect is the fast and perfect solution for a static object in the video.

Step1 After importing a video to Filmora, tap on the Effects tab and find the Mosaic filter from the gallery.

![find the mosaic effect from the effects library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-6.jpg)

Step2 Drag the Mosaic filter to the timeline just above the main video track.

![drag the mosaic effect to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-7.jpg)

Step3 A yellow box will appear in the viewer. You can drag and adjust its size to hide the targetted object. You can also adjust the opacity and intensity of the effect using the adjustment menu, accessible when you double-click the yellow box.

![adjust the mosaic effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-8.jpg)

If the targetted object moves, you can set the automatic tracking before adding the mosaic filter by clicking on the **Motion Tracking**\>**Start Tracking** located above the timeline. Before you place the filter, preview and adjust the tracking frame to ensure tight proof censor.

## Progressive Solutions to Adding VHS Effects to Video with Ease

Good videos with great edits and effects undoubtedly create a last impression. Videos are like windows to the past, allowing us to relive precious moments and memories. Similarly, good-looking videos have this remarkable ability to last forever. Even when it comes to content creation, videos are a great engagement tool. They engage audiences like no other medium can, conveying emotions and messages.

However, **VHS effects** have added more spice to the content creation and the creative work behind it. They give a normal video a distinct character and style, further improving it. By applying **VHS filters**, you can change the mood of your videos entirely. Applying these effects to your videos sometimes becomes difficult. However, there is always a simple solution to apply VHS to your videos.

## Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview

People from the 80s would remember the good old days when they used to watch movies on VHS tapes. In simple terms, the **VHS effect** is a style that tries to recreate the look of VHS recordings. It's a nostalgic-style effect that has gained popularity in recent years. You can apply different filters and techniques to your videos to achieve this effect.

These techniques aim to replicate the features of VHS tapes. The key features of the VHS filters include distortion, noise, and tracking errors. Distortion and noise create flickering lines and static. Furthermore, the tracking errors give the impression of an unstable video signal. These elements make the video appear just like the old VHS tapes from the 80s.

Additionally, color grading plays an important role in creating this effect. VHS tapes had a unique color palette with saturated and slightly shifted colors. You can replicate this effect by adjusting and applying color grading effects.

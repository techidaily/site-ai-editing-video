## Twitch Green Screen Guide

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished. With Twitch green screen background, you can easily configure Chroma key settings and detect your green screen with a single click.

The twitch green screen attaches directly to the back of your chair. You don't have to worry about stands, or spacing behind your chair. Just attach it and go. This portable green screen can fit on the back of your chair a feature that makes it easy to assemble and use for start-up twitchers.

## How to set up a Green Screen with Twitch Studio

****Set Up Your Camera**

First things first, make sure that your camera is being detected on Twitch Studio. If you do not already have a layer with your webcam on your scene, click Edit Scene and add a webcam layer by clicking the + icon on the left next to Layers.

Once your webcam layer has been created, make sure that the desired device is selected, plugged in, and that you have not turned off every webcam (Camera icon on the bottom left of Twitch Studio).

****Set Up Your Green Screen**

Once your green screen is set up in your background, select your webcam layers to display your webcam settings.

We recommend using the Auto-Detect Color feature as it will automatically detect the best color code for you and will be a great base to work from. If you prefer, you can manually pick the color code by either providing the color code in the Color to Remove field or clicking on the colored square to display a color spectrum that you can select from.

The Chroma Key section is located at the bottom of the webcam settings, and you will be able to toggle the chroma key on and off by clicking the eye icon.

To adjust the chroma key settings, you can click on Edit Chroma Key. You will be able to change the color code and change similarity, edge transparency and color correction for the perfect fit.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

## Part 4: Hot FAQs on GIF Instagram

### How can I send a GIF on Instagram DM?

You can easily share a GIF file directly on Instagram DM by clicking the Share icon at the top-right corner before opening a chat. Now tap the Stickers icon on the text message field and choose GIF. Search for a GIF file from GIPHY and click GIF to share it. It’s that easy!

### How can I add a GIF to Instagram Story using a sticker?

To add a GIF Sticker on Instagram, you’ll first need to convert GIF to APNG (Animated PNG) using a program like [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/gif-to-apng). Then, upload the APNG file on [GIPHY Sticker Maker](https://giphy.com/create/gifmaker) and generate a sticker. Now launch Instagram and choose a photo to post on your story. Then, click the Sticker icon and search for your username on GIPHY. Lastly, choose the GIF sticker you had created earlier and upload it.

### How can I post GIFs to my Instagram Feed and Stories?

Posting a GIF file on Instagram Feeds and Stories is nothing complex. Simply install the GIPHY app and then choose a GIF file you want to share. After that, hit the Share button and then click the Instagram logo. Finally, select Post or Stories and share the GIF file.

## Final Words

Although you may not be able to upload GIFs on Instagram directly, the above methods make it a breeze by converting GIFs to MP4 with lossless quality. Remember that you can easily share a GIF on your Instagram Story or Feed directly from GIPHY. But you can only do that using the iPhone or Android GIPHY app. Give it a try!

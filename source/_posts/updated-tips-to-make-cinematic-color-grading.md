## Tips to Make Cinematic Color Grading

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

## Part 1\. What is Cinematic Color Grading?

The cinematic look is all the rage these days and aims to mimic images captured on real film rather than digitally created. To achieve this effect, film directors use various means from lighting to cinematic color gradation. The latter is a powerful tool for bringing a cool or warm tone to a video and providing smooth color transitions to fall on an image that doesn't look too real but feels emotional.

This kind of post-production processing, which produces beautiful results when used by color magicians, requires a deep understanding of colors and their effect on our psyche and even physiology. It's not enough to watch a color grading video and use a LUT to get where you want. You should at the very least have an understanding of:

* Color wheel
* Color quality
* Color harmony and discord
* Warm and cool colors
* Color context

## Part 2\. Tips to make cinematic color grading

Here are three helpful tips to create cinematic-looking images in DaVinci Resolve.

In my 10-year career as a colorist, I've worked on every type of content imaginable: short, long, commercial, educational, episodic—you name it. And while each of these formats requires its approach, the one constant that spans them all is the client's desire for a cinematic look.

Virtually all of us aspire to more cinematic color, but we often come up short—in part because the term itself has become too broad to effectively target. To focus on the goal, I like to think of "cinematic" as "an image whose key visual properties are consistent with those of printed film."

The print film was the primary medium through which we consumed cinematic images for the first century of filmmaking and is therefore at the very heart of cinematic aesthetics. In this video, I'll show you my top three secrets to achieving this aesthetic quickly and consistently in Davinci Resolve.

### Tips1: Create Color Density

The first secret to film color is to create color density. Another key aesthetic property of film images is that colors can be either highly saturated or highly luminescent but cannot be both.

We can mimic this visual characteristic by identifying strongly saturated colors in our image and using the Hue vs. Lum to reduce their brightness. This simple technique is especially effective on pure primary colors (red, green, and blue).

![create color density](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-1.jpg)

### Tips2: Separation Beats Saturation

The second secret to film color is prioritizing separation over saturation. When you feel like an image lacks overall color or pop, it's all too easy to reach for the saturation knob, but that's not a very cinematic solution.

Instead, try using split toning—pushing cool colors into shadows and warm colors into highlights—to increase tonal separation and add depth to an image. This characteristic is present in virtually every film print and is deeply evocative when applied correctly.

### Tips3: Strong Contrast is Your Friend

The third secret of film colors is a strong contrast. This is not always easy, as a higher contrast look inherently requires more precision with exposure placement. Too often we pump up some contrast, end up with an image that looks blown out or too crisp, and then immediately back away from editing.

However, if you stick with high contrast long enough to improve your exposure, you'll get a very different result and be well on your way to a more cinematic image.

## Part 3\. How to add color cinematic grading by using Filmora?

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an option if you want to easily change the colors of your projects. You may just double-click the media after dragging it onto the editing timeline to change the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue.

Despite its speed, it also allows you to merge, edit audio, divide, rotate, and apply as many cool video effects as you like.

##### Step1Add the media

After installing Wondershare Filmora, click the New Project and Import button to easily find and load your videos.

![add the media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

##### Step2Correct the color \[Basic and Advanced\]

In the timeline, double-click the video editing window. Select the **"Color"** panel and make adjustments.

![color panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

* Contrast: By adjusting this setting, you can control the brightness and color in different parts of the image.
* Saturation: This setting highlights the gray part of the video to a shade. You can adjust it to make the colors of the entire video image appear more saturated or more subdued.
* Brightness: You can change this setting to adjust the overall darkness and lightness of your project.
* Hue: Hue is generally the lightness of a color. Let's say that when red is saturated with white, it creates a shade of pink.
* 3D LUT: 3D lookup tables provide your media with Hollywood movie color sets like the 007 series, Batman, Harry Porter, etc.

Hover over the indicator to adjust the color correction settings. Then left click on it and move the slider. The corresponding value stabilizes after releasing the mouse button.

With Filmora, you also have access to advanced color correction. Click the Advanced Color Tuning icon to enter the appropriate window where you can fine-tune the color or use preset templates.

The Preferences tab has a variety of templates, including Movie, Normal, 3D LUT, and Vignette. In the Edit tab, you can adjust color temperature, white balance, hue, 3D LUT, color, HSL, light, vignette, etc.

##### Step3Preview and save the new video

When you are satisfied with your creation, click "Export". Then click the Settings button and save the new videos in different formats in the Format tab. You can also export the video directly to Vimeo or YouTube or burn it to DVD for better preservation.

Filmora's color correction tools will make your videos look natural, more attractive, more vibrant, consistent, and professional.

**Color Correction Presets**

[Color correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) presets help your video achieve an enhanced **cinematic look**. Adjust gives you control over fine-tuning the colors in your shots. You can make various adjustments such as color temperature and exposure.

In the **“Effects > LUT”** tab, you'll see an extensive selection of preset color settings. These include Vignettes, Movie Looks Like Old Movies, and Cinematic 3D LUT effects such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, and Mission Impossible.

![effects lut tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

## Best Ideas for Time Lapse Video

Are you thinking of stepping out of the familiar world of still photography to make a time-lapse video?

As you all know I am a fan of travel videos and time-lapse video because why not? There is no denying that time-lapse techniques are a perfect medium for travel videos.

In this article will give you some ideas to get started in time-lapse video or photography and let's define what a time-lapse video and what makes them great.

## What is Time Lapse

Time-lapse is a creative filming and video editing technique that manipulates how the frame rate is captured. Frame rate is the number of images or frames appearing in a second of video. In most videos, the frame rate and playback speed are the same. In a time-lapse video, the frame rate is stretched out far more: when played back at average speed, time appears to be sped up.

Time-lapse can also refer to a camera's shutter speed (How long the camera's shutter remains open to let light in). A similar effect to time-lapse is found in stop-motion videos. The subject doesn't move but seems to be in motion because it's manually or repeatedly moved and then photographed. The images are then strung together to create video-like motion.

![time lapse car video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/time-lapse-car-video.jpg)

## How Time-lapse Works

Time-lapse photography is a technique that records a scene or objects that change at a slow speed and turns it into a video that plays back at high speed.

Most time-lapse videos are projected at a speed of 30 frames per second. The frame rate of your time-lapse video can be determined in the editing process, but you will need to account for how quickly the action is taking place in the camera or your video will be a collection if stills. Consider what FPS you want to use in your video. You need to capture that many frames per second to create a time-lapse effect. If you're shooting a 10 second video at 30fps, you should end up with 300 images.

What equipment needed for time-lapse video?

Time-lapse photography requires only a few special pieces of equipment.

**1\. Camera / Smartphones**

Technically any point and shoot camera or smartphone can be used for time-lapse video, the easiest ones to work are DSLR or mirrorless cameras, some even have an in camera intervalometer (often called a time-lapse feature or time-lapse mode), which means you'll need less equipment to take great time-lapse video.

**2\. High-capacity Memory Card**

For the best results, shoot in RAW format which takes image in the highest resolution with actual image dimensions. You'll need to prepare for very large RAW file sizes, so bring multiple high capacity memory cards.

**3.Tripod**

A tripod is essential to time-lapse video or photography, because the camera needs to stay perfectly still in order to emphasize the steady movement of your subject and to avoid overlay blurry videos or photos.

## How to Capture Times-lapse Video

A technique that was once found only in video editing software is now on nearly every mobile device. So what's the best way to make an amazing time-lapse video that stands apart from the rest? That depends on how you plan to capture the footage.

**Smartphones:**

Most phones have a time-lapse feature in their camera app. Be advised: you will need to record for an extended period, as 30 minutes equates to about 10 seconds of footage. Like a video camera, you will need a tripod to steady your shots. On an iPhone, you can either film a time-lapse or stitch one together from your photo collection, all without a video editor.

**DSLR Camera**

For DSLR camera you'll need a tripod and a device called intervalometer. The first is essential to make sure your camera is stationary and is taking photos if the exact same location without moving anywhere.

An intervalometer, or a remote control, is a device that allows you to set your camera to hit the shutter button at an interval of your choice. In other words, an intervalometer is there to let you rest aside without having a manually click the shutter button yourself.

**Here are some video ideas for your time-lapse**

* Ice melting
* Flower and plants
* Clouds moving
* Sunrise/sunset
* Star movement
* Traffic movement

**Ice melting**

Time-lapse is an ideal way to capture the mesmerizing transition between water and ice. Even something as simple as watching ice melt can be appealing.

**Flower and plants**

Flowers and plants can be beautiful to behold, but their transformation from seed to adult plant is often absolutely breathtaking. If you have an indoor plant that you are about to start growing you can set up a camera on a mount of a tripod at the angle with which you want to capture. As you water, groom or fertilize on a regular schedule, you can incorporate taking a photograph at the same time.

**Clouds moving**

The clouds can provide a whole host of phenomena that will both enlighten the observer to the complexities of the atmosphere or cosmos but will also provide a beautiful spectacle in the daytime, the movement of clouds can be quite spell binding and the rolling in of rain or a thunderstorm can be particularly interesting.

**Sunrise/Sunset**

Shooting a sunset is more difficult. The light changes during the selected time period.

To overcome this, use remote control camera software. This can be compensated by increasing the ISO or decreasing the shutter speed as the light dims.

![shoot sunset timelapse video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-sunset-timelapse-video.jpg)

**Star movement**

At night, if the sky is clear and you are in an area dark enough, the stars in the sky can provide a beautiful time-lapse as the stars move in relation to the observer due to earths rotations.

**Traffic movement**

The interconnectedness of vehicles moving along busy roads, trailing light patterns, and the general hustle and bustle of city life can be brought to you in a dynamic way via time-lapse videos.

It is the smooth impression of motion which time-lapse is able to produce that can emphasize and help to invigorate something as ordinary and everyday as the coming and going of traffic.

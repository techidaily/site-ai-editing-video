## Easy Guide to Zoom Video in VLC

Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.

You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.

## Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom

VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.

Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.

Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.

Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.

Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg)

Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg)

Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.

## Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu

Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.

Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.

Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-vlc-zoom-options.jpg)

Otherwise, you can press Shift + Z keys together to try out different zoom options.

## Part 3: Zoom VLC Video Using Magnifier

If you are using VLC Media Player on your Windows desktop computer, you can use the inbuilt Magnifier tool to zoom into a video that you are playing on VLC. You can zoom into videos to read any text in the background but this leads to low resolution and distortion. You can zoom in by 16 times which is the highest among all the three methods. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom video using Magnifier tool.

Step1Open VLC Player and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Start menu on Windows and search for “Magnifier”.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-vlc-video-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Click on Magnifier App. Once it opens, place the mouse pointer on the video and you will see its magnified version.

Step4Press Windows and “+” keys to zoom in while press Windows and “-“ keys to zoom out.

## Part 4: VLC Alternative to Zoom in Videos

You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.

**●** **Is this concept is going to work? -** A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.

**●** **Arranging Shots -** A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.

**●** **Saving Money -** Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.

**●** **Recognizing the mistakes -** On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.

**●** **Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -** When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.

### 04How to Label Storyboards?

If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.

For example: Panel\_7\_New\_New\_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name\_ Script#\_Scene\_Frame\_01.JPG

### 05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?

Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them "OTS 1" and "OTS 2" with the corresponding dialogues.

**Step 3: Create the First Slide**

The inaugural slide of your presentation is generally consists of the slideshow the title, which you can add by clicking on the ‘Title’ icon under the ‘Preview’ box, to see a variety of text customization choices appear within the editor workspace.

To work with adding titles to a slide, choose a preferred text style; followed by navigating to the ‘Events Pane’ and dropping the same within the first dotted frame box. You can edit the text in the blue box above the first frame. The amount of text you can add depends on the size of the box. To change the length of the box, click on the same to drag it to a desired place and finally include the text in the ‘Preview’ box.

Navigate to and hit the ‘Show Fonts’ button to customize the added text in terms of color, fonts, style and size. Tap the ‘Preview Slide’ button to see the applied changes and click on ‘Done’ to confirm the same. You can repeat the above process to add titles and informative banners to all the slides within the slideshow presentation that you are about to create.

**Step 3: Include Still Images**

Browse through the locally saved images within your device gallery and add the desired ones at a specific point in the editor timeline using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage. Do not close the image folder in your device until you have imported all the stills.

The images can be alternatively added to the timeline by selecting the required ones from the iOS device’s Photo Booth or iPhoto account. All you need to do is navigate to and hit the ‘Photo’ button to drop the selected images in the ‘Photos’ box at the bottom right corner of the software workspace.

![iMovie Slideshow Creator- Adding Images to the Presentation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-video-slideshow-in-imovie-3.JPG)

**Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions**

Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.

![iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-video-slideshow-in-imovie-4.JPG)

**●** **Video Adjustment Tool**

Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.

**●** **Crop Tool**

Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.

The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.

**●** **Clock Tool**

The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.

Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.

**Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio**

Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.

To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.

![iMovie Slideshow Creator- Adding Background Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-video-slideshow-in-imovie-5.JPG)

**Step 6: Share Your Presentation**

Run a mock slideshow in the ‘Preview’ box to ensure that every element of the presentation is at its specified place. When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.

## Part 3 In What Way Could You Edit Your Video Shortly?

Creating **slideshow iMovie** presentations is a creative task and everything comes on the line with the finesse of editing skills to evoke an intelligent play with features, tools and effects. While you can master the art with consistent effort and practice, there are some really cool tips and tricks to quickly edit and uplift iMovie presentations.

Let us have a look at a few of the most prominent ones in the following section before you move ahead to **create slideshow in iMovie**:

### 01Cool Ways to Quickly Edit Your iMovie Videos

**●** **Crop to Zoon in the Video**

When editing your videos in the iMovie software, you can zoom in a desired portion of the video frame. All you need to do is, select a clip, tap on the ‘Crop’ button at the top right corner over the ‘Preview’ box, choose the ‘Crop to Fill’ option and drag the effect to the specific clip area you wish to crop. Apply your changes by clicking inside the checkbox at the top right corner.

![iMovie Slideshow Creation Tips- Video ‘Crop and Zoom’ Feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-video-slideshow-in-imovie-6.JPG)

**●** **Split a Clip**

You can reduce the size of a sufficiently long video clip by choosing to break the same into several parts or trim it to ward off unwanted portions. To split your footage, take your cursor to the specific splitting point of the clip within the editor timeline, make a right click, and select the ‘Split Clip’ option from the dropdown menu that follows next.

**●** **Detach an Audio File**

Detaching audio from a clip allows you to experiment with different video play options. You can let the run the in the background as you proceed to split a clip for inserting a still image. To work with the effect, navigate to and right click on a desired clip within the editor timeline and tap on ‘Detach Audio’ in the upcoming list of options. The added music clip in ’Blue’ will detach to appear as an independent clip in ‘Green’ within the software timeline.

**●** **Fade Audio In and Out**

To ensure a smooth audio transition between successive clips, try hands at fading the audio in and out by pointing the cursor at a detached green or an attached blue audio clip, followed by dragging the small round circles at the beginning or end of the footage. To introduce a gradual fade in or out effect, drag the round button to the center of the video clip.

**●** **Include Transitions**

Transitions allow a seamless presentation flow by ensuring a smooth movement between different slides appearing in continuity. Add a suitable transition element to the video footage of your slideshow by navigating to and hitting the ‘Transition’ tab in the ‘Functions Toolbar’. The default transition screen time is 1 second, but you can customize the same by double clicking on the effect post the latter’s addition within the editor timeline.

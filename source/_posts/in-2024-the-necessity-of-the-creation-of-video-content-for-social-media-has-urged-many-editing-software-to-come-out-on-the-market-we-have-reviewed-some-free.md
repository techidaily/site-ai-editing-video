Before opting for a free video editing software there are many important things, we mostly miss that we should have known. But you don’t have to worry about it anymore let’s begin:

* **What are you planning to use it for**: You must know the purpose of video editing software before picking one. You could need a video editing tool for gaming or simply creating ordinary YouTube videos.
* **Learning curve**: You need to compare the editing software options that you have to determine which one is complex to learn and which one is easy. This will save you the time and effort you would have spent downloading multiple products to test.
* **Quality**: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, and you need to choose the one that supports your video format.
* **Resources**: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor with all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.
* **Compatability**: Check whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you want to use. Consult the internet for compatibility by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.

* **Quality**: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, and you need to choose the one that supports your video format.
* **Resources**: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor with all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.

02 [Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF](#Part 2)

03 [How to Make an Image Background Transparent](#Part 3)

04 [How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?

Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.

Using a transparent background as a brand promotion tool helps to project forward the major highlights of your product with a supportive background image, like the brand logo. This helps the audience to have a general idea of your brand. Apart from this, you can also assure the authenticity and quality of your brand by using a watermark in the background image.

Images with transparent backgrounds are the current promotion trends, owing to their convenient compatibility with any web design and the flexibility to mix with the most diverse color palettes and different elements on the product webpage. These can further be easily rendered in 3D to present realistic product images.

## Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF

Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.

It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.

### 01Compression

Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.

**JPG**

The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.

The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.

**PNG**

This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.

You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.

**GIF**

Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.

### 02Transparency

Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.

**JPG**

The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.

**PNG**

The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.

**GIF**

This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.

While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.

### 03Color

Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.

**JPG**

The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.

**PNG**

The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.

**GIF**

The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.

### 04Animation

Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.

A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?

Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.

Images with transparent backgrounds are the current promotion trends, owing to their convenient compatibility with any web design and the flexibility to mix with the most diverse color palettes and different elements on the product webpage. These can further be easily rendered in 3D to present realistic product images.

## Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF

Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.

It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.

### 01Compression

Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.

**JPG**

The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.

The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.

**PNG**

This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.

You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.

**GIF**

Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.

### 02Transparency

Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.

**JPG**

The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.

**PNG**

The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.

**GIF**

This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.

While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.

### 03Color

Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.

**JPG**

The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.

**PNG**

The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.

**GIF**

The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.

### 04Animation

Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.

A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.

Step 1

First off, download the [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). After it downloads, click install and follow the provided steps.

![download and install filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/download-and-install-filmora.png)

Step 2

After installing, the editor will start automatically. When it does, click on the **“New Project”** button to finally open the editor.

![filmora video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filmora-video-editor.png)

Step 3

From the upper-left side of the screen, click the highlighted text to import media. This is where you insert your video files into the editor. Once the folder opens, select the videos you want to import and click “**Open”.**

![import media and open](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/import-media-and-open.png)

Step 4

Drag your first clip to the timeline. Then, move the Playhead to where you want to start your transition.

![drag clip to timeline in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-clip-to-timeline-in-filmora.png)

Step 5

Take a snapshot of this frame.

![take snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/take-snapshot-in-filmora.png)

Step 6

Split the footage and delete the part on the right side of the Playhead.

![split footage in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/split-footage-in-filmora.png)

Step 7

Without moving the Playhead, simply drag the snapshot you took earlier. Right-click on the snapshot in the timeline and click on “**Duration”.** Then, set the duration to **1 second**. Finally, click “**OK**”.

![change snapshot duration filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-snapshot-duration-filmora.png)

Step 8

Open your browser and go to the [Picsart photo effects editor](https://picsart.com/photo-effects/photo-to-cartoon). Upload the same snapshot we made in Filmora and apply the “Comic” preset on it. Then, download the photo and import it back into Filmora.

![comic preset picsart](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/comic-preset-picsart.png)

Step 9

Drag the snapshot with the Comic preset to the Timeline and set its duration to 1 second as well.

Step 10

Repeat the same process with the second clip. Take a snapshot, add the Comic effect, and import it back into Filmora. But this time, align the clips as follows: Add the snapshot with the comic preset first, then the snapshot without any effects, and then the video. It should look like this.

![second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/second-clip.png)

Step 11

Go to the Transitions tab and drag the “Color Distance” transition between the first and second snapshot on your Timeline. Then, right-click on the transition box in the timeline and select “**Edit Properties**”. From there, change the duration of the transition to 1 second and click “**OK**”.

![transition in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/transition-in-filmora.png)

Step 12

Drag the “**Push**” transition between the next two snapshots. Set its duration to 1 second as well by right clicking the transition and going to “Edit Properties”.

![push transition in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/push-transition-in-filmora.png)

Step 13

Place the last transition between the last two snapshots in your timeline. This time, we’re going to use the “**Evaporate**” transition. Set its duration to 1 second as well.

![evaporate transition filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/evaporate-transition-filmora.png)

Step 14

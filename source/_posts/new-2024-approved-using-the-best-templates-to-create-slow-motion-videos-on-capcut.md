### Method 1\. Using the Normal Speed Option

The normal method in this **CapCut slow-mo edit** alternative uses playback speed. It involves a simple slider positioning and some enhancement options. Here is how to create a slow motion in the Filmora app using the standard approach:

**Step 1\.** After downloading the Filmora application, navigate towards the top tools. From there, select the “Speed” option and choose a clip for import.

![open app and access speed section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/best-templates-to-create-slow-motion-videos-on-capcut-12.jpg)

**Step 2\.** Select the “Normal” section and drag the playback towards the left. This will slow down the video, and you can set the speed up to 0.2x for slo-mo. After speed settings, click the “ü” icon, and if you want, do other settings.

**Step 1\.** Repeat the same process of importing the video and go to the “Curve” section. Select a pre-designed speed template if it fits your video. If not, go for the “Customize” template, and a panel will display.

## Conclusion

The usage of chroma keying has been increasingly popular in recent years, with various uses of this video effect employed for live streaming. Chroma keying is used to erase the backdrop of a video clip which is then composited over another scene or picture. The most apparent usage of this technology is for weather broadcasts when the presenter is composited over the top of a weather radar picture. In more recent times we’re seeing video game broadcasters chroma keying themselves into their live feeds. There are various sites to explore for streaming backdrops. Most come as overlay packages with distinct themes. A good location to look is Filmora. Else, if you want to add a new backdrop to your broadcast, you may simply add a new picture source to your scene in OBS. So, check out what best fits you and opt for the one.

### Method 2: Change Aspect Ratio under Project Settings

You can change the aspect ratio by clicking on the "Project Settings." You can decide the target aspect ratio based on the aspect ratio of the media source.

For instance, if the aspect ratio of media source files is 4:3, select the standard aspect ratio of 4:3\. Then, media files with other aspect ratios will show black bars.

In case of any discordance or if you want to change the aspect ratio, choose the proper ratio from project settings.

If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the **Proportiona**l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

Preparation is a must especially if you have multiple videos on your computer. A good tip would be renaming them by the sequence you plan to have. And, you could also place them in folders to avoid repetition and double copies. Once you’re done, you can drag and drop your video or

click the **Import.**

Go ahead and select the video clip that you want to crop. Then, click the **Crop** tool and choose if you want the **Crop** or **Pan & Zoom.** Yes, you have options on what kind of crop you want it to be.

An alternative way is by right clicking the video clip .Under the **Video** tab you can select the **Crop and Zoom** or **Crop to Fit** then adjust to your preferred ratio.

You can review the cropped video to think through if this is the portion that you want to be included. Unlike other applications, you can go back and adjust it to your liking.

If you’re finally satisfied then you can export it. Choose the output format and you can also rename the file. Clicking the settings button will offer you additional options of your video output.

After all that, you have the cropped video that you can either upload or repurpose in another content. Did you enjoy the process of cropping it in Wondershare Filmora?

Remember, that you have the option to batch crop multiple video clips on this so no need to manually crop and export it. You can see the big picture and monitor if the flow makes sense to you.

## The Bottom Line

You are once again done with the process of checking out these two applications. After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs. The interface also could change your mind depending if you want simplicity or a challenge. Price is also a factor that can affect your willingness to use these applications. But, this guide clearly shows you that it is worth paying for.

For those who wish to refine the effect further, Filmora offers adjustment tools, allowing you to tweak the intensity, hue, and other parameters of the filter, ensuring your video looks just the way you envisioned.

## Part 3: Summary

Giving your videos a vintage VHS look has never been easier. With the availability of free resources online and built-in presets in editing software like Filmora, you're only a few clicks away from transporting your audience back to the 90s.

Whether for aesthetic or nostalgic reasons, the VHS effect is a fun way to spice up your videos. So, grab your camcorder (or smartphone) and start filming!

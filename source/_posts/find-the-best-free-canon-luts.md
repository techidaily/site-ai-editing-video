## Step by Step to Rotate Videos Using Kdenlive

It supports all of the major video formats and has a wide range of features. Kdenlive is available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Kdenlive is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful, yet easy-to-use video editor.

The clip monitor shows your video as it will appear in your final project. The effects stack allows you to apply a range of video effects to your clips.

## Step-by-step on how to rotate videos using Kdenlive

There are two ways to rotate videos using Kdenlive: by using the rotate filter or by changing the project settings. The rotate filter is a video effect that allows you to rotate your video clip around its vertical and horizontal axes. To apply the rotate filter...

Step 1: Import your video clip to the timeline.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-1.png)

Step 2: Open the Effects tab and expand the Transform, Distort Perspective tab.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-2.png)

Step 3: Drag the Rotate filter onto your clip.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-3.png)

Step 4: The Rotate filter will open in the Effects Editor.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-4.png)

Step 5: Use the sliders to rotate your video clip.

Step 6: Click the ‘Save’ Icon to apply the filter.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-5.png)

The rotate filter is a great way to quickly rotate your video clip. However, it does have some limitations. For example, you can't...

\- use the rotate filter on clips that are already rotated

\- use the rotate filter to create a 360-degree rotation

\- change the rotation orientation of your clip.

If you need to rotate your video clip in a different direction, or if you want to create a 360-degree rotation, you can change the project settings.

## Motion Tracking Is the Process of Tracking the Movements of a Project in a Video. This Article Will Show You How to Apply Motion Tracking Effect Into Videos

Motion tracking makes it easier to follow the movement of objects and provide the sensed data to a program for additional processing. Motion tracking involves recording an object's movements that match a previously stored motion template. This has a wide range of uses, including in robotics, entertainment, sports, the military, and the entertainment industry. Additionally, it is utilized in the creation of video games and films. While motion tracking is frequently referred to as match movement in the film and video game industries, motion tracking is frequently referred to as motion capture in other contexts.

With that said, let's begin!

1. [Filmora](#part2-1)
2. [Blender](#part2-2)
3. [DaVinci Resolve](#part2-3)
4. [Kdenlive](#part2-4)
5. [HitFilm Express](#part2-5)
6. [VEGAS Pro](#part2-6)
7. [Adobe Premiere Pro](#part2-7)
8. [PowerDirector](#part2-8)

* [Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?](#part3)

## Part 1\. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking

We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let's quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,

Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion  
Add text or solids as additional compositional elements  
Add 3D elements to 2D footage  
Use effects or color gradation methods  
Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television

These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.

## Part 2\. What software do you need?

There are numerous options for motion tracking applications. With advantages and downsides, we've compiled a list of the finest motion tracking programs. The following are the best video editors for motion tracking in our opinion:

### Filmora

Wondershare created [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to enable you to fully express your creativity. FilmoraPro is the best option if you want to make some high-level modifications to your video. In addition to the pre-sets offered, it allows you to tweak the effects for a more expertly edited appearance.

![filmorapro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/MotionTracking1.png)

Motion tracking is currently its best feature. You may track a skater as they race across the ice or follow a boat as it travels. Use the motion tracking feature to add drama to your videos. You won't have to worry about getting lost because FilmoraPro features an amazingly simple UI. Simply click on the person or object you wish to track and choose Motion Track from the Effects menu.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Blender

Open-source and cost-free motion tracking software is called Blender. It's an excellent 3D creating tool. Modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing, 2D animation, and of course motion tracking is all supported.

![blender video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-video-editing.jpg)

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

![kdenlive adjust slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kdenlive-adjust-slider.jpg)

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

![hitfilm express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hitfilm-express.jpg)

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.

Part 1\. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking

We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let's quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,

Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion  
Add text or solids as additional compositional elements  
Add 3D elements to 2D footage  
Use effects or color gradation methods  
Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television

These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.

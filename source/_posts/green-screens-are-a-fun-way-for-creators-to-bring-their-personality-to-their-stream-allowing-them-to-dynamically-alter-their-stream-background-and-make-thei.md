## Green Screens Are a Fun Way for Creators to Bring Their Personality to Their Stream, Allowing Them to Dynamically Alter Their Stream Background and Make Their Content Appear Even More Engaging and Polished

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished. With Twitch green screen background, you can easily configure Chroma key settings and detect your green screen with a single click.

The twitch green screen attaches directly to the back of your chair. You don't have to worry about stands, or spacing behind your chair. Just attach it and go. This portable green screen can fit on the back of your chair a feature that makes it easy to assemble and use for start-up twitchers.

## How to set up a Green Screen with Twitch Studio

****Set Up Your Camera**

First things first, make sure that your camera is being detected on Twitch Studio. If you do not already have a layer with your webcam on your scene, click Edit Scene and add a webcam layer by clicking the + icon on the left next to Layers.

Once your webcam layer has been created, make sure that the desired device is selected, plugged in, and that you have not turned off every webcam (Camera icon on the bottom left of Twitch Studio).

****Set Up Your Green Screen**

Once your green screen is set up in your background, select your webcam layers to display your webcam settings.

We recommend using the Auto-Detect Color feature as it will automatically detect the best color code for you and will be a great base to work from. If you prefer, you can manually pick the color code by either providing the color code in the Color to Remove field or clicking on the colored square to display a color spectrum that you can select from.

The Chroma Key section is located at the bottom of the webcam settings, and you will be able to toggle the chroma key on and off by clicking the eye icon.

To adjust the chroma key settings, you can click on Edit Chroma Key. You will be able to change the color code and change similarity, edge transparency and color correction for the perfect fit.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

## How to Zoom in on PowerPoint [Easy Ways]

How often have you wished you could zoom in to more fully illustrate a point on a slide during a PowerPoint presentation? If you use PowerPoint for Windows and are a subscription to Microsoft 365, you have access to that function! There is a lot going on in some Microsoft PowerPoint presentations. It may include a lot of little details or significant information like PowerPoint slide zoom, and altering it would be impractical. If this occurs, you may make a zoom shape and utilize the expand animation to focus on the information you're describing in more depth. By doing this, you can maintain the overall picture while concentrating on the key points of the talk.

You are giving a presentation at a meeting and have a number of possibilities. Zoom in PowerPoint Presentation enables you to create an introduction slide that includes thumbnails for the slides you wish to skip to in any order to discuss those choices throughout your meeting. It builds a navigable interactive dashboard for your presentation. When you leave the opening slide and go through all the slides in a part, you are immediately returned to the beginning. So where does PowerPoint's magic reside? PowerPoint The most recent addition to the lengthy and ever-expanding list of new functions is Zoom. Zoom is incredible since it effectively turns a slide or many slides from your project into a changeable hotspot. A hotspot is a clickable item that connects to a certain area, in case you forgot. You will thus be directed to that slide if you choose it as a hotspot when you click on the item.

## Part 1: 3 Techniques to Zoom PowerPoint Presentations

Microsoft is always developing new tools to help you create and construct amazing presentations. The PowerPoint Zoom function is one of them. It is not the straightforward zoom capability that has been a part of PowerPoint for a long time. Zoom in PowerPoint is a useful feature that enables you to go right to the information you want and promotes an interactive presentation that is seamless. You just need to be aware of three distinct sorts of Zooms to do it quickly and easily. They are described below:

### 1\. Use the View tab Zoom command

PowerPoint's Zoom feature is a clever tool for creating and watching presentations. When the text or item you wish to deal with is too tiny for you to view, the Zoom tool might be useful. On the screen, a slide will look bigger as you zoom in, and smaller when you zoom away. Choose the appropriate zoom level in the "Zoom" dialog box by typing a number into the "Percent:" spinner or selecting an option from the "Zoom to" section. Click the "OK" button to apply the chosen magnification level after setting it.

##### Step1Zoom in with the View Dialog Box

Additionally, you may access the Zoom dialog box and choose a different zoom level by clicking the Zoom button on the View tab of the ribbon. choose the Ribbon's "View" tab. the "Zoom" button from the "Zoom" button group, and then.

![how to zoom in on powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-view-zoom-in-powerpoint.jpg)

##### Step2Click the Zoom Button

Zoom in by going to the View tab attributes. Select Zoom in from the View menu after clicking. There will be a Zoom window where you may choose or input the zoom level. More options for adjusting the zoom level are available under the Zoom group on the View tab of the ribbon.

![how to zoom in on powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-zoom-button-powerpoint.jpg)

##### Step3Click Fit to Window

Additionally, if you choose Fit, Presentation will resize the window to a proper size.

![how to zoom in on powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-to-fit-powerpoint.jpg)

### 2\. Use the Zoom Slider at The Bottom of the Screen

In PowerPoint, the Status Bar's lower-right application window has the Zoom slider. This tool lets you adjust the slide's magnification level. This just modifies your sense of how near or far away the slide looks onscreen; the slide itself is unaffected in any way.

##### Step1Click the Zoom In (+) button on the status bar

The horizontal scroll bar will then display underneath the slide if you zoom in on the slide until it can no longer fit horizontally on the screen. The slide may then be thoroughly examined at the selected magnification level by using it to scroll left and right.

![how to zoom in on powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjust-zoom-status-bar.jpg)

##### Step2Click the Zoom Out (-) button on the status bar

Changing the magnification level is simple using PowerPoint's Zoom slider. Click and move the slider left, toward the minus sign, to reduce the magnification level. To the left of the zoom slider is a percentage that represents the magnification level.

##### Step3Fit to the Window

Click the "Fit slide to current window" button to the right of the Zoom slider to force the slide to fit inside the view's available slide area.

![how to zoom in on powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fit-slide-to-current-window.jpg)

### 3\. The Ctrl + Mouse Spin Wheel Shortcut

Ctrl + scroll wheel is a typical shortcut for zooming in Windows. Open the worksheet or presentation you wish to save with the desired zoom level, then complete the procedures listed below:

Step1Launch PowerPoint on your Windows computer and go to the slide of the presentation you want to zoom in or out on.

Step2To zoom in on a slide in PowerPoint, just hold the CTRL key on your keyboard while spinning your mouse wheel in an upwards direction.

![how to zoom in on powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mouse-spin-wheel-shortcut.jpg)

Step3In a similar manner, to zoom out on your presentation, hold down the CTRL key on your computer while dragging the mouse wheel downward as seen below.

![how to zoom in on powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-mouse-wheel-downward.jpg)

After that, you will be able to get the desired value to Zoom in or out on your PowerPoint presentation.

## Conclusion

Are you prepared to use the new PowerPoint zoom feature in Microsoft Office to bring your presentation to life? To comprehend it, you must first view the aforementioned ways. A zoom bar or zoom slider may be used in Microsoft Office programs, such as PowerPoint, to rapidly and efficiently zoom in and out of documents. The zoom slider should look like the image on this page and is often in the bottom right corner of the program window. You will continue with the presentation when you have finished the zoom. This implies that you will be able to skip through undesired slides and material.

## Part 1: 3 Techniques to Zoom PowerPoint Presentations

Microsoft is always developing new tools to help you create and construct amazing presentations. The PowerPoint Zoom function is one of them. It is not the straightforward zoom capability that has been a part of PowerPoint for a long time. Zoom in PowerPoint is a useful feature that enables you to go right to the information you want and promotes an interactive presentation that is seamless. You just need to be aware of three distinct sorts of Zooms to do it quickly and easily. They are described below:

### 1\. Use the View tab Zoom command

PowerPoint's Zoom feature is a clever tool for creating and watching presentations. When the text or item you wish to deal with is too tiny for you to view, the Zoom tool might be useful. On the screen, a slide will look bigger as you zoom in, and smaller when you zoom away. Choose the appropriate zoom level in the "Zoom" dialog box by typing a number into the "Percent:" spinner or selecting an option from the "Zoom to" section. Click the "OK" button to apply the chosen magnification level after setting it.

##### Step1Zoom in with the View Dialog Box

Additionally, you may access the Zoom dialog box and choose a different zoom level by clicking the Zoom button on the View tab of the ribbon. choose the Ribbon's "View" tab. the "Zoom" button from the "Zoom" button group, and then.

##### Step2Click the Zoom Button

Zoom in by going to the View tab attributes. Select Zoom in from the View menu after clicking. There will be a Zoom window where you may choose or input the zoom level. More options for adjusting the zoom level are available under the Zoom group on the View tab of the ribbon.

### 2\. Use the Zoom Slider at The Bottom of the Screen

In PowerPoint, the Status Bar's lower-right application window has the Zoom slider. This tool lets you adjust the slide's magnification level. This just modifies your sense of how near or far away the slide looks onscreen; the slide itself is unaffected in any way.

##### Step1Click the Zoom In (+) button on the status bar

The horizontal scroll bar will then display underneath the slide if you zoom in on the slide until it can no longer fit horizontally on the screen. The slide may then be thoroughly examined at the selected magnification level by using it to scroll left and right.

##### Step2Click the Zoom Out (-) button on the status bar

Changing the magnification level is simple using PowerPoint's Zoom slider. Click and move the slider left, toward the minus sign, to reduce the magnification level. To the left of the zoom slider is a percentage that represents the magnification level.

## 4 Solutions to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-8.png)

**Step 5**: Click "Add". You can load one or more video files. Here, I'll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click "Convert / Save" again.

**Step 8**: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.

Eyeball the color and choose a match closest to the color you want, but this method is likely to match existing paint in a noticeable area. In addition, it is a perfectly acceptable option when you want to choose a closer color.

The app will get you the closest cousin, and more so you can preview recommended accent color and design from the comfort of your home.

Alternatively, you can take a picture with your phone in natural light without using a caller app and take the photo to your favorite paint store.

if you want to match a pale yellow, bright blue, or stormy sky grey furniture or wall. All you need is to head to your favorite paint store and gather up a selection of paint chips close to the hue you are trying to match. After that, bring the trip home and hang them on the surface which color you want to duplicate, then observe multiple lights using lamp light and daylight, whichever chip matches most closely.

The **freeze-frame video editing** effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.

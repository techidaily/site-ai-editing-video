## Part 4: How to blur Zoom background on Android

Additionally, Zoom blur backdrops are the ideal option for first video conversations with clients, coworkers, or supervisors. On its Android app, Zoom offers customers the option to blur their backdrop. However, there is a catch: the function can only be activated once the user has entered a meeting. If a virtual backdrop isn't your style on Android, you may choose to blur the background instead. Everything in the backdrop will be blurred, keeping just your picture apparent throughout the conversation. Remember that all of your next meetings will have the blur function turned on. How? Read on.

Step1Only while you're in a meeting can you alter your backdrop. Tap the More icon in the bottom right corner after joining one.

Step3The backdrop of a picture or video added from your gallery using the Add icon will likewise successfully blur the background on your Zoom Android device. Now place Zoom calls as usual, and the backdrop of your live video will be automatically blurred.

## Conclusion

For individuals who prefer to obscure their surroundings while on a video conversation, Zoom's blur background function is helpful. The function was added to the video-conferencing app in 2021 and has since gained popularity. The greatest thing you can do is choose a blur out backdrop if you can't determine which of our Zoom background categories would best fit the video chat occasion. These are impartial backdrops that don't necessarily depict any particular environment. They only provide a lovely, unobtrusive background that will take away any possible obstructions during the video connection. Perhaps a professional setting might be too much for a particular video chat, whilst a humorous backdrop wouldn't work. In this situation, a blurred picture backdrop will be the difference between putting little to no effort into your call and being ready to portray yourself in the best possible way.

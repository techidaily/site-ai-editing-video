When recording someone else's discussion, be sure you have their permission. We'll show you how to record discord audio with the **Craig Discord bot** and record discord audio using Craig in this article. Craig can record discord calls also. Let's get started!

Craig will record continuously for up to six hours. You can download a copy of the audio to examine the status of a recording until you download the file. The Craig website has a complete set of **Craig bot commands**, which you may immediately access by typing: Craig, help in a Discord channel.

## Part 2 Is Craig Discord Bot Safe?

## Part 3 How Do I Enable Craig in Discord?

## Part 2: Key Features of LumaFusion Video Editor

We will now highlight some essential features that can be considered about the **LumaFusion video editor**. These features will give a better understanding of the tool and provide a guideline on how to utilize the best functions with ease:

### 1\. Interface

When understanding the interface of **the LumaFusion app** on iOS, many would think the application won't provide extensive tools to work with. This video editor does not come with a bland user interface but provides some great functions and features on an interface that allows you to create professional-level videos.

With the option of adding titles, transitions, color grading, and effects, LumaFusion is a complete video editor that provides features that are not commonly observed in many desktop-based video editors. Regardless, it presents an efficient workspace that has managed all the functions properly in rows and different sections.

![lumafusion video editor interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-2.jpg)

### 2\. Video’s Layers

Creating proper movies on your iOS device is not difficult with LumaFusion. With the option of including six layers of video in the timeline, a lot can be done with them for improvising different sequences and multiple effects. Its picture-in-picture presets, layered transitions, graphic equalizer, and the use of additional plugins allow you to create complete videos with proper control.

Talking about some renowned iOS video editors in the market, you will find **LumaFusion** a much better option. iMovie, the dedicated video editor for iOS devices, can only embed two layers of videos in the timeline. This clearly explains why LumaFusion is a much better option with its video layers.

![video layers in lumafusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/lumafusion-video-editor-3.jpg)

### 3\. Powerful Keyframe

Users who are having a rough time editing the file on LumaFusion can easily shift to Final Cut Pro.

This process has disadvantages, regardless of the extensive control and accessibility provided between the applications. If you seek to use Final Cut Pro after editing a video on the **LumaFusion app**, you will have to add all the assets on FCP when you shift the file onto the platform.

With the option of adding titles, transitions, color grading, and effects, LumaFusion is a complete video editor that provides features that are not commonly observed in many desktop-based video editors. Regardless, it presents an efficient workspace that has managed all the functions properly in rows and different sections.

### 2\. Video’s Layers

Creating proper movies on your iOS device is not difficult with LumaFusion. With the option of including six layers of video in the timeline, a lot can be done with them for improvising different sequences and multiple effects. Its picture-in-picture presets, layered transitions, graphic equalizer, and the use of additional plugins allow you to create complete videos with proper control.

Talking about some renowned iOS video editors in the market, you will find **LumaFusion** a much better option. iMovie, the dedicated video editor for iOS devices, can only embed two layers of videos in the timeline. This clearly explains why LumaFusion is a much better option with its video layers.

### 3\. Powerful Keyframe

The keyframes function on LumaFusion is not challenging to work with on the video editor. You can ecstatically create animating effects with the help of the keyframe sounds within the application. These effects, once created, can be saved and used on other videos within the platform. To improve your effects on the mobile video editor, you can use the powerful keyframe feature of LumaFusion to create the best results.

With a small price to pay for the video editor, you can gain access to a diversity of keyframes that can help you design the perfect effects for your video.

### 4\. Export to Final Cut Pro

Another impressive and touching feature this video editor provides to its users is its integration with Final Cut Pro - a proficient desktop video editor offered on macOS. You can easily export your created video to Final Cut Pro as an FCPXML.zip file directly after paying a one-time price. Users who are having a rough time editing the file on LumaFusion can easily shift to Final Cut Pro.

This process has disadvantages, regardless of the extensive control and accessibility provided between the applications. If you seek to use Final Cut Pro after editing a video on the **LumaFusion app**, you will have to add all the assets on FCP when you shift the file onto the platform.

Also, you might have to include many effects such as LUTs, Chroma key, and other relevant features. With this effort, you can easily put your video from LumaFusion to Final Cut Pro.

## Part 5\. TS VS. MP4: What's the Difference?

What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:

### TS

TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.

### MP4

MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the '.ts' extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.

A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.

Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.

### Drawbacks of TS File Format

Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.

Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.

* [How to change the background of green screen image](#part2)

## Part 1\. How to put a background on a green screen to video?

The first thing you need to do is shoot your video with high-quality green screen in the background. Make sure that it is evenly spread and lit up so that there are no light and dark patches. Now that you have green screen video, you will need a professional video editor to replace the green screen with any background as per your requirements. Here are the three ways on how to add background to green screen.

### Way 1\. Use Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the easiest video editor to add a background to green screen video instantly. Filmora is a professional video editor with an intuitive user interface. There are loads of tools to add visual effects and perform basic to advanced editing. Filmora is available for Windows and Mac users and you have to transfer your recorded green screen video to your computer. You can replace green screen with a video as well as photo as per your preference. Here are the steps to put a background on green screen video using Filmora.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Download and install [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Launch the application and click on New Project. You should have the green screen video as well as the background replacement video or photo ready with which you want to replace green screen background.

Step2 Import your green screen video as well as the background video or photo under Project Media folder. Drag and drop both of them to Timeline. Make sure the green screen video is on top of the replacement background video or photo.

![import green screen video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-chroma-key-remove-selected-color.jpg)

Step3 Double-click on the video clip that you have dropped on Timeline. Go to Video tab and turn on Chroma Key option.

![click on export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/overview-export-win-3.png)

### Way 2\. Use iMovie

iMovie is one of the most preferred video editors among Mac and iPhone users. This is because the app comes from Apple, and there are ample features to enhance your video content and quality with effects. Adding a background to a green screen video using iMovie is quite easy. But replacing a background of a video without green screen is rather tough.

Step1 Launch iMovie from Applications folder on your Mac as it comes pre-installed.

Step2 Import your green screen video as well as replacement background video or photo to Project Media folder.

Step3 Drag and drop them into Timeline and place the green screen video above the replacement background video/photo. Make sure that the duration of both videos is the same.

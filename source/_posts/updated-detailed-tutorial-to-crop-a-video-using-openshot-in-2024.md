Slideshows are very popular, but they can sometimes seem a little boring. If you want to add something new, looping your slideshow will make all the difference. Adding music is easy in PowerPoint. A slideshow loop can be an effective way to keep viewers' attention, making it an effective tool for presentation. You can renovate your outdated slideshows video with Filmora.

With its loop function, Filmora enables you to incorporate interesting dynamic effects into your videos. So what does it take to set up a PowerPoint loop video? You don't need a lot of special programs or plugins to make your videos get looped on your presentations. Follow the above simple steps and you'll have your videos getting looped in no time.

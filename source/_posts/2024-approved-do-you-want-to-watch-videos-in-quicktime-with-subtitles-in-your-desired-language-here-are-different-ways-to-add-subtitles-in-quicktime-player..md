## Do You Want to Watch Videos in QuickTime with Subtitles in Your Desired Language? Here Are Different Ways to Add Subtitles in QuickTime Player

QuickTime is among the most popular multimedia players available for PC users. Developed by Apple Inc. in 1991, it was initially made available for Mac OS. However, from 2005 till 2016, QuickTime was available for Windows operating systems as well. While QuickTime allows you to view images and music, it is a popular choice for playing videos.

Do you use QuickTime player to watch music videos, movies, and TV shows? Well, you may find it interesting that the QuickTime player allows you to add subtitles. As there are multiple methods through which you can add subtitles in QuickTime, we are going to discuss them one by one in this blog. So, let’s start our discussion!

## Method 1: Turn on the Subtitles in QuickTime

As you might know, some videos come with embedded subtitles. It’s up to you whether you want to view them while playing the video or not. If you are playing a video with embedded subtitles in the QuickTime player but are somehow unable to view the subtitles, it’s probably because the subtitles feature is turned off. So, you need to enable the subtitles by following certain steps.

### Steps to Turn on Subtitles in QuickTime

Step1 Open the QuickTime Player application on your Mac computer.

![open quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/turn-on-subtitles-in-quicktime-1.png)

Step2 Play the video having subtitles embedded in it.

Step3 Within the menu bar, find the “view” tab and open it.

![find and open view tab in quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/turn-on-subtitles-in-quicktime-2.png)

Step4 Now, you need to find the subtitles option.

![find and access subtitles option in quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/turn-on-subtitles-in-quicktime-3.png)

Step5 Choose a language in which subtitles are available.

Step6 You will be able to view the subtitles at the bottom of the player window.

Step7 You can also click the “subtitles” button in the playback controls to view the subtitles available with a video.

## Method 2: Download and Add Subtitles to Videos in QuickTime

If you want to play videos in QuickTime that do not have embedded subtitles, you can add subtitles to them manually. With QuickTime player, it is quite easy to add external subtitles files and watch movies and TV shows with subtitles of your choice. However, you first need to download an appropriate subtitles file for a video from a reliable website and then load it onto the QuickTime player.

While downloading subtitles for the QuickTime player, keep in mind that you need subtitles in .QT file format.

### Steps to Add Subtitles to QuickTime Player

Step1 Download the subtitles for the video in the .QT format.

Step2 Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the subtitles file.

Step3 Right-click the file and select the “Open with QuickTime” option.

Step4 You will be able to see the subtitles. Select all the subtitles, right-click and select “Copy”.

Step5 Now, open the video in the QuickTime player.

Step6 In the menu bar, click “Edit” and then “Add to Movie”.

Step7 Paste the subtitles that you have copied earlier and click the “Save” button.

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

#### In this article

01 [What Is Color Distortion](#part1)

02 [How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?](#part2)

03 [Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos](#part3)

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

### Method 1: Correct Color Distortion in Videos Using Filmora

Filmora is user-friendly software with powerful tools that allow users to tweak the color settings and correct color distortion. Follow the steps below to learn how to correct color distortion in videos using Filmora.

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

### Method 1: Correct Color Distortion in Videos Using Filmora

Filmora is user-friendly software with powerful tools that allow users to tweak the color settings and correct color distortion. Follow the steps below to learn how to correct color distortion in videos using Filmora.

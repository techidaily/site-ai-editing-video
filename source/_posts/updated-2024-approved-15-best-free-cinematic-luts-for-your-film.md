* In Premiere, there are several possible transitions, and some can be more suitable for your project than others.

### Add Visual Effects

The Essential Graphics panel was added by Adobe to Premiere Pro. Users now have a much different workflow than they had with the few prior title panels. Now that everything is in one panel, you can easily create, animate, and use VFX. Some of the VFX shots were just building miniature towns and adding pieces, while others involved the standard green screen removal and backdrop replacement.

* Simply importing and uploading your video and audio files into Premiere Pro is the first step. The procedure of clicking through is fairly simple. Choose "New Project." Press the Media Browser panel button and find the Ultra Key tool by opening the Effects panel.

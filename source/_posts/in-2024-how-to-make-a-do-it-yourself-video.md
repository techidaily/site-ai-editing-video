## How To Make A Do-It-Yourself Video

Wondering how YouTubers make their own video from scratch? Want to open a YouTube channel and you don’t know how to start? Then, in this article; I’ll explain you the details. Please stay with me.

If you love to speak in front of the camera as if anyone is watching you, and if you’re someone with low self-esteem like me, and you want to develop your self-confidence, then you’re on the right track. People nowadays look for something that can add spice to their life like vlogging. But first, you need to know the reasons why you're opening a YouTube channel in the first place. Have a me time and ask yourself what do you want to share with your target audiences.

Things that can be of great influence to someone who badly needed it (in a positive way of course.) People nowadays search answers to their questions on YouTube. It is the second largest search engine next to Google and because of the YouTubers who give fuel to it, people around the globe watch it on a daily basis, I’m sure of it.

And now that you’ve already know what you want to share outside the world, you just need your vlogging equipment's.

2. [People Access Video Everywhere](#part2-2)
3. [You Don’t Need a Fortune to Produce Videos](#part2-3)

* [Preparations for a Vlog](#part3)

## Part 1\. Things That You Need when You Want to Start Vlogging

A smart phone and a tripod will do. You don’t need to have all those professional vlogging equipment's if you’re a new YouTuber. Each and every smart phone now can record a high-definition resolution. I started with my Samsung S6 and a pile of books as my tripod. Silly me! But you need to be resourceful. As the time went by, I bought a tripod from JOOM (an online store just like Ali Express). Very cheap and it last long. You also need a video editor for post editing. You don’t want to upload a raw video on YouTube without anything in it. It will be dull and boring.

## Part 2\. Reasons Why You Need a Video Editor?

### 1\. Videos Are Impactful

While pictures can tell a thousand words, video tells a thousand more. On your videos, your audiences can see your feelings about a particular topic, and with the correct techniques and editing secrets, you can effectively tell someone or many people a message you want to get across. Whether it is a message on how to make a do-it-yourself video or what is the best video editor for beginners?

### 2\. People Access Video Everywhere

You are probably one who does too. In this modern era of technology, you see people watching videos not only on television or the computer but on their laptops, tablets and smart phones as well. So, if you want something across, putting out your message or promotion through a video to these people makes sense. And it does not have to be that hard. You might say people only want to watch good looking videos. Well, yes, but using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video editing software can let your video look more professional.

### 3\. You Don’t Need a Fortune to Produce Videos

That's right. If you have a video editor installed on your phone, you’re ready to go. I started to edit my first ever video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) go. It’s very handy and easy to use for a beginner like me before. And it has lot of features that you can put in your video, like cool titles, transitions and even stickers. If you want to produce your video using your computer or a laptop, you can definitely use Wondershare Filmora. You probably will not be able to edit and produce “Hollywood” videos but with a decent computer or laptop and correct editing techniques, you can make pretty professional looking videos. I always recommend using Wondershare Filmora even if you’re a beginner. If you learn how to use Wondershare Filmora well, you can make videos compared to everyone else. I guarantee you that.

## Part 3\. Preparations for a Vlog

I take down notes when preparing a video, I used to write the things that I need to say. Things that I mostly want to highlight when expressing my thoughts to everyone who will watch it.

![do it yourself video prepare](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/do-it-yourself-video-prepare.jpg)

I put myself a little make up on when producing a video, it makes me feel more confident to speak in front of my virtual audiences because I know that I looked presentable in any way.

Now we need to set our do-it-yourself like studio (it can be your room; it can be in the living room or anywhere that you can see that has a good background) or you can use a green backdrop and just make wonders in the post editing.

![how to make a do it yourself video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-make-a-do-it-yourself-video.jpg)

During these days, I’m filming using my Canon GX7 Mark II and it’s a result of my first ever YouTube salary. When you’re into vlogging, at some point you need to upgrade your vlogging equipment's. I know it will take time, but you can do it.

After you finished a vlog/video, you need to edit it and that’s the most exciting part for me, at least. Put your teaser, your intro, the body of the video itself and don’t forget the outro.

![do it yourself video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/do-it-yourself-video-editing.jpg)

## Conclusions

If you want to open up a YouTube Channel, then do it now. Maybe you’ll feel down because people around you will not support you from the beginning and that’s the cruel part of being a YouTuber. As the saying goes by, “birds of the same feather, flock together”; people with the same passion as you can understand all your endeavors. Don’t always think of the money that you will receive afterwards because that brings pressure and you’ll push yourself to the limit until you’ll feel and say “enough is enough”. Just do your own thing and the rest will follow. And if you think that you have something to offer to someone out there virtually, then don’t think twice. We only live once, make the most out of it.

And if you’re looking for the best video editor for Personal Computers this year 2022, choose [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and you’ll be thrilled. Trust me, I’ve been there. Happy editing!

## Why Is It Necessary to Remove Audio from a Video?

You can make a video far more versatile and successful for many different things by removing the audio.

### Your Video Becomes Multipurpose

Taking the audio out of a video makes it more versatile. Presentations, slide decks, and instructional videos may all benefit from this. The original audio or background noise might be too distracting in such videos.

### No Language Issues

The muted or removed audio lets you reach viewers who speak a different language. By removing the original audio, the video becomes language-neutral. Thus, you save time adding subtitles or dubbing without disturbing the narration.

### Place Emphasis on the Video Itself

Cutting off the sound may make the video's visuals the main attraction. It may be beneficial when creating tutorials or instructional videos. That's because viewers may prefer to see the demos without the sound.

### Eliminating Excessive Background Noise

The video might get dull with background noises, echoes, or unwanted sounds. Deleting the audio stream helps to eliminate distractions. As a result, viewers get a cleaner viewing experience.

### Keeping Copyright Concerns at Bay

Businesses can avoid copyright infringement problems by eliminating audio from videos. Removing someone's audio work before using it in public venues is necessary. It supports copyright laws on audio material by limiting display to visual components.

### Content Personalization

Creators can let viewers add their soundtracks or voiceovers by removing audio. Thus, it can make the watching experience more customized. It suits projects that need a high degree of personalization or user-generated content.

### Confidential Data Security

Sometimes, a video might capture sensitive conversations or information. So, it's essential to **remove the audio** to protect privacy. Remember, sharing the visual footage does not compromise confidentiality. It hides the crucial discussions or data from the original audio.

As you can see, removing audio from a video has several benefits. Many options are available when you mute the audio in a video. By eliminating background noise, you're freeing your imagination.

So, how do silent videos improve your video production strategies? Let's find out!

## How Can You Improve Storytelling With Silent Videos?

There is a much unrealized narrative potential in silent videos. Most videos rely only on visual elements to convey narratives. Thus, mute clips have a unique ability to captivate audiences. It also offers many possibilities for storytelling, allowing for a more immersive experience.

### Setting a Narrative

Videos without sound force viewers to rely more on their visual perception of the tale. It can draw your viewers closer to the visuals. Moreover, it also heightens their involvement with the story as it develops.

### Improving Stories

Silence directs the viewer's attention to certain visual aspects. When you remove all sound distractions, the audience can focus on the pictures. It helps you highlight essential story aspects.

For instance, rely on more than just dialogue to convey emotion. Instead, you can take a modest close-up of the character's face.

### Build Emotions With No Audio

One effective method of building intense emotions is the complete absence of sound. Remember, silent clips can keep viewers on the top of their seats. The audience may get more invested in the story's raw essence when a scene unfolds in silence. In short, this technique aims to evoke a range of emotions in the audience.

### Add Metaphor

The lack of audio permits the use of symbolic language only via visual representations. You can use each picture to convey information. It eliminates the need for dialogue or background music.

The audience can interact with the story on a deeper level via interpretation. Here, video scenes, objects, or actions work as symbols.

### Simplify Complex Stories

Silent videos let storytellers elicit strong emotional reactions from audiences. They can co-create the story by deciphering visual cues. Besides, they can also add thoughts, emotions, and interpretations in silent videos. Without words, silent videos can help you convey stories that captivate audiences.

## Why Is It Necessary to Remove Audio from a Video?

You can make a video far more versatile and successful for many different things by removing the audio.

### Place Emphasis on the Video Itself

Cutting off the sound may make the video's visuals the main attraction. It may be beneficial when creating tutorials or instructional videos. That's because viewers may prefer to see the demos without the sound.

### Eliminating Excessive Background Noise

The video might get dull with background noises, echoes, or unwanted sounds. Deleting the audio stream helps to eliminate distractions. As a result, viewers get a cleaner viewing experience.

### Keeping Copyright Concerns at Bay

Businesses can avoid copyright infringement problems by eliminating audio from videos. Removing someone's audio work before using it in public venues is necessary. It supports copyright laws on audio material by limiting display to visual components.

So, how do silent videos improve your video production strategies? Let's find out!

## How Can You Improve Storytelling With Silent Videos?

There is a much unrealized narrative potential in silent videos. Most videos rely only on visual elements to convey narratives. Thus, mute clips have a unique ability to captivate audiences. It also offers many possibilities for storytelling, allowing for a more immersive experience.

### Setting a Narrative

Videos without sound force viewers to rely more on their visual perception of the tale. It can draw your viewers closer to the visuals. Moreover, it also heightens their involvement with the story as it develops.

### Improving Stories

Silence directs the viewer's attention to certain visual aspects. When you remove all sound distractions, the audience can focus on the pictures. It helps you highlight essential story aspects.

For instance, rely on more than just dialogue to convey emotion. Instead, you can take a modest close-up of the character's face.

### Build Emotions With No Audio

One effective method of building intense emotions is the complete absence of sound. Remember, silent clips can keep viewers on the top of their seats. The audience may get more invested in the story's raw essence when a scene unfolds in silence. In short, this technique aims to evoke a range of emotions in the audience.

### Add Metaphor

The lack of audio permits the use of symbolic language only via visual representations. You can use each picture to convey information. It eliminates the need for dialogue or background music.

The audience can interact with the story on a deeper level via interpretation. Here, video scenes, objects, or actions work as symbols.

### Simplify Complex Stories

Silent videos let storytellers elicit strong emotional reactions from audiences. They can co-create the story by deciphering visual cues. Besides, they can also add thoughts, emotions, and interpretations in silent videos. Without words, silent videos can help you convey stories that captivate audiences.

## Detailed Steps to Cut a Video in QuickTime

Filming a video is fun and editing is more interesting and entertaining. Today, everyone is making videos and there are tons of videos on the internet. Editing videos is required to make the video stand out and retain the audience. Video trimming helps you cut out the unwanted part of the video and leave the desired portion of the viewers.

**Cutting a video means your video starts quickly and you don’t lose your audience’s attention**.

The first ten seconds of the video are very important when deciding whether to stay or move on to the next video.

## **How to cut a video in QuickTime**

Quicktime is an authentic application developed by Apple in 1991\. It allows the users to edit, record, play, and share videos and pictures. If some editing software confuses you, **QuickTime** is just for you.

You need to download the application and here are all the features you can enjoy. It is compatible with all versions of windows whereas, if you are a Mac user it is already installed in your system.

Cutting a video is one of the basic but useful functions of QuickTime. It requires a few simple steps and some features related to cutting, splitting, and trimming a video.

Let’s start…

### **1\.** **Cutting/splitting a video**

Cutting a video means splitting some parts of the video to edit and rearrange the clips to make a new video. Mostly, it is used where you want to edit all clips of the video differently. It is also needed as it allows you to focus on your message and delete the portion not required and make the video large. You can remove the extra fat from the video to give clarity, direction, and hope. You can convey your message in a clear and concise way.

These steps should be followed to cut/split the video in minutes.

* In the **QuickTime player**, open the desired video.
* Select **show clips** from the **view** on the menu bar.
* Move the red marker from right to left to select the desired portion.
* Hit **split clip** from the **edit**

* A yellow rectangular bar appears over the edges of your video.

* Press the **done**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-2.png)

Cutting the video by splitting is used when you have a long video and you can easily edit them by splitting them into two parts.

### **2\.** **Trimming a video**

If you are cutting some parts at the beginning and the end of the video, it is called trimming a video. You can say it as removing unnecessary preparation scenes. Normally, professionals start their cameras before the film scene to ensure not to miss any part of the video. Here’s, how to trim video in the QuickTime player.

Let’s dive in…

* Launch **QuickTime**
* Select your **video** from the system.
* Select **edit** from the top menu.
* Select the **trim** or **command T**, or you can select the **hold** option from the drop-down list.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-3.png)

* A **yellow trimming bar** will appear over the edges of your video.
* Remove the unwanted area by moving from the right or left **trim edges** also called **handles**.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-4.png)

Everything inside the **yellow bars** will remain. You can preview your video anytime during the editing process.

* Hit the **trim** from the bottom right corner.
* Select save from the file on the top menu bar.

Trimming is critical because it is the time to convince the viewers to stick around and stay with your video.

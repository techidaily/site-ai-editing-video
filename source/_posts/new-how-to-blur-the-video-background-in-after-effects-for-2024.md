## How to Add a Custom Transition to OBS

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

![add stinger obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-stinger-obs.jpg)

Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.

![name stinger transition obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/name-stinger-transition-obs.jpg)

Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.

![apply cut transition effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg)

Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.

![select transition point field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg)

Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.

![audio monitor output obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-monitor-output-obs.jpg)

Step7 Scroll down and click on Preview Transition button to check if the stinger transition is taking place as expected. You can adjust the transition point and other parameters to get it perfect.

![preview stinger transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-stinger-transition.jpg)

Step8 Finally, click on Ok button and play the video to check out the stinger transition on the big screen.

The steps on how to add a custom transition to Streamlabs OBS are almost similar, and therefore, you can add stinger transition using Streamlabs comfortably.

## Part 1: How to Reduce Echo Noise with Premiere Pro

**Reducing echo in Premiere Pro** is straightforward with the application's built-in tools. It requires no additional plugins from other developers.

Step1 Deverb

The first step is to look for an effect called "DeReverb" in the Effects box of the Effects workspace. Once you find it, you can easily add it to the clip in question by dragging and dropping it there. After that, it will show in the top-left corner of the effect controls inside your audio clip.

Step2 Edit

Next, choose 'Edit' from the drop-down menu, and then set the level of DeReverb by dragging the simple slider below your clip anywhere from 0% to 100%. As you move the slider closer to 100 percent, the echo should begin to vanish almost as soon as you do!

The processing emphasis should be around the flat line unless you know the frequencies you are working with. Additionally, ensure you activate the effect by clicking the button in the upper left corner of the effect window.

_It is vital to bear in mind that less is more when it comes to this effect since it does have a somewhat negative impact on the quality of the audio you have captured._

**Further Dialing in Your Settings**

After you have reached a level of DeReverb that you are satisfied with, you may apply other modifications to the audio, such as compression and EQ. Still, it should already sound more distinct and more apparent at this point.

When you use the DeReverb effect to **remove echo in Premiere Pro**, there is one more cool thing about it. If you tick the box labeled "Auto Gain," the volume level does not decrease as it usually would when you remove echo using this effect. Instead, the volume level maintains the same level as you go from 0 percent to 100 percent of the effect.

The conclusion is as follows: When you are out and about or in an ample space with many echoes, here is a super easy method to manage the echo levels!

The 'Amount' option in DeReverb allows users to specify the percentage of echo they wish to remove. However, use caution while adjusting this parameter since setting it too high can decrease the quality of your audio.

Also, applying the DeReverb effect may decrease the audio level; but if you mark the Auto Gain check box, Premiere Pro will compensate for the decrease in volume. Hence, it is advisable to keep the box checked since this is the default configuration. You also can tinker with the Processing Focus settings, which let you zero in on a specific frequency or frequency.

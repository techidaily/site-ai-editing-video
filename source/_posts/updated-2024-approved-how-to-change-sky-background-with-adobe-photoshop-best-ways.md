## This Article Aims to Show You How to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun

Shooting outdoors is a challenge in most situations. We have to deal with the sun being overexposed or the background is too dark.

In this article, we'll show you how to light with the sun the easiest way. These simple and effective tips can help you block the harsh sun and make it to your advantage!

## 1) Preparation

You may need those things to film under the harsh sun:

1. An ND filter for your lens
2. A flag to block the sun. It can be anything like a black poster.
3. A white poster to bounce the sunlight.
4. Artificial light equipment.

Now let's see when and how to use them against the strong sunlight!

## 2) Direct to the Sun

If we want a specific background for our shot but our talent has to face the sun, here are some tips you can do to undermine the unflattering light or the blindness.

**1\. Pick up an ND filter on your lens**

![pick up an nd filter on lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/len.jpg)

We use it outside so we can open our aperture to get nice blurry backgrounds without overexposing our footage.

**2\. Use a "flag" to block or shape the sunlight**

![black flag](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/black-flag.jpg)

Using a black piece of poster board works perfectly fine, hold it up to the sun. Also, remember to angle your "flag" to create harsh lines or fully shade your talent.

**3\. Adjust your camera to fit the environment**

For example, you can change the exposure of your camera to match the talent's face giving a more silhouette look.

## 3) Back to the Sun

Have you ever been filming outside only to see your talent dark in the frame with the background blown out with light? To fix the problem, the simplest way is to use a "bounce".

By using a "bounce", we can reflect the light from the sun to our talent. Make sure to lift the bounce and move it around to get the right amount of light on your talent.

This should give us a nice look with the sun backlighting our subject and the bounce filling in the shadows and giving us soft light on our talent's face!

## 4) Artificial lighting

If we want to control our lighting better, we will want to use artificial lights in combination with the sun.

For example, weather changes. As you shot, the sun will move and make lighting challenging to keep consistent.

In that case, we can use the **flag technique** that we used before to block the harsh sunlight and then use our lights on our talent's face, this keeps our lighting more consistent than if we relied on just the natural light.

Now, take a look at the comparison with all the lighting conditions we create:

1. Flag VS Flag & Light

![flag vs flag light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/comparison-1.jpg)

1. Backlight VS Backlight & Bounce

![backlight vs backlight bounce](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/comparison-2.jpg)

## Summary

If you shoot or film outdoors, you must learn how to cope with the unsteady natural light. Hope this article helps you with that and kindly leave your thoughts below.

## 8 Frame Rate Video Converters You Must Try

One important aspect to consider when creating high-quality videos is the frame rate. The frame rate, measured in frames per second (fps), determines the smoothness and fluidity of your video. If the frame rate is too low, your video may appear choppy or stutter. On the other hand, a higher frame rate can provide a more cinematic experience.

However, not all cameras or devices record videos at the same frame rate. That's where frame rate video converters come in. These tools allow you to change the frame rate of your videos so they can be played back on different devices or platforms. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to know which frame rate converters to use.

In this article, we'll look at 8 of the best frame rate video converters you must try. These tools will help you achieve the perfect frame rate for your videos, from free online options to paid software.

## Unknown Facts About Converting Frame Rates

When converting frame rates, there are a few things to keep in mind that you may need to be made aware of.

![facts about converting frame rates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facts-convert-frame-rate.jpg)

### 1\. The Web Doesn't Care About Frame Rates

First, it's important to note that the web doesn't care about frame rates. Most online platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo, automatically adjust the frame rate of videos to match the viewer's device or internet connection. This means that even if you have a video with a high frame rate, it may be automatically downgraded when it's uploaded to the web.

### 2\. Converting Frame Rates in Exact Multiples Is Easy

Another thing to remember is that converting frame rates in exact multiples is relatively easy.

For example, if you have a video recorded at 30 fps and want to convert it to 60 fps, it's a simple process as it is a 2x multiple. However, if you want to convert your video to a frame rate that is not a multiple of the original, such as 29.97 fps, the process can be more complex and may result in some loss of quality.

### 3\. Frame Rate Is Not "Cinematic"

Lastly, it's important to note that frame rate is not "cinematic" because a higher frame rate does not automatically make your video look more cinematic. While a higher frame rate can provide a more smooth and more fluid video, it's just one aspect of creating a cinematic experience. Other elements, such as lighting, composition, and sound design, also play a crucial role in creating a cinematic look.

## Learn to Use Montage with These Movies

As with many new things in life, Montage isn't your best friend right off the bat. So, if you want to learn to use montages with movies, they need to be the right ones. If you don't know what Montage is, it is a way of compressing an action or series of actions into a short amount of time. We look at movies because they are a common type of entertainment everyone has seen before, which makes them easier to understand as a concept.

Using Montage is a great way to create engaging video content. There are many people interested in the topic of Montage, so if you get that video out there, you can easily find an audience. When used in conjunction with YouTube advertising, creating videos about Montage could be an excellent business idea for you.

Learning how to use Montage properly can be challenging. The process isn't intuitive, and using it can feel like hiding random pieces around your page. But, when you watch the right movies, they can help you understand how to use this tool effectively. So, take some time, check out these movies, and learn how to get the most out of Montage!

## What Is A Montage?

The definition of a montage is a "series of short scenes or episodes forming a unified whole." That definition can lead to different interpretations of a montage and can be applied to any art medium. A "montage" isn't just for movies. Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.

If you've seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you've probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.

## Purpose of Montage

Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project. Even though these types of movies have become a common genre, there's a list of reasons why this is popular in movies today.

* Montage has several uses in movies. Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm. These different uses of Montage do come with their styles, but they all share a few common traits.
* They're often used to condense periods of storytime into much smaller but more entertaining segments. The word montage is French for "to construct from many parts ."Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.
* This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them. A great example of a montage was used in Rocky when Rocky was training for his fight with Apollo Creed.
* A montage allows filmmakers to explore a theme using several sequential shots that can't be covered in a single shot.

## Are You Looking to Turn on the Motion Blur Effect in Minecraft? Learn How You Can Turn the Effect on or Off with the Help of the Best Methods

Minecraft has been one of the most played games in the community. Known among hundreds of thousands of users, this game has been a prominent choice of many YouTube gamers. Streamers from all over the world are fond of playing this strategy game.

Although the game tentatively has a very basic graphic system, it has improved a lot with multiple features. Such is the addition of **Minecraft motion blur,** which has had mixed reviews throughout the community. For this article, we will be working on how to turn on/off the motion blur effect in Minecraft. The discussion covers everything related to the feature and its functionality.

![minecraft motion blur featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Motion Blur in Games?

Before you further discuss **Minecraft motion blur,** it might be vital for you to understand what the effect actually is. Motion blur effect has made a mark in video editing for presenting a realistic approach to videos.

For fast-moving objects, you can consider using the motion blur effect to display their swiftness. The use of the effect is consistently based on improving the user experience and showing objects in a realistic environment. The use of motion blur in games is based on providing a similar experience that was considered for videos.

As most games utilize stop-motion animation, it tends to lag at a lower frame rate. Motion blur enhances the gaming effects and smoothens them in a lower frame rate. This allows users to get a smooth game experience at a lower and adjustable frame rate. Motion blur in games has been added with the objective of smoothening the gameplay.

## Part 2: Does Minecraft Have Motion Blur?

Minecraft has provided the option of including the motion blur effect in its game. For a better visual experience, this effect has turned out to be quite beneficial. The existence of motion blur in Minecraft is equivalent to smoother gameplay, which is accomplished under a low frame rate. Rather than having screens with higher frame rates, you can get a low-end option.

All of this is essentially possible with the help of the motion blur effect. Even though Minecraft has a low-graphic display, it does not lag with motion blur. This is why the particular effect is recognized and acknowledged in the market. It has been discovered that Minecraft allows users to add motion blur from the graphic settings.

However, you must ensure that the device you are implementing has the tendency to control and manage the change and smoothness. Improper management of the motion blur under complex conditions will lead to multiple problems.

## Part 3: How to Get Motion Blur in Minecraft?

With an overview of the motion blur effect and what it is, we will now see how it can be obtained in the game. For the following steps, it can indeed work on the latest Minecraft versions, but it is precisely for versions 1.7.10 and 1.8.9.

Furthermore, we will focus on two different techniques to go along for getting motion blur in Minecraft. Let’s proceed to find out **how to get motion blur in Minecraft** by following these two methods:

### Method 1: Using PVP Clients

Step1 You can consider using any appropriate PVP client, such as [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) or [Badlion](https://www.badlion.net/), as they provide the appropriate mods to get motion blur in Minecraft. To start the process, you will have to install the PVP client on your computer from their official website.

![launch the lunar client](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-3.jpg)

Step2 Launch the client and proceed to select the version of Minecraft you are using and load the game. As you are within the game, move into the “Options” and look for “Video Settings.”

![access the video settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-4.jpg)

Step3 Look for the "Performance" options in the following settings and turn off "Fast Render" within the options. Once done, use the "Right Shift" button on your keyboard to access the Lunar Client menu. From there, you can set the intensity of motion blur from the available options.

### Method 2: Use Forge

Step1 Another technique existing for getting motion blur within Minecraft is through [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/). While it is pretty common within the gaming community, it provides the option of using motion blur within the game. You must open their official website and download the version you wish to add to your game. In some cases, you might require installing Java on your computer.

## Part 4: How to Disable Motion Blur in Minecraft?

What if you are looking for the right technique to disable the motion blur in Minecraft? In some cases, you might feel the issue of disabling the effect within the game as it might be messing with other things. To prevent your gameplay from getting dismantled, you will have to know how to disable it. For that, we will look into a guide showing **how to turn off motion blur in Minecraft:**

Step1 If you have used "Shaders" to get motion blur within the Minecraft game, you will have to access them. For that, open the game and redirect to its "Settings." Proceed to the "Video Settings" and load into the "Shaders" menu.

![tap on the shaders option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-10.jpg)

Step2 Next, select "Shader Options" from the bottom-right corner of the screen and find the "Post-Processing Settings."

![select the post-processing settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-11.jpg)

Step3 On the next screen, you will have to turn off the “Motion Blur” option and decrease the “Bloom Strength” to 0.1\. Click “Done” to save the settings.

![turn off the motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-12.jpg)

## Why Do We Need To Add A Camera Shake Effect To The Video?

Have you ever tried to add a simple camera shake effect to your videos? You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.

Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you're filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there's lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.

A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you're making a video that's meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that's supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:

* This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.
* Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they've seen similar videos before.
* Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.
* It's a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren't perfect humans, so we can't make perfect videos every time!"
* You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).
* You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer/audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.

## How to add camera shake to video in After Effects

When it comes to video editing, knowing how to make a layer shake in After Effects is a very useful skill. Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.

### Step 1\. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file

Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.

![camera shake effects for premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Step 2\. Press the alt/option key, then click the stopwatch next to "position."

You are adding an "expression" to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.

By pressing the alt/option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside "position" and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.

![use camera shake in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-2.jpg)

### Step 3\. Enter "Wiggle (3,8)" and adjust the settings accordingly

In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle -- basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The "Wiggle (10,3)" command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.

### Step 4\. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition

In order to make the overall effect more "choppy," you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition> Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as "8" if you want a choppy feel.

![how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg)

Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.

## How to Use Blender Green Screen

Blender is an open-source cross-platform 3D graphics program, but this doesn’t mean it’s a low-rent option. Just like commercial packages like Lightwave 3D, it is also a very capable compositing package. Unlike Lightwave, it is a modern node-based compositor like Nuke or Fusion. It’s not what the software is designed for, but it does a bangup job of green screen compositing, as you will soon see.

Blender green screen uses technique of the ****chroma key** a color is isolated (in our case the green of the****green screen**), or a particular luminance, it is removed and the area that was occupied by it becomes transparent, thus becoming part of the alpha channel. The transparent parts will thus show the video or the image below, which will thus define the environment in which the subject of the first movie will act.

## How to Use Green Screen in Blender

So we need to pull these two elements into Blender and pull a key on the green bits to make the background show through in as naturalistic a way as possible. Blender is a node-based compositor which means the control mechanism is nodes or little LEGO blocks of love which you place on the screen and link with little strings which form your signal path.

![blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-interface.jpg)

Locate the drop-down (it goes up, actually, but you know what we mean) at the bottom of the view, and select “Movie Clip Editor.”

Click the “Open” button and choose and load your green screen footage. (You can also load sequences of images for uncompressed keys in this step if you have the space, and the footage is the right size.)

Once the clip is loaded, go back to the drop-down and select Node Editor.

The screen will be blank, but just go to the bottom of the view and click the middle button marked “Node Tree Type” to Display, and then check the Use Nodes and Backdrop buttons.

Select the “Render Layers” node, and because we won’t need it you can delete it (on the Mac this is the Forward Delete key). Then move the Compositing node out of the way because we won’t need it yet.

****Note:** to zoom in and out of the nodes, use the centre scroll wheel of the mouse if you have it. To zoom in and out of the images you are working on, use the V and Alt-V keys.

****Compositing Nodes**

Click the Add menu in the bar at the bottom of the view and select “Input -> Movie Clip.” Select the green screen clip you added in the Movie Clip Editor. This is the input. We have to push this through a keyer to remove the green and make those areas transparent.

****Important:** in this program flow goes from left to right, so node inputs are on the left of a node, and outputs are on the right of a node.

Now select “Add -> Matte -> Keying” to add a keying node. Also “Add -> Output -> Viewer” to make the output from the key visible. Click on the little yellow dot next to Image output on the Input node, and drag it to Image input on the Keying node. Then drag the little dot next to Image output on the keying node, and drag it to the image input on the viewer node.

You now have to select the key colour, the colour which the keyer is changing to transparent. Click the Key Colour button on the Keying node, and this displays a colour selector. Click the eyedropper, and click on the image in the background somewhere on the green screen.

If you look carefully, you will see that there are some areas which still have a bit of colour and are not fully transparent. You can check this more accurately by dragging the string from the Matte output on the Keying node and linking to the input on the viewer. This is the key you have made. As you can see, the dark bits are supposed to be totally black, and there are still greys showing through. (This is because the source material wasn’t perfect.)

There are many different ways to fix this depending on the shot, but if it’s a reasonably well-shot green screen, all you will need to do is the following.

Adjust the Black Clip slider to expand the amount of greens which turn to black. Then adjust the White Clip to push the whites to prevent them from becoming transparent.

Once you have pure white and pure black, reconnect the image output of the keying node to the image input on the viewer, and you’ll see you have a decent key.

You can adjust the amount of fringing and spill (reflections from the green screen on the model), but generally the keyer does a good job of guessing that for you with a decently-shot green screen.

****Adding the background**

After this, adding the background is more of the same with a slight twist. “Add -> Input -> Movie Clip,” navigate to your background clip and load it.

To blend the two layers, you have to make a mix of the two clips so that the background shows through the now transparent bits of the foreground.

“Add -> Colour -> Mix node”. Take the output from the background clip, and feed it to the top image input of the mix node. Take the output from the keying node, and feed it into the lower image input on the mix node.

Click the Alpha channel button next to the drop-down on the mix node.

And finally we have our key. The background is way too sharp and makes the green screen footage look really soft and crappy, so we need to soften the background. There is a really nice Bokeh Blur filter in blender for just this purpose to make the background look out of focus and add lots of gorgeous Bokeh blobs.

“Add -> Filter -> Bokeh Blur” and put it between the background clip and the mix. In Blender, if you add a node and place it over a string between two nodes, the string goes yellow, and dropping it will automatically insert the new node into the signal path connecting inputs and outputs.

Finally add an image to the Bokeh Blur for the shape you want the bokeh to be; we opted for a donut-shaped iris pattern.

To render out your video, connect the output of the Mix node to the input of the compositing node we left lying about earlier. It’s okay for this output to be connected to the input node of the viewer, too, as this means we see progress while rendering.

Make sure you are set up to render the right amount of frames at 30fps in the render panel on the far right. 30fps for 5 seconds (the duration of our clip) is 150 frames. Insert 150 where it says End Fr.

Select a place and a filename to output to in the Output panel further down the right-hand side. Then to render, select the info menu bar from the top-left drop-down, and finally choose “Render Menu -> Render Animation,” and the render will begin.

## Conclusion

Obviously, to get the best green screen composites you have to shoot good “plates.” “Plates” are the main bits of the shot that you bolt together in movie visual effects. You have the foreground plate and the green screen bit with an actor filmed in front of a green screen. Then you have the background plate which is the bit you want to show through the green bits of the foreground, making the whole thing look as though the background and foreground were filmed at the same time.

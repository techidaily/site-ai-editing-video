## Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters You Should Know

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

Any current video playback device can play videos generated with this program, and the quality is so outstanding that you can play them on huge LCD displays. Though this video to ppt converter is accessible for free, its free edition lacks all of the capabilities that make this program an excellent alternative for professionals that prepare PowerPoint presentations on a consistent basis. It's possible to get the commercial edition of this Windows-based tool and have all of the multimedia you include in the presentations converted to video without losing any quality.

##### Pros

You may use this to burn DVDs.

All PowerPoint file types are supported.

##### Cons

However, basic PPT to video file conversion is only available in the free edition of the product.

There is no possibility to convert many files at once.

### 5.Camtasia Studio

![camtasia-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camtasia-studio-poster.jpg)

**Price: A free trial is offered, and a single-user license is $249.**

There is much more to Camtasia Studio than simply a video to ppt converter in it. An unencumbered trial edition of this video editing program helps you create professional-looking films from PowerPoint presentations. Camtasia Studio's single-user license is a good alternative for those who just need to convert a few presentations for free, but if you're searching for a full-featured video to ppt converter, you should consider purchasing Camtasia.

When using the software's premium edition, you may add multimedia files, such as PowerPoint presentations and webcam footage to your final video project. With Camtasia Studio, you can easily post your films in nearly any video file type on social media.

##### Pros

With Camtasia Studio, adding transitions, callouts, or text effects is a cinch.

Advanced video editing tools are available.

##### Cons

Only 30 days are included in the free trial.

Expensive.

## Conclusions

When looking for the best PowerPoint conversion software, there are a lot of factors to consider. The output quality, the ability to use PowerPoint effects, compatibility with new devices, & one publishing are all key considerations. Get a free trial of iSpring Converter Pro, the number one choice on our list, if you need a dependable video to ppt converter that can handle any amount of slides and animations in your presentation.

## YouTube Lives Are Very Popular Nowadays and People Can Interact with the Anchor at Real Time. If You Want to Comment on a YouTube Live Chat, You Can Follow the Guide Below

YouTube continues to grow in popularity. On this platform, users of YouTube can view and upload videos as well as debate them live. Live chat on YouTube is described in this article.

Let's start off!

![youtube live chat comment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/youtube-live-chat-comment.jpg)

## 1\. What is YouTube live chat?

Every day, more than 30 million individuals use YouTube to upload and watch entertaining videos. Many individuals are interested in having a conversation with the video's producer or later on discussing these films with others. You can now have live video chats on YouTube using the Google+ Hangouts On Air service because Google's YouTube has opened up its live streaming service to all users in good standing.

The live chat box appears to the right of the video player as soon as the live stream starts. Both the video and the live chat's material will be archived once the live stream stops. People can rewatch the video with live chat if necessary.

On YouTube, there are two different live chat views:

* Best chat: The messages that may hurt you are filtered out in this display.
* Live chat: No messages are filtered in this display.

Additionally, the live chat will not be available if the channel or live stream is intended for children.

## 2\. How to comment on YouTube live chat?

YouTube users would like to comment on the live chat when the stream starts. Here are the steps for posting a comment in the YouTube Live Chat

Step1Create a YouTube account and sign in using your username and email. You cannot post any messages at tall if you are not signed into your YouTube account.

Step2Join the live stream. Click the live stream that you want to watch after selecting it.

Step3Click where it says, "Live Chat" and start typing anything you want to publish in the chat box. Next, select the

send button.

Additionally, a number of YouTube viewers frequently lament their inability to comment on livestreams or the fact that their messages keep disappearing. Because certain comments are flagged as spam and filtered, this is the cause. There is no other option but to post constructive criticism. If the streamer is one you enjoy or if you don't want to miss the author's next live stream. Then choose "HIDE Chat" if you don't want to see any comments at all. The procedures below can be used if you simply want to have a private conversation or reply to someone.

## Conclusion

You now know what YouTube live chat is and how to participate in it thanks to this post. I hope it will be beneficial to you.

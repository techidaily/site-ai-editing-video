This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.

## How Long Does It Take To Edit Videos

If you want to put together the pieces for online videos the number one thing most of the time takes is **editing.**

**Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?**

* **Too many choices.**

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

## **How to Edit Video Faster with the Best Video Editor**

Microsoft has added the Photos app to Windows 10 and has added a fully functional video editor. You can do all sorts of things like trimming and splitting clips and re-organizing clips.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-7.jpg)

The great news is you don’t have to go out and buy a video editor or search for the video editor to download on your system instead if you are Windows 10 you already have some awesome software to edit your videos.

## **2\.** **CapCut App for Android.**

CapCut is the best video editing app, whether you are making videos for youtube, TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook. It is a free and all-in-one video editing app and you can use it without watermarks and annoying ads. The good thing about this app is, that it is very easy to use. Now let’s have a quick overview of the CapCut app.

* After opening your video select the clips you want to edit and here you will get a project timeline.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-8.jpg)

* Here you can **add, move or replace** clips and can perform even more editing in the timeline.

* You can **split, trim,** and **delete**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-9.jpg)

You can also apply some filters and adjustments. Adding **text, stickers**, and **audio** and the rest of the editing is just fun doing in CapCut. You can change the **animation** and **style** of your video in just a few clicks.

It also provides us with the **Effects** options.

1. The **video effects** are effects on the entire video.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-11.jpg)

Let’s enjoy its advanced features without paying for monthly subscription.

## **3\.** **Davinci Resolve for Mac.**

The Davinci Resolve is the most professional video editing software on Mac. It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free. Along with this, it is very professional video editing software that people used to create Hollywood movies and that kind of stuff. It provides a very easy and professional interphase that anyone can use without having training.

* The controls and features in the software are amazing and can edit videos **frame by frame.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-12.jpg)

* There is also a dedicated area for **audio creation**.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-13.jpg)

* The **motion graphics** and

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-14.jpg)

* A specific area just for **color grading** and **color correcting.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-15.jpg)

That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a **finishing application** of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

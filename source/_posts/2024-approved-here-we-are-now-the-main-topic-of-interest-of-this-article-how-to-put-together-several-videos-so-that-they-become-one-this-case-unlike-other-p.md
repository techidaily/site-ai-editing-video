## Here We Are, Now the Main Topic of Interest of This Article - How to Put Together Several Videos so that They Become One? This Case, Unlike Other Possibilities We Discussed Above, Is More Complicated, so We Will Study This Feature Step by Step

Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?

Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.

One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

**Technique one:**

* Step one:

## An Easier Way to Merge Videos in A Few Clicks

It's true that merging videos in VLC Media Player takes quite a few steps, so to speak. But is this the only editing program in which a similar operation can be performed? Of course not. Therefore, in our article, we decided to offer you an alternative, where you can also easily merge the videos. This is the famous [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , a software that is one of the easiest and most convenient to work with, especially for those who want to edit videos without having much experience in "complicated" software before. So again, [step by step guideline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elI5Fb8kBKQ) on how to put together our video clips in Wondershare Filmora.

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora.

When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

## How to Make a Super Easy Rotating Video Effect

Controlling camera direction to the subject's hands and filming is trending nowadays. Create this effect by using easy film hacks, as shown in this article.

Many users make rotating illusion videos for TikTok or any branding video. The foremost items to record are explained in this article with detailed instructions. The best editing tool is also clarified below for instant results. So keep reading to get a hand with filming and editing a professional rotating transition video!

## Part 1\. What is a Rotating Video Illusion/Effect

Rotating transition video is a trending feature used by models and influencers. The brands also use this style to record the model's videos in advertisements. It could be any makeup transition or clothing transition video.

![final preview of rotating video illusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-1.gif)

It helps to indulge the audience with your content and show the after and before transitions. You can try this with any object or any character. But first, let's figure out the requirements for rotating effects.

## Part 2\. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect

You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.

### The Subject Matters

To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it's you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:

* The person should get two different costumes.
* All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting
* Show affinity and control of the camera.

![character of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-2.png)

### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.

![smartphone for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png)

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

## Now, You Can Also Apply the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect to Your Video! This Effect Combines Camera Tricks and Video Editing Within Filmora to Transition From the Normal World Into the Upside Down

With stranger things season 4 ending, it seems like great timing to make a stranger things style transition to the Upside Down. In the Netflix series Stranger Things, there is an opposite version of our world called the Upside Down. The Upside Down is dark, creepy, and possibly filled with aliens, monsters, creatures, and other things.

Now, you can also apply the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect to your video! This effect combines camera tricks and video editing within [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to transition from the normal world into the Upside Down.

## How-to Guide

_**1) Preparation**_

To make this effect, you will need two footage shots: one with the camera moving down and one with the camera coming back up.

When shooting for the footage, follow the steps below:

**First shot**

1. Find any item close enough to the ground that we can block our frame with.

![block our frame with item](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-1.jpg)

1. Once you have your talent lined up, rotate your camera while lowering it below the foreground item at a constant speed and leaving the camera there. The key is making sure when you go behind the object, the frame is nothing but black.

![rotate your camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-2.gif)

For the next scene, have your actor change positions, or you can change the set around to look like the Upside Down. For instance, adding fake plants and flickering lights.

**Second shot**

Start bringing your camera back up at the same speed and rotate it again in the direction it was moving.

![start bringing your camera back up](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-3.gif)

_**2) Steps**_

After you have all the footage, you can start editing it on Filmora. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download Filmora at their official website at <https://filmora.wondershare.com>.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Now, launch Filmora on your PC and follow the steps below:

Step1 Take your first clip in the “normal” world and drag it down to a video track on the timeline. Trim the edge of the clip, so it ends on pure black and in a downward motion.

![trim the edge of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-4.jpg)

Step2 Drag the second clip (in the Upside Down) onto the video track on the timeline after the first clip. Trim this video, so it begins in pure black and an upward motion.

![trim video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-5.jpg)

Cut the clips to get the timing right since it should be a very fast transition. You can cut in the black frames so they won't be too apparent.

If you don't have a perfectly smooth transition, you can add a dissolve by going to **Transitions > Basic > Dissolve**.

![cut the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-6.jpg)

**Color Grading and Effects**

After the transition, you can make the clip look a lot more like the Upside Down from the show with a color grade and Filmora effects. Follow the steps below:

Step1 Double-click on your second clip, then go to **Color > Advanced**. For a quick edit, you can try one of the presets available, such as “cool film.” It will give you the colder blue tones that Stranger Things used for the Upside Down.

![go to color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-7.jpg)

Step2 You can further edit the color grading in the white balance menu. Drag the slider to the left to get a blue, cold vibe for the Upside Down.

The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.

![further edit the color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-8.gif)

Step3 Next, move down to the color, lower the brightness and increase contrast. It makes the scene darker and more sinister than the normal world.

![move down to the color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-9.jpg)

Step4 Finally, go down to the vignette and drag the amount slider a tiny bit to give a Vinnette around your clip.

![go down to the vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-10.jpg)

_**3) Pro Tips**_

You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.

Go to **Elements > Smoke > Smokescreen 2**. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.

![drag this element on top of your upside down clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-11.jpg)

You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.

Finally, go to the **Transition > Basic > Dissolve** to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.

![open the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-12.jpg)

## Resources from Filmostock

You can also use filmstock effects to bring our video to the next level. Go to **Elements > Fire > Large Scale 12** and drag it down on top of your clip and the smoke.

![go to elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-13.jpg)

Double-click the clip and change the scale of the effect to your needs. Then, go to compositing to change the blending mode to the screen to help the effect blend in more.

![change the scale of the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-14.jpg)

Now, go to color and open the white balance menu. Drag the two sliders to change the color of the particles to match your clip.

## How to Make Strobe Light Text Effect?

In video editing, professionals put in different types of effects to create a unique feel to the visuals. In fact, there are different styles available that you can use in videos to create a specific feel in the viewers—case in point, strobe lights.

This technique involves a series of intense short flashes of light in sections of the clip that create a suspenseful or thrilling ambiance, amping up the horror feel in viewers and more. You might have seen many examples of this in horror movies, thrillers, suspense or action-filled movies, sci-fi films, etc. Similarly, adding the effect to the titles gives a cinematic feel to them.

As a film or video editor, are you interested in adding this effect to your own project as well? Luckily, you do not need significant technical know-how or invest in different types of high-grade equipment to manage it - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows users to add the effect easily in the titles. Want to know how? Read ahead.

## Launch the software first

Of course, before you can begin adding the effect to your video, you must have the software. The downloading process for Wondershare Filmora 11 is very straightforward as long as you have a Mac or Windows PC.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

First, visit the official website to download the software. The Download button at the top of the screen or the description box is available to click on. That will instantly allow the Filmora installer to download into your device.

![tap the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-1.jpg)

Double-click on the installer from your notifications or browser downloads section, then click Install. Allow the prompt for permission approval when it comes up, and the installation process will begin. This would take a little bit of time, and you can tap on the Start Now button at the last window that opens.

![click install](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-2.jpg)

## Add the title

The editor will open automatically next. You have to tap on the Create New Project button to access the editing screen, tap on the Titles tab, and choose the Default Title. If you prefer another version, browse through the different title presets available as options and download the one you prefer.

![drag and drop default title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-3.jpg)

Then, drag the title from this section and drop it into the editing timeline. Double-click on the title in the timeline to open the title editing window. Insert the text you want to add as the title in the text field and adjust the size, font, and other font modifications here.

## Edit the title and click snapshots

Then, you should drag the title clip you added to the timeline to an upper section and click on the Media tab following that. Then, choose the Sample Color option from the listed menu and tap on the Black color choice. After doing so, drag it down to the timeline onto the track under the Default Title clip you added and moved up.

Consequently, click on the Snapshot icon at the right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will take a screenshot of the black color picture you added second.

![add second color image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-4.jpg)

Then you should double-click on the original Default Title you added and start editing your title text once more. This time, add the term you want to appear under your original title here. Adjust the font for it as something other than the original one. For example, if you put Motor Oil 1937 M54 as the first title font, set the second as Montserrat SemBold. Make more adjustments, if necessary, to the font. Then, retake a snapshot of it.

![change the second title text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-5.jpg)

## Insert the snapshots

Remove the two title clips you added to the timeline. You have to work with the Snapshots you took now.

It is possible that you will not see the Snapshots saved in your media folder. In this case, tap on the "Click here to insert media" section and go to the device library. It will open in the Wondershare Filmora folder; if not, search for it and access it.

In the folder, double-click on the Snapshot folder. Choose both of the Snapshots you saved right now from here and tap on Open to import them into Filmora.

![choose and import both snapshots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-6.jpg)

## Import additional music and background visuals

After you have imported the snapshots to Filmora, you have to tap on the Import File option again. Go to the folder where you saved specific files like Lens flare, background video, particles, and sound effect clips. If you have these previously saved in other folders, make sure to keep them all in one folder ahead of time and open that one here.

Choose all files and click on Open to add them to the Filmora software. Now starts the process of merging them all into one cohesive effect.

![open all of the files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-7.jpg)

## Drag the files into the timeline

The background video is the first file you will drag and drop to the timeline. For the best effect, choose a flashing light background video. Next, drag the first title you edited into Track 2, right above the first one. Make sure to adjust the length of the clip to match the background video length. Repeat the same for the second snapshot, adding it above the first snapshot in the timeline.

![drag and drop the background video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-8.jpg)

## Edit the snapshots via Chroma Key and Composting

You must hide the second snapshot you added, i.e., the one in the 3rd Track on the timeline. After that, click on snapshot 1 and tap on the Chroma Key icon in the toolbar right above the timeline.

When the Chroma Key window opens, tap on the Select Color option and go to the “More…” option. Tap on the basic white color and click on OK.

Following it, move the slider for Edge Thickness to extend it and see the preview to know if you are satisfied with the amount. Then, click on the unhide icon for the second snapshot. Right-click on it and tap on the Composting option. Under the Blending Mode parameter, change the option to Screen. The title background will remove automatically.

Press OK.

## Add the sound effect

Again, you must hide the second snapshot in the timeline with the same step as before. Then, drag the sound effect to the audio track timeline next. Tap on the Play button under the Preview to see how the effect looks with the sound. Cut out the extra second of the sound effect clip to align it with the ending section of all of the other clips.

## Add the initial keyframes

Choose the first snapshot in the timeline, below the second snapshot, and above the background video clip. Then, double-click on it to open the editor window and choose the Animation tab this time instead of Image.

Add the keyframe here and change the value of the Scale parameter to 400 or something high like that. In the preview, you will see that most of the font in this title is out of frame. After this, click on Rotate and turn the font to 45 degrees.

![click on rotate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-10.jpg)

Move your playhead on this snapshot clip in the timeline by at least 1 second. Then, add another keyframe in this location by tapping the Add button. Here, reset the Scale and Rotate parameters and press the OK button to end.

## Add the lens flare and particle video

Next, go back to the media section where all the files you added are present and drag your lens flare clip to the timeline, right on the track above the last one you added. Drop it here and adjust the length of it to match others if it does not show that automatically.

Above it, drag and drop the Particles video from the media files you added previously onto the track above the lens flare one. Do the same to delete the spare part by moving the play head to that point, clicking on the scissor icon, and removing the extra part.

Then, double-click on this Particles video clip on the timeline and go to the Compositing section. Tap on the Blending Mode drop-down choice and choose the Screen option. Press OK. Next, repeat the same for the lens flare video and tap the OK button.

Now, play the preview again.

## Adjust the second title, again

Remember how you clicked on the hide button for the second snapshot for title 2? Now, you have to click on the unhide icon beside it.

Move the play head to the 3-second mark from the beginning. If you need clarification on this, check if the lens flare effect is beginning to start below the first title at this point. Move your playhead to that point for the second snapshot.

Here, tap on the Split icon and remove the clip's first half. Then, double-click on the second half and go to Animation. Press the Add button to insert a keyframe here and change the scale and position of the title at this point. Move it to the placement you want, right above the lens flare. Also, drag the slider for the Opacity parameter to zero at this point.

![drag the slider for opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-12.jpg)

Subsequently, move the play head to the point when the lens flare effect stop, which is around 2 seconds more. At this point, you have to add another keyframe and change the Opacity to 100.

Play the preview of the whole thing to see how the effect looks in completion.

## Edit the title and click snapshots

Then, you should drag the title clip you added to the timeline to an upper section and click on the Media tab following that. Then, choose the Sample Color option from the listed menu and tap on the Black color choice. After doing so, drag it down to the timeline onto the track under the Default Title clip you added and moved up.

Consequently, click on the Snapshot icon at the right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will take a screenshot of the black color picture you added second.

![add second color image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-strobe-light-text-effect-4.jpg)

Then you should double-click on the original Default Title you added and start editing your title text once more. This time, add the term you want to appear under your original title here. Adjust the font for it as something other than the original one. For example, if you put Motor Oil 1937 M54 as the first title font, set the second as Montserrat SemBold. Make more adjustments, if necessary, to the font. Then, retake a snapshot of it.

4. You can reposition the crop by either moving the video itself or the crop area.
5. Crop the unwanted portion by hitting the Crop button again or pressing the Enter key. You can also click on the Slide Area to apply the cropping changes.

#### How to Play Video Inside a Shape

If you want to edit your video and enhance its appearance, you can have it play inside a unique shape instead of the usual rectangle format that videos play in. In turn, you'll draw attention to your video.

To play your video in an unusual shape, select your video and navigate to the Format tab. Then, go to the Video Shape menu, where you'll see multiple shapes to choose from.

#### How to Apply Preset Video Styles

You can also liven up your video by applying one of the pre-designed styles that PowerPoints provides. These styles combine various effects, including bevels, reflections, shadows, tilts, and frames.

Applying preset video styles is a simple process. Select the video, then navigate to the Format tab. Click More under the Video Style section. You'll see a gallery of preset styles; roll your mouse over it and hold the cursor over any style type. The program will apply a live preview of this style to your video.

## Part 2\. Pros and Coins about TS Video Format

Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!

### Advantages of TS File Format

A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.

Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.

### Drawbacks of TS File Format

Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.

Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.

## Part 3\. How to Play TS Video Files with VLC Media Player?

## Part 5\. TS VS. MP4: What's the Difference?

What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:

### TS

TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.

### MP4

MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the '.ts' extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.

### Bottom Line

## Step-By-Step Guide To Creating Halftone Effects In Photoshop

Halftone is a technique that uses dots to create a deliberate screen-like image and textured effect. In recent years, it has become trendy in digital design.

This effect is often used in magazines, newspapers, and other printed materials. When applied correctly, it can add depth and dimension to an image, resulting in a softer, more pleasing, and appealing look.

So, if you have ever wanted to add interesting effects and textures to your images, but weren't sure where to start, then keep on reading to discover and learn everything you need to know regarding **creating the halftone printing effect in Photoshop.**

Without further ado, let’s get started!

## What Are Halftone Effects?

Before we know [how to create a halftone effect in Photoshop](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let's have a basic understanding of it first.

In the 19th century, William Henry Fox Talbot introduced the **halftone screen printing** effect to create the illusion of tones in black and white images.

The halftone originated from printers who previously only worked with cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ([CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel)). The solid colors were tiny dots placed together closely with continuous tones that remained unchanged. From the mixing and matching of these four colors, a wide range of colors emerged.

The effect is usually created by putting dots of ink on paper in different sizes and positions. This illusion uses optical bleeding to make the desired impression on the human eye. These color dots act like analog **pixels** that result in a recognizable image.

For instance, when you look at a pixelated picture and zoom it, you will see missing details. When you zoom out, the photo gets more minor and back to its original form.

### Modern Definition and Usage

In the 21st century, the halftone is a static-visual technique applied in print and digital images to create continuous tone imagery using dots that vary in spacing and size to create a gradient effect.

Halftone produces a deliberate screen-like image distortion in different fields, such as pop art, graphic designing, and screen printing, to create nostalgic or vintage effects and make the images more captivating.

## How To Use Photoshop To Create Halftone Printing Effect

Below we’ve provided detailed step-by-step guidance on creating a color halftone effect as well as black and white halftone printing effects in Photoshop:

### 1\. How to Create Color Halftone Effect

If you want to create a color halftone effect in Photoshop, do the following steps in a sequence:

Step1 Launch the **Photoshop** software on your laptop/desktop, and drag and drop the image file on which you want to apply the Halftone effect.

Step2 Click **“Filters”** in the top toolbar and select the **“Pixelate”** option from the drop-down menu.

Step3 Click the **“Color Halftone”** option from the menu. On the new pop-up window, adjust the radius and channel to configure the appearance of the effect.

![creating color halftone effect in photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/creating-color-halftone-effect-in-photoshop.png)

That’s about it! You have successfully created the color halftone effect in Photoshop.

### 2\. How to Create Black and White Halftone Effect

Follow these steps to **create black and white halftone printing effect:**

Step1 Open your image in **Adobe Photoshop** and click the **“Image”** option from the top taskbar.

Step2 Now, click the **“Mode”** option from the drop-down menu and select **“Greyscale”** to convert your RGB image.

![select greyscale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/changing-rgb-image-to-grey-scale-to-create-black-and-white-halftone-effect.png)

Step3 Again, open the image menu and click the **“Mode”** option. From the drop-down options, click **“Bitmap…”**

![click the mode option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/setting-bitmap-to-create-halftone-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step4 A dialogue box will open. Set the resolution to 1000, 1,500, or 2,000ppi to create smooth edges on your halftone. Next, click **“Halftone Screen…”** under the **“Method”** header and click **“OK”** to proceed further.

Now, you can adjust the frequency (Lines/Inch), angle (Degrees), and shape (Circle, Line, Cross, etc.) to determine how big your halftone dots are at the maximum diameter and their direction.

Step5 Finally, click **“Files”** from the top taskbar, scroll down, and select **“Save As…”** Save your file as **PSD or TIFF** and import it to **InDesign** to apply color.

### Video Tutorial - How To Create Halftone Effect | Photoshop 2022

To help you better put the guidance into practice, we have prepared a video tutorial to deepen your understanding.

## Two Concepts You Should Know In Creating Halftone Effect

Apart from the practical guidance, there are two important concepts you need to be aware of: radius and channels. Below, we’ve discussed both of them in detail to make things more understandable to you:

### 1\. Radius

Radius refers to the size of the dots that make up the halftone image and is an important factor in determining the overall look of the photo.

You can adjust the sizes of the dots to change the gradient, spacing in between, and blur of the color and image. However, if you want a more subtle effect, you will need to use a smaller radius. For a more dramatic effect, like vintage comics, old ads, or DIY grunge zines., you will need to use a larger radius.

### 2\. Channel

Channel refers to the number of values that are used to create the image. The more values you use, the more details will be visible.

The Channel setting of halftone effects affects how the dots are positioned and overlap. Each Channel is governed by a Screen Angle setting, which is listed in degrees. Changing the value modifies the angle at which Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black dots are added to the pattern. When the dots overlap, a new color is created depending on the combination of the primary colors and black.

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we've explored the halftone effect, how it originated and discussed its modern definition and usage. We've also provided step-by-step processes to help you create the halftone effect in Photoshop, both colored and black and white.

Furthermore, we discussed two important concepts (radius and channel) of the halftone screen printing effect to help you understand the technique in detail.

## Time Lapse Video Is Very Interesting and Creative, Which Usually Attracts More Attention. This Article Will Show You How to Make a Time Lapse Video with Adobe After Effects

Time-Lapse movies are great for a variety of projects; you can use them as establishing shots in sitcoms, corporate marketing videos, and they can make lovely backgrounds for animated slideshows. A time-lapse video is essentially a series of photographs taken at regular intervals to depict how the environment changes gradually over a shorter period of time. In this article, we'll demonstrate how you may quickly and easily build an After Effects time-lapse effect.

With that said, let's start!

## Step 1\. Create a new composition

Calculating your composition length to accommodate the frame rate and number of images is the first step in generating a time-lapse video.

1. Verify the number of images you have for your Sequence.
2. New Composition Creation. Selecting a frame rate: A time lapse film produced at 30 frames per second will flow smoothly, but you can select any frame rate you like.
3. To determine the duration of your composition, divide the number of photographs you have by the frame rate you've chosen. For instance, if you use 600 photos at 30 frames per second, your composition will last 20 seconds.

## Step 2\. Import your images

You are prepared to make a time-lapse sequence if all of your photographs are saved to the same folder and are in the same order. If you are working directly from your Camera, you will likely have Camera Raw files, although this procedure works with PNG and JPEG sequences.

1. Press Command/Control I on your keyboard or select File > Import. Find the folder holding your image sequence.
2. To begin, select the first picture in the sequence. If all of your images have accurate names, After Effects will be able to identify a sequence of images.
3. Make sure the Force Alphabetical Order and Camera Raw Sequence checkboxes are selected. Your Time-Lapse Sequence will display in the Project Browser Panel after you click Import.
4. Once you've watched how it plays, you can adjust the Frame Rate by right-clicking the Sequence in the Project Browser and selecting Interpret Footage > Main.
5. To update your time-lapse, modify the Frame Rate setting and click OK.

![import images into after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-images-into-after-effects.jpg)

## Step 3\. Create movements

1. After Effects' Time-Lapse Sequence can be used just like any other standalone clip. This implies that you may give your time-lapse clip movement by adding Keyframes and Effects.
2. Place your Playhead at the beginning of the clip after choosing the Image Sequence. Make a keyframe for the scale or position.
3. To generate a second Keyframe for the value of your choice, move to the end of the clip. Make any necessary Clip modifications.
4. Right-click on the timeline, choose New > Adjustment Layer, then add your effects to the Adjustment Layer to add effects like noise and grain.

## Step 4\. Create slow motion from a video

You can import your video after you've shot it to prepare it for editing. The same steps, including naming your photos in order, must be taken for the Time Lapse sequence. It may be advantageous to entirely rename both your Image Sequence and Performer clip.

1. Drag the finished Time Lapse sequence to your Timeline after completing it as previously explained.
2. Over the Time Lapse, add the Performer Clip to the Timeline.
3. Choose Time>Time Stretch by performing a right-click on the performer clip.
4. You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

## Step 5\. Make an overlay

You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

1. Find Luma Key in the Effect Control Panel and drag it to your clip.
2. Change the Key Type setting in the Effect Control Panel to Key Out Brighter.
3. The Threshold, Tolerance, and Edge settings should be adjusted until only the silhouette is visible.
4. Use the Pen or Mask Tool to create a circle around the parts you want to delete if you discover any corners of your clip that are still visible.
5. Add any Effects, such as Light Leaks, to your Adjustment Layer by choosing "Right-click > New > Adjustment layer."

![make an overlay after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-an-overlay-after-effects.jpg)

After Effects CC must be opened, a new project must be created, the Import File menu option must be selected, and the appropriate folder containing the altered still images must be located and selected before the time-lapse photos can be turned into a film. You need to make sure that the JPEG Series box is checked, as well as the Force Alphabetical Order box.

Once you have clicked on the first image in the sequence. The time-lapse video that you uploaded appears in the project library. After performing a right-click on the filename, select "New Comp from Selection" from the context menu.

## Step 6\. Exporting your video

After getting our sequence to perform some kind of slow, understated animation so that it appears as though the camera is moving dramatically, we will need to export a video file. Go to File > Export > Add to Render Queue, then open the Render Queue dialog box by going to Window > Render Queue. From there, you can choose the Output Module and change the settings in the options dialog box. Finally, choose the Output To option and select the location on your computer where you would like to save the video clip that we are currently rendering and exporting.

![add to render queue after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-to-render-queue-after-effects.jpg)

## Conclusion

No matter how you make your time lapse videos, After Effects has a ton of features you can use to modify and enhance the way they look. Now that you are familiar with the fundamentals, you can play with the Frame Rates and Composition options.

The best way to add a video on Android devices is to use third-party apps. The good news is that there are several very useful video editing apps that you can use for this purpose. In this guide, we will show you how you can add text to a video on Android using two of the most effective solution.

**Using the PowerDirector by Cyberlink**

PowerDirector is a video editing app that allows you to edit various aspects of the video including adding text to the video. Available on the Google Play Store, this app has a wealth of additional features that include trimming, rotating clips, and even adjusting the color, brightness, and saturation.

Here's how you can use PowerDirector to add text to your video;

Step1Install PowerDirector on your device. Open it and tap “New Project” at the top. Select an aspect ratio depending on the video project you are working on and enter a project name.

Step3Select the video layer and then tap on the layer mask from the left sidebar. Select the text tab at the top and then choose the text style that you want to add to the video. Tap on the “+” button inside the style to add the text style you have selected.

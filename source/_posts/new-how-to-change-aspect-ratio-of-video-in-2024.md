## Easy Steps to Create Intro Video with After Effects

![create intro video after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-intro-video-after-effects.jpg)

It's difficult to make an intro in After Effects. To start, you must have a natural beginning that will catch the

viewer's attention in the film you've made right away. Then, you can improve the caliber of your intros by using built-in filters, transition effects, overlays, animation, and more! Therefore, we're confident that this article will be helpful to you if you've been trying to learn how to create After Effects intros of the highest level. Continue reading to learn more.

Let's start off!

## 1\. Create a new composition for your intro

You must build up your video's composition based on the output. You can upload the previously recorded video after choosing the composition and the runtime. Right-click again and select "Pre-compose" from the menu that appears. To make it simpler to find later, you can also rename your movie here.

The composition can then include a solid layer. Follow \*Layer > New > Solid\* to get to this option. Additionally,

you can choose a hue based on the type of video you want to make. Additionally, you may use the Text option to build text layers, which will allow you to split the words at different points in the document. You can edit each word separately when you break it into layers. Finally, you can move the text around and change the color of the reader to make it more appropriate for your films.

After Effects makes it incredibly simple to edit the text composition and import it into the timeline of the film.

A panel appears on the right after importing a text composition. Here, you can alter the text's color, position,

and size.

## 2\. Add the first transition layer

By include the transition layer, you may use After Effects' effects templates to apply a variety of effects to your

videos. You can experiment with a variety of transition layers in After Effects before selecting the ideal one (CC Light Wipe is a popular choice).

You can modify the transition after applying it to the layer. For instance, you may decide to apply the second

key transition at a later period in the timeline and configure the first key transition to occur immediately at the start of the timeline. Setting the completion value is crucial since it will influence how long the word will remain displayed in the video.

## 3\. Add the second transition layer

The transition effect you introduced in the first stage can either be maintained here, or you can select an

entirely different one. According to how long you want the text to be displayed, add the layer and adjust

completion. The reader is invisible when the completion value is set to 100%, or the word is said when it is set

to 0%.

**A memory sketch**

If you want to make a black-and-white video that is more interesting, the memory sketch is a great template to use. You can make a visually beautiful video with its outstanding text captions, fluid transitions, and excellent animations.

**Toolkit for Instagram**

These days, Instagram is a very popular social media site. Instagram is a platform where reels and videos

flourish, therefore you must make every effort to differentiate your video from the millions of others available.

The Instagram Toolkit template meets the standards of the social media network by being brief, clear, and

appealing.

**Lighting sweep**

A final transition effect, which can be found in the \*Effects > Generate \*section, must be added to the video in order to complete the effect. The final flourish can be added in the same way as the other keyframes. In this step, you can use the edge intensity, sweep intensity, and direction. This allows you to seamlessly combine the transition of words with lighting effects.

These are some quick and easy techniques to adding some intros to your videos that look professional. Let's

also take a look at some well-known templates you may utilize to make perfect video intros. Because the initial few seconds of any video are so important, After Effects has put together some incredible templates that have a variety of video clips, images, text, sound effects, and music tracks. To produce the video you want, you must obtain the ideal template.

## The Bottom Line

Utilizing templates will hasten your workflow even though it takes some time to become familiar with After

Effects' various tools. To gain a feel for how After Effects functions, we advise playing around by adding some

clips and titles. When you do that, you will be well on your way to creating a fantastic intro for your upcoming

video project.

When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.

**●** **Clock Tool**

The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.

Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.

**Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio**

Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.

To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.

**Step 6: Share Your Presentation**

Run a mock slideshow in the ‘Preview’ box to ensure that every element of the presentation is at its specified place. When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.

## Part 3 In What Way Could You Edit Your Video Shortly?

Creating **slideshow iMovie** presentations is a creative task and everything comes on the line with the finesse of editing skills to evoke an intelligent play with features, tools and effects. While you can master the art with consistent effort and practice, there are some really cool tips and tricks to quickly edit and uplift iMovie presentations.

Let us have a look at a few of the most prominent ones in the following section before you move ahead to **create slideshow in iMovie**:

### 01Cool Ways to Quickly Edit Your iMovie Videos

**●** **Crop to Zoon in the Video**

When editing your videos in the iMovie software, you can zoom in a desired portion of the video frame. All you need to do is, select a clip, tap on the ‘Crop’ button at the top right corner over the ‘Preview’ box, choose the ‘Crop to Fill’ option and drag the effect to the specific clip area you wish to crop. Apply your changes by clicking inside the checkbox at the top right corner.

**●** **Split a Clip**

You can reduce the size of a sufficiently long video clip by choosing to break the same into several parts or trim it to ward off unwanted portions. To split your footage, take your cursor to the specific splitting point of the clip within the editor timeline, make a right click, and select the ‘Split Clip’ option from the dropdown menu that follows next.

**●** **Detach an Audio File**

Detaching audio from a clip allows you to experiment with different video play options. You can let the run the in the background as you proceed to split a clip for inserting a still image. To work with the effect, navigate to and right click on a desired clip within the editor timeline and tap on ‘Detach Audio’ in the upcoming list of options. The added music clip in ’Blue’ will detach to appear as an independent clip in ‘Green’ within the software timeline.

**●** **Fade Audio In and Out**

To ensure a smooth audio transition between successive clips, try hands at fading the audio in and out by pointing the cursor at a detached green or an attached blue audio clip, followed by dragging the small round circles at the beginning or end of the footage. To introduce a gradual fade in or out effect, drag the round button to the center of the video clip.

**●** **Include Transitions**

Transitions allow a seamless presentation flow by ensuring a smooth movement between different slides appearing in continuity. Add a suitable transition element to the video footage of your slideshow by navigating to and hitting the ‘Transition’ tab in the ‘Functions Toolbar’. The default transition screen time is 1 second, but you can customize the same by double clicking on the effect post the latter’s addition within the editor timeline.

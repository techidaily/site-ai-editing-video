## So, without Further Dilly-Dallying, Let’s Learn How to Create a Retro 1950-Style Video with This Simple Filmora Tutorial

So, what's the difference between a vintage film shot in the 1920s and 1950s? It's simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let's learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.

## Preparation

![1950 vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1950-vintage-scene.gif)

Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn't need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It's even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent's collection.

How to create a 1950s vintage film:

##### Step 1 Add your video on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![add your video on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-1.jpg)

First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.

##### Step 2 Apply a cropping effect to the video

![apply a cropping effect to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-2.jpg)

Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and choose the **Crop** effect under the **Utility** folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.

![click the effect tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-3.jpg)

Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.

##### Step 3 Add a Warm Film color effect

![add a warm film color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-4.jpg)

Up to here, you'll realize that your video doesn't still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the **3D LUT** option under the **Color** category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose **Warm Film**. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.

##### Step 4 Apply more graininess to the film

![apply more graininess to the film](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-5.jpg)

Please don't stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the **Overlay** menu under the Effects tab, then click **Old Film**. After that, choose the **Random Dust, Dirty Film,** and **Subtle Grain** effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.

## Summary

And that's all there is today! With these steps, you can create an engaging 1950s film without breaking a sweat on Filmora. Remember to visit our other vintage tutorials to learn how to create a film recorded in the 20s, 80s, and 90s. Happy editing, everyone!

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**AVIDEMUX**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-25.jpg)

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Features:**

* Multiple Formats
* Video Filters
* Advanced Interlacing
* Full Editing Control
* Simple Interface
* Open Source

**Pros:**

* Covers standard formats.
* All essential features are present.
* Surprisingly advanced filtering, processing, editing, and filtering controls.
* The interface is easy to learn.
* Open-source

**Cons:**

* The interface is very legacy and needs remodeling
* No longer updated
* No support

**Steps On How To Cut Videos On Avidemux:**

1. Open up Avidemux, and load the video file that you want to work with. If you get a prompt like this one: we recommend clicking Yes to use the safer mode.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-26.jpg)

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-27.jpg)

1. Find the portion of the video that you’d like to isolate. Get as close as you can to the start of the clip you want to cut.

1. You want it to read I; if it isn’t framed type I, then use the single left and right arrow buttons to go forward or backward one frame until you find an appropriate I frame.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-28.jpg)

1. Once you’ve found the right starting frame, click the button with the A over a red bar. This will set the start of the clip.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-29.jpg)

1. Advance to where you want your clip to end. Click on the button with a B when you’ve found the appropriate frame. This frame can be of any type.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-30.jpg)

**BEST PAID FFMPEG ALTERNATIVE TO CUT VIDEO ON MAC**

**JOYOSHARE MEDIA CUTTER**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-31.jpg)

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

The best video cutting tool is Joyoshare Media Cutter for Windows (or Mac). As a professional video trimmer, it allows you to cut your media files at a 60X faster rate, allowing you to clip a 60-minute video or audio file in just one minute. The interface design is also simple and clean, allowing you to do it quickly.

Another noteworthy feature is the ability to easily cut and merge both video and audio without sacrificing quality. The cropper supports a variety of video and audio formats, including AVI, MP4, MPEG, VOB, WMV, ASF, RM, RMVB, 3GP, MP3, WMA, M4R, and others, allowing you to save the file in any format and on any device, including Apple.

More notably, this is a capable all-in-one video cutter. In addition to cutting videos and audio, it can convert all popular video formats, extract audio from video files, and merge video and audio files from the same source into a new one.

**Features:**

### Convert to Any File Format

### Merge Video and Audio Files into Multiple Formats

### Improved Accuracy & Efficiency in Cutting Videos

### 60X Fast Conversion

**Pros:**

* Offers an easy way to cut, merge, and convert video files
* Blazing fast video-cutting and file-conversion speed
* Supports multiple audio and video file formats

**Cons:**

* Can only merge videos from the same source. That means you can’t use the program to merge separate videos from your gallery.
* The program doesn’t offer an easy way to remove an unwanted part of a video if it’s in the middle of the video. The only way to do that is by cutting the section before and after the video, then merging them into one.

**Steps:**

### **Step 1: Adding Video**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-32.jpg)

To add a video, click the “**Open**” button. Locate the video you want to trim from your collection and open it. Alternatively, you can use the drag-and-drop feature.

### **Step 2: Select the Segment to Be Trimmed**

At the bottom of the Joyoshare video window, you’ll be able to see a time slider through which you can skip to your desired timeframe. Move the slider handles attached to the yellow timeline bar to set the starting and ending points of your video.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-33.jpg)

Once you’ve set your desired starting point, click on the “\[” button to highlight the starting segment, then move the right-hand slider to select the ending point, and click the \] button to set the end segment.

### **Step 3: Choose Your Desired Output Format and Destination Folder**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-34.jpg)

Click the “Format” button, and a new window will pop up where you’ll be able to choose your preferred output format.

### **Step 4: Trim the Video**

Click the “Start” button to begin trimming the segment. Wait for a minute for the program to finalize trimming the segment, then click the save button. That’s it! You’ve successfully trimmed your first video.

If you wish to cut and merge several segments, click the “+” icon at the bottom of the segments tab, then follow the above procedure to create several segments.

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID VIDEO CUTTER ON MAC?**

Whether you choose Free or Paid Video Cutter, it still depends on your edit and navigation if the project will succeed like what you’re anticipating. Beginners in the industry can go for Free Video Cutters to practice the craft without worrying about the monthly subscription.

However, if you’re a professional, I highly suggest that you choose Paid Video Cutter to lessen the hassle and create amazing output.

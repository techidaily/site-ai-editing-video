**Using Wonder Share Filmora 11.**

The rising tendency toward making the Tik Tok videos has proven that filmmaking is not difficult but the emerging number of professional video editors has made it more simple. Tik Tok is the fastest growing and amazing social media platform so one should make sure to make a video that stands out from the crowd. For this, I am introducing a very professional but easy-to-use application **“Wonder Share Filmora 11”.**

Filmora 11 is one of the most powerful video editors and allows you to edit videos from smartphones, DSLRs, and all types of digital cameras. It provides hundreds of eye-catching visual and audio effects.

#### **Adding a photo to the Tik Tok video.**

Before you start the editing process, organize your **Media Library**. Most of the time our library is flooded with excess pictures and it consumes a lot of time to select the right photos. However, it is not a compulsory step but you can do it to enjoy your editing. So let’s get started!

* Open the **Filmora 11** and click on the **New Project.**
* **Import** the video file and the photo you want to add. You can drag and drop the image and click on the Import button to get the image.

![add-photo-tiktok-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/add-photo-tiktok-video-16.jpg)

* Set the same **Aspect Ratio** and **Resolution** for both the video and the image.
* Drag the video and drop it into the timeline.
* Now drag the image and drop it above the video track.

In the above screenshot, you can see the image is added to the video. You can further edit it to set it in the proper position you want.

* Drag the image in the timeline and place it at the point you want.
* You can extend or cut the length of the image.
* In the same way, you can directly resize your image in the preview window.
* Drag the edge of the photo and resize it. You can also move it to adjust the placement of the image.

## How to Create Vintage Film Effect 1950S

So, what's the difference between a vintage film shot in the 1920s and 1950s? It's simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let's learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.

## Preparation

![1950 vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1950-vintage-scene.gif)

Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn't need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It's even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent's collection.

How to create a 1950s vintage film:

##### Step 1 Add your video on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![add your video on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-1.jpg)

First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.

##### Step 2 Apply a cropping effect to the video

![apply a cropping effect to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-2.jpg)

Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and choose the **Crop** effect under the **Utility** folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.

![click the effect tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-3.jpg)

Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.

##### Step 3 Add a Warm Film color effect

![add a warm film color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-4.jpg)

Up to here, you'll realize that your video doesn't still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the **3D LUT** option under the **Color** category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose **Warm Film**. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.

##### Step 4 Apply more graininess to the film

![apply more graininess to the film](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-5.jpg)

Please don't stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the **Overlay** menu under the Effects tab, then click **Old Film**. After that, choose the **Random Dust, Dirty Film,** and **Subtle Grain** effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.

And that's all there is today! With these steps, you can create an engaging 1950s film without breaking a sweat on Filmora. Remember to visit our other vintage tutorials to learn how to create a film recorded in the 20s, 80s, and 90s. Happy editing, everyone!

Step 2: Then, click on the "Strip" menu and select "Transform."

In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.

Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.

Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.

Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:

\- Scale the video up or down

\- Flip the video horizontally or vertically

\- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport

To rotate a video clip using keyframes...

Step 1: Import the video clip you want to rotate to your project.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-7.png)

Step 2: In the timeline, place the playhead at the beginning of the clip.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-8.png)

Step 3: With the playhead still at the beginning of the clip, drag the rotation handle in the preview window to rotate the video.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-9.png)

Step 4: Move the playhead to the end of the clip and drag the rotation handle again to rotate it further.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-10.png)

To rotate a video clip using the Transform Tool...

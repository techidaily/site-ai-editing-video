## What is Masking?

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage.

The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.

Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos.

Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.

Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.

Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.

Masking video editing is the process of hiding or obscuring certain elements in a video clip. This can be done for aesthetic purposes and is often used to remove unwanted objects or blemishes from the footage. Masking can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.

## What is Masking?

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage. The mask is the portion of the video you've chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.

Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!

### Different types of masking

There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.

Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.

Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.

Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.

## Want to Convert MP4 Video To 60 FPS GIF? Read This

GIFs have become a popular way to share short and engaging videos online. They are widely used on social media platforms and messaging apps, making it easy to share moments, reactions, and emotions with friends and family. But not all GIFs are created equal. Some GIFs can look choppy and low-quality, detracting from the viewing experience.

To improve the quality of your GIFs, you can convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS (frames per second). This will give your GIFs a smooth, fluid motion that looks professional and visually appealing. In this article, we'll go over the steps you need to follow to convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS GIFs and create high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.

![convert mp4 video to 60 fps gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-mp4-video-60-fps-gif.JPG)

## Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?

GIFs are a great way to share short, eye-catching videos online, but not all are made the same. GIFs with low frame rates tend to look choppy, and the motion could be smoother, making the video look unprofessional and detracting from the overall viewing experience. On the other hand, GIFs with higher frame rates look smoother, and the motion is more fluid, making the video more visually appealing.

Converting your MP4 videos to GIFs has several benefits:

* **Smoother Motion:** By converting MP4s to GIFs, you increase the frame rate of your GIFs, giving them a smoother and more fluid motion.
* **Increased Detail:** Higher frame rates allow for more detail and clarity in fast-moving scenes, making the video more engaging and easier to watch.
* **Reduced Ghosting:** A higher frame rate reduces the "ghosting" effect in low-frame rate GIFs, making the video clearer and reducing distractions.
* **High-Quality Videos:** Converting MP4s to GIFs eliminates the ghosting effect and creates high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.
* **Increased Engagement:** High-quality GIFs will engage and entertain your audience, making them more likely to share and interact with your content.

Converting MP4s to GIFs is a great way to improve the overall quality of your GIFs and create visually appealing videos that are perfect for sharing online. Whether you're sharing a reaction, a moment, or an emotion, a high-quality GIF will engage and entertain your audience.

### Can I Get a 60 FPS GIF?

While it's true that many people search for 60 FPS GIFs, it's important to understand that there is no such thing as a true 60 FPS GIF.

![60 fps gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-gif.jpg)

GIFs are an image format designed to display simple animations. [GIF files store delay time between frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) which is defined as multiples of 1/100th of a second. Value 1 would give you 100 FPS; value 2 would already have half of 100 FPS, that is, 50 FPS; value 3 would give you 33.3 FPS GIF, etc. So there are 20 FPS GIFs, 33.3 FPS GIFs, 50 FPS GIFs, and 100 FPS GIFs.

In addition, many websites or programs (including Google Chrome) ignore value 1 (100 FPS GIFs) and default to a much slower animation speed when viewing GIF files. Therefore, 100 FPS GIFs are technically possible but are rarely used. Value 2 (50 FPS) is the most you can get.

If you want to create high-quality animations, consider using MP4s or alternative image formats better suited for high frame rates and detailed animations.

That being said, some websites may have a "60 FPS GIFs" category, but it's important to understand that most of the content in these categories is not 60 FPS. Instead, it's likely to be either an MP4 video or a GIF with a lower frame rate, like 50 FPS, labeled as "60 FPS" for marketing purposes.

## Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?

Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 60 FPS GIF maker. As mentioned before, there is no 60 FPS GIF, so it is impossible to create a 60 FPS GIF using traditional methods. However, many excellent video-to-GIF converters in the market allow you to set the GIF frame rate.

These video-to-GIF converters allow you to convert MP4 videos to GIFs with a higher frame rate, which can give your GIFs a smoother and more fluid motion. While these GIFs may not be 60 FPS, they can still provide a significant quality improvement compared to traditional GIFs.

## People Also Ask

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:

#### Q1\. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?

It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n/100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1/100 second (100 FPS), 2/100 second (50 FPS), 3/100 second (33.33 FPS), 4/100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333.../100 second (30 FPS).

#### Q2\. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?

To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.

#### Q3\. What FPS Should a GIF Be?

GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it's possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.

#### Q4\. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?

The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.

## Conclusion

GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.

There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.

## People Also Ask

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:

#### Q1\. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?

It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n/100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1/100 second (100 FPS), 2/100 second (50 FPS), 3/100 second (33.33 FPS), 4/100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333.../100 second (30 FPS).

#### Q2\. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?

To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.

#### Q3\. What FPS Should a GIF Be?

GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it's possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.

#### Q4\. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?

The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.

## Conclusion

GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.

There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.

## Part 2: Some Quick Alternatives to Efectum App for Slowing Down Videos

Efectum is undoubtedly a good platform to change video speed with other editing options. Some users might find it boring and get annoyed due to the watermark it locates in videos. They want an alternative to the **Efectum app download without a watermark**. Thus, in this section, we have enlisted the current best replacements for Efectum that are worth trying.

* [FXMotion Slow Fast Video Maker](#alternative1)
* [CapCut - Video Editor](#alternative2)
* [InVideo](#alternative3)
* [VN-Video Editor & Maker](#alternative4)
* [InShot Video Editor & Maker](#alternative5)

### 1\. FXMotion Slow Fast Video Maker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/fxmotion-slow-fast-video-maker/id1559517301))

If you are unsatisfied with the **Efectum app** for limited speed adjustments, try this app. It is designed to change video speed in your own way with the speed graph. You can create a slow-motion video of up to 0.1x speed and a fast motion of up to 10x speed. With high-quality resolution output, it serves quick response. This application lets you share the edited video with friends on social media.

![fxmotion slow fast video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-5.jpg)

 Pros

* Allow choosing output quality from 480p and 1080p resolution options.
* Provides a music library to add thrill or sensation to slow-down videos.

 Cons

* Restrict you just to change speed and does not offer any feature for video editing.

### 2\. CapCut - Video Editor ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/capcut-video-editor/id1500855883)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemon.lvoverseas&hl=en&gl=US))

It’s a popular video editor with advanced editing and pre-designed video templates. This platform offers built-in fonts, effects, and stickers to add creativity to your content. Furthermore, CapCut provides you with Chroma key, stabilization, and Keyframe animation options. Besides these advanced features, you can alter video speed from 0.1x to 10x. Also, it lets you add a speed curve for a smooth, slow motion.

![capcut video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-6.jpg)

 Pros

* Add auto-caption and lyrics in videos with speech recognition ability.
* Extract audio clips or add sound effects from a rich music library.

 Cons

* It does not offer exporting in frame rate higher than 60fps.

### 3\. InVideo ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.filmrapp.videoeditor&hl=en&gl=US))

Instead of an **Efectum app download,** discover possibilities with InVideo. This app is an expert in creating aesthetic stop motions, ads, reels, and tutorials. It can speed up and speed down your clips. In addition, you can make a boomerang of shots and add cinematic transitions in clips. From its extensive music library, users can add music or import voiceovers.

![invideo video slow motion app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-7.jpg)

 Pros

* Utilize over 150 stickers, filters, and text templates to level up your projects.
* Record new footage with a built-in 60fps frame rate and 4k resolution.

 Cons

* The best footage stock and other assets are reserved for subscribed users.

### 4\. VN-Video Editor & Maker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/is/app/vn-video-editor/id1343581380)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frontrow.vlog&hl=en&gl=US))

If searching for an alternative like the **Efectum app, download without the watermark**; use this app. It satisfies the needs of professionals and amateur video editors with high-quality videos. VN’s speed curve is more like Adobe Premiere Pro’s speed ramping. Thus, you can adjust the playback of your video with 6-speed adjustment curves.

![vn video editor and maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-8.jpg)

 Pros

* It enables you to freeze frames, reverse videos, and add keyframe animations.

Another good option in place of the **Efectum app** that you can consider is InShot. This platform offers some AI features such as auto-caption, smart tracking, and AI effects. InShot enables you to make smooth slow-mo with a speed ramping feature and keyframe editing. Plus, you can create multi-layered videos with filters, transitions, and AI effects.

![video editor and maker inshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-9.jpg)

 Pros

* Make photo collages with AI effects and blend screenshots with AI context recognition.
* Export videos in 4K resolution to YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp.

 Cons

* Impose a watermark on videos unless you pay to remove it, which annoys many users.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

**Step 5: Include Animation Keyframes**

Proceed to add animation keyframes on the specific clip. Right-click on it and select “Add Animation” from the menu. Proceed into the “Animation” tab and find the “Customize” section across the screen. Move the indicator to the point where you want to add the first keyframe and hit “Add.” Move the indicator further across the clip to add the second keyframe across it. The reason for adding multiple keyframes is to set up the animation keyframe across the TikTok clip.

**Step 6: Change the Scale Clip and Export**

Locate the “Scale” option among them and manage the scaling of the clip through the slider percentages. Once done, click on the "Export" button to download the edited TikTok.

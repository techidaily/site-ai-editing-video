## Have You Ever Watched YouTube Live Streams? In Fact, You Can Also Start a Live Streaming on YouTube if You Want. Here We’ll Share some Tips to Live Stream on YouTube

Maybe you already heard of the word live streaming people use in different social media platforms. Whether it is about something that you want your audiences to participate in, or whether you want to sell something, to discuss something or even to showcase something to the virtual world. If you’re a YouTuber like me, you can definitely go on live streaming on your YouTube Channel. But before we go ahead and broadcast ourselves on YouTube, let’s first discuss what is live streaming for you to have an idea beforehand.

Live streaming is a streaming media simultaneously recorded and broadcast in real-time over the internet. It is often referred to simply as streaming. Non-live media such as video-on-demand, vlogs and YouTube videos are technically are streamed, but not live streamed. Live stream services encompass a wide variety of topics, from social media to video games (e.g., overwatch) to professional sports. Platform such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, and Instagram can be one of your biggest choices to showcase any of your talent.

## How to go on Live on YouTube?

* Go to your YouTube Channel.
* On the upper left corner of your Channel, click the video icon and you’ll see the word “Create”. Click it.

![click create youtube channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-create-youtube-channel.jpg)

* Next is you’ll see a drop-down box, choose Go Live.

![choose go live youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-go-live-youtube.jpg)

* And since I’m not using the live streaming a very long time ago, I was amazed that it has now options that you can choose from. Whether you want to go on live right away, or you can pick up the time where you’re most comfortable with.

![choose live stream time youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-live-stream-time-youtube.jpg)

* I chose the second one since we’re not going on live at this very moment. As you can see in the image below. There you have options to choose from. Whether to use the built-in webcam of your laptop or the computer you’re using or you can use a personal computer screen recorder like OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software). I already break down the whereabouts of this particular screen recorder on my previous article. But, let me just discuss you a little bit, maybe it’ll be helpful if you want to go on live with a more powerful and engaging live streaming.

![select camera device youtube live](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-camera-device-youtube-live.jpg)

## What is OBS Studio?

Open Broadcaster Software or OBS Studio is s free, open-source and cross-platform screencasting and streaming app. It is available for windows, macOS, Linux distributions, and BSD. OBS Studio provides real-time capture, encoding and broadcasting for YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, Instagram and many other social media platforms. You can download the application itself for FREE.

![download obs studio software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/download-obs-studio-software.jpg)

* If you’re a rookie and you want to go on live for the very first time, YouTube provides the step-by-step process. But if you’re already a pro when it comes to live streaming, then you can always choose the use of a screen recorder software because it has many useful tools for you to offer. You just need to learn it firsthand.

Next step, you just need to click the “Allow” button and you’re ready to the next step.

![enable camera and microphone youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-camera-and-microphone-youtube.jpg)

* You just need to simplify what is your live stream all about. Make a catchy title so that your audiences will be curious and will wait for you to be on live. Be specific with your description and find a topic that will be helpful to others. You know, everyone’s time is gold. We need to make the most out of it.

![adjust stream settings youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjust-stream-settings-youtube.jpg)

* I changed the Title and the Description as an example and the thumbnail as well. You can edit it when you continue to scroll down. You'll choose what kind of category it fits in. If you want, you can also add it to your Playlist and you’ll choose your audience, if it’s suitable for kids or not.

![create stream details](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-details.jpg)

* And since my YouTube Channel was already monetized, I have the options to monetize the live streaming too.

![create stream monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-monetization.jpg)

* As what it says, you need to customize the live stream according to your preference.

![create stream customization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-customization.jpg)

* And the final step before you can actually go on live, you will choose the visibility of your live broadcast. Usually, most of the people choose **_Public_** located at the bottom area of the options listed in the image below.

![create stream visibility](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-visibility.jpg)

* The image below shows how it looks like after you click the “DONE” button. And the only thing that you need is to click the “GO LIVE” button and everyone can participate on your live streaming.

![go live on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/go-live-on-youtube.jpg)

And here's an actual example of a Live streaming that I’ve already done before on my YouTube Channel. I used OBS Studio in presenting the information that I needed, to convey the message to the audiences that are interested in learning Hebrew language to be exact.

![record youtube live stream](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/record-youtube-live-stream.jpg)

During the live streaming, you can see people interacting with you on live and that’s totally awesome!

**Live streaming is essential for your YouTube Channel success for two main reasons:**

1. You can minimize the part of editing a raw vlog and that is time consuming, you can just click the “Go Live” button and follow all the required steps and you can share all your ideas through everyone who will watch your live streaming. You can exchange thoughts, interact with them right away. You can also enhance your speaking skills in front of the camera. A very much needed ability if you want to be a YouTuber like us.
2. If you’re a newbie in vlogging, YouTube set its requirements for you to be their YouTube Partner; which includes 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours (240,000 minutes). So, if you want to get pass above it as fast as you could, YouTube livestreaming could be the best key to achieve it. Imagine you're going to be on live for about 3 hours in a row, so that’s 180 minutes already.

To sum it up, if you’re someone who wants to share your ability to the virtual world out there; then YouTube platform can be one of your go-to-stage. You can also choose Facebook if you want to target large audiences. Although YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, I think Facebook are a way ahead when it comes to reaching potential viewers or audiences because Facebook statistics show that more than two billion users have an account, 65 million businesses have Facebook pages and advertisers are crazy about it. Most of our friends and relatives are on Facebook. And that’s freaking insane. So, what are you waiting for, choose your social platform and GO ON LIVE!

## How to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro

In order to make it simple to combine the shot's components into a sequence, video overlays are pieces of film that are often recorded in a dark studio. Using image overlays on a video production is fairly frequent. However, adding pictures to every video you export might be tiresome and time-consuming if you have several films to send. For instance, an overlay video in Premiere Pro might be preferred by you rather than a manual addition of the overlay media.

There is a quick and easy method to know how to overlay a video on a video in Premiere Pro and we’ve got it covered. However, depending on the kind of element, there may be some color blending that affects the components themselves. Overlays may be filmed on either a green screen or a blue screen. Snow components photographed against a green screen may have a green hue shift, necessitating further color grading before the footage might be used.

## Part 1\. How to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro

Videos sometimes need a splash of color to elevate them. With the built-in color effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, you can apply overlays to any video, whether you want to add a little drama to a clip or a splash of color to a social media post. We'll demonstrate how to overlay videos in this article. To liven up your intros, make your outros stand out, and spruce up your summer social media posts, add a gradient video overlay effect. Adobe Premiere Pro and gorgeous video clips are all you need.

**Steps to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro**

##### Step1Activate Premiere Pro

To build a new sequence, start a new project in Premiere, import your footage, then drag your clip onto the timeline. The clip's parameters will be reflected in the sequence.

![activitate premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/activitate-premiere-pro.jpg)

##### Step2Select Overlay Effect

Secondly, choose the Effects workspace (located near the top of your window). This will guarantee that the tools we need are accessible. Alternately, you may go to Window > Workspaces > Effects.

![select overlay effects pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-overlay-effects-pr.jpg)

##### Step3Create a layer of adjustments

Go to File > New > Adjustment Layer to begin. Make sure your Project panel is chosen if the option is not accessible. Your clip and sequence will show up in your Project panel with the adjustment layer. Add the timeline with the adjustment layer selected.

![create a layer adjustment pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-layer-adjustment-pr.jpg)

##### Step4Create the Video Overlay

Transitions, generators, audio effects, and video effects are all included under the Effects panel. We'll begin by selecting the 4-Color Gradient from the "Generate" folder, which contains generators for patterns and gradients, to produce the video overlay effect. Right-click on the adjustment layer in the timeline and drag the appropriate effect there.

![create the video overlay pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-the-video-overlay-pr.jpg)

##### Step5Change the Effect Control

In the Effect Controls panel, you may manage and adjust effects. You may change the default effect settings for each element in your timeline, such as size and opacity, under the Effect Controls panel along with any additional effects you've added. To access an item's effect controls, click on it in the timeline.

![change effects control pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/change-effects-control-pr.jpg)

By selecting the ‘Show all properties’ next to the adjustment layer in your timeline, you can get a before-and-after comparison. Increase the value by selecting "blend with original." To change the effect's strength, move this up and down.

##### Step6Save the Project

Try switching the linear mode to radial. You can make a color transition for circles by doing this. You will be able to highlight various things with color after this transition. The circle's starting point may be animated to follow a certain item in the scene.

![save the project pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/save-the-project-pr.jpg)

To the right of the Presets drop-down menu, choose the Auto Save button. Check the Save Effects Settings box when the Choose a Name dialog box appears. Future exports made with this preset will automatically take into account any Image Overlay settings you've configured.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Features:**

* Multiple Formats
* Video Filters
* Advanced Interlacing
* Full Editing Control
* Simple Interface
* Open Source

**Pros:**

* Covers standard formats.
* All essential features are present.
* Surprisingly advanced filtering, processing, editing, and filtering controls.
* The interface is easy to learn.
* Open-source

**Cons:**

* The interface is very legacy and needs remodeling
* No longer updated

More notably, this is a capable all-in-one video cutter. In addition to cutting videos and audio, it can convert all popular video formats, extract audio from video files, and merge video and audio files from the same source into a new one.

Adding titles and texts to a video clip during the post-production phase is a common thing. You may need to add texts in the intro and outro of the video as well as to highlight important parts in the middle of the video.

There are different types of font effects available to apply to the texts and titles in your video. There are premium video editors available with a wide range of effects such as After Effect font effects. If you are an occasional video creator, you can use online font effects while you edit your videos on the go. We will illustrate how to add font effects to videos on any device.

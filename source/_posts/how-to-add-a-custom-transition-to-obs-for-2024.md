## How to Add a Custom Transition to OBS

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.

Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.

![apply cut transition effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg)

Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.

![select transition point field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg)

Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.

1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\. Otherwise, you can do various editings on the video like cropping, muting, trimming, animating, etc. before resizing the video. Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

1. **Adjust the file size of the video through export settings**

After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the **_Export_** button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

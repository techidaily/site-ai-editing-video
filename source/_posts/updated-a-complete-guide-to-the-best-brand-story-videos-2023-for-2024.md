## A Complete Guide to the Best Brand Story Videos |2023|

With the advent of streaming content accessible anytime, anywhere, conventional marketing has somewhat lost grip on its performance. Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.

However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.

This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their **brand storytelling**. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray **your brand story** than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.

Modern-day consumers are much more educated and sophisticated than before. You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their **branding and storytelling** strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own **brand storytelling video** and are wondering how to make it a successful one.

Take no worries as the further sections will clear all your doubts and give you the perfect answer. So, let’s start.

## Part 1 Why Sometimes Transparent Gif is Hard to Remove

When the GIF looks ugly with a transparent background, it becomes necessary to remove the background. But it sometimes becomes hard as this requires proper skills as well as adequate tools to achieve this. In the absence of even one, the final output may come out to be clumsy. There are many tools that can be used to remove the background from a **transparent animated GIF**. But it is hard to use these tools without proper knowledge. If you learn the skills, the task becomes so easy.

## Part 2 How to Remove the Background from an Animated Gif in Photoshop

Photoshop is popularly known for being a photo manipulation and editing software. But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.

**Step 1: Import The GIF File**

This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the "File" menu of Photoshop. Then tap on "Open" and double click on the desired GIF file.

![import file photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Set Up The Project**

It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (**gif remove bg**). For this:

Find the "Video Group" option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the "Ungroup layers" option.

![ungroup video photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg)

This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on "layer 1" and tap on the "Convert to smart object" option. Again right-click on "Layer 1" and click on "Edit Contents".

You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.

**Step 3: Begin The Editing Part**

Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.

For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.

To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.

**Step 4: Delete The Transparent GIF Background**

Now, delete the background of each frame of your GIF. To delete the background of any particular frame, click on that frame. For this, you can either use a "Quick Selection Tool" or a "Polygonal Lasso Tool". You will get the final result that will be background free.

**Step 5: Save The Project In GIF Format**

To save the GIF project, click on the "File" menu and then tap on the "Save As" option. Give a file name and select "GIF" on the "Save As Type" options menu. Then click on "OK" to save the GIF file.

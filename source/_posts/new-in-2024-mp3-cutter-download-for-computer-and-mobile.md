##### Step3Start Mirroring Zoom

The screen of your phone will show up on your TV when you tap your Chromecast. The best view is obtained by turning your phone into landscape after opening Zoom as usual. Once you place a call from here, the video will cast to your TV. Go to the next screen and click Start Broadcasting. You may now start casting to your Chromecast device by opening the Zoom Cloud Meeting app.

You must download the third-party app if you use an iPhone or iPad. The Chromecast Streamer software will let you cast a Zoom meeting on your Chromecast device as Zoom doesn't provide a casting option.

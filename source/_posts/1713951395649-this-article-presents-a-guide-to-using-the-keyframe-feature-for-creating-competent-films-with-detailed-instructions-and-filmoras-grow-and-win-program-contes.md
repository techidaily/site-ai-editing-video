## Part 1\. What is the Keyframe Feature?

A keyframe, also spelled "key frame," defines any smooth transition's beginning and conclusion. In the case of animation or film, or video, that something may be a drawing or a specific frame of a shot.

The keyframe feature creates room for boundless creativity. The Keyframe feature could imitate any illusive or fascinating impact, from object enlargement to magical power effects. A key frame is a frame that serves as a marker for the start or stop of a parameter change.

You could use a keyframe to mark the spot where the audio will have faded up or down to a specific volume.

## Part 2\. Where to Use The Keyframe Feature?

Editors and creators use keyframing for all kinds of stuff. These uses include:

### Animated Logo Intros

### Custom Picture-in-Picture Paths

We use the picture-in-picture effect in many editing formats, from tutorial videos to gaming streams and vlogs. Keyframing allows editors to execute the movement of the PIP as they wish. For instance, this video call was shot from a video.

### New Features

* **Separates the Object:** RSMB Pro has the additional capability to isolate the background and foreground effectively. It utilizes a specified matte that can help in object separation to create motion blur with great precision. (Not available with Movie Studio, Vegas Pro, Catalyst Edit, Smoke, Media Composer, Flame, or Nucoda)
* **Blur with Motion Vectors:** If you have imported a 3D animation video, the pro version can blur the motion vectors provided by you. Thus, it can work on a 3D animation system perfectly. (Not available with Vegas Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Movie Studio, Media Composer, Catalyst Edit, or Nucoda)
* **RGB+A Tracking:** This option is used to recognize and track dark images with mattes by using the alpha channel. You can use this option for masked or CG stuff. (Not available with Media Composer)
* **Use of Tracking Points:** To help the RSMB’s calculation of motion vectors, you can provide tracking points. By defining the tracking points, you can tell RSMB about the movement of one pixel from one frame to another efficiently. (Not available with Vegas Pro, Media Composer, Catalyst Edit, DaVinci Resolve, Smoke, Flame, Movie Studio, or Nucoda)
* **Spline Guidance:** If RSMB encounters problems related to tracking, you can draw and animate shapes to tell about the object's movement. Thus, it can help the RSMB find the object movement easily.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

![how to freeze-frame in After Effect 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tips-to%20freeze-frame-in%20after-effect-2.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you.

In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause.

Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.

**Create Community-Focused Content**

Planning helps you find out the resources you will need for the video. Additionally, you can use different storyboarding tools to plan the details of your political video.

At this point, you can choose to ask for external help to ensure everything goes as planned. For example, you could work with marketing experts or a political ad agency. Such external support has the experience and support to take your political campaign video to the next level.

**Step 5: Produce Your Political Campaign Video**

Now that everything needed is in place, it’s time to shoot your video. The equipment required usually depends on the style you’re looking to achieve. If you’re shooting the phone on your own, you need good lighting and a phone to pass your message successfully.

**Step 6: Edit Video with Wondershare Filmora**

You don’t want to put out a video that doesn’t look professional and isn’t optimized. A shabby-looking or improperly formatted video will draw attention from the content of the political video. Therefore, you have to use a professional editing tool like Wondershare Filmora to edit your political video. This app is relatively easy to use; its intuitive user interface allows you to navigate the app even when you have no prior editing experience. It also supports various video formats and offers over 300 effects.

* **Step 1:** Download Filmora from the official website and install it on your device. Once you launch the Filmora app, click on the ‘new project icon.’

**Step 7: Publish and Promote Your Political Campaign Video**

After editing your video, you’re ready to share it with the public. Distribute it to the appropriate channels and ensure it meets the ideal advertising rules and regulations. The best part of the campaign videos is that you can easily repurpose them to your preference. You can also share the video on social media; there are chances it will go viral.

**Step 8: Measure Your Success**

Now is the time to measure your success; how far have you achieved your goal? Use the metrics you set to determine how your video performed. This information will help you adjust and improve your political video strategy.

**Best Practices for Promoting Your Political Campaign Video**

After you upload the video, you want to ensure that it reaches your target audience and gets the kind of engagement you’re looking for. To ensure this, below are three best practices to promote your political campaign video.

**Research and Comply with Government Regulations**

Political videos fall into a specific category, and you want to make sure that you follow the rules. There are various regulations, which usually depend on the city, state, or country. Additionally, television advertisements have special rules and social media platforms. Therefore, you should ensure that you follow the rules. For example, although Twitter doesn’t allow for paid political advertisements, Facebook does.

**Fact-Check Your Video**

You don’t want to mislead your voters; they’re using the video to decide who to vote for. Therefore, you need to ensure that the information you include in your video is accurate. Beyond political reasons, you also have an ethical responsibility to share factual material. You also want to ensure that your video doesn’t include any embarrassing information that can hurt your campaign in the long run.

**Promote on Various Platforms**

Your target audience is on different platforms, and you need to take the video to them. The legal voting age is eighteen years. Therefore, you should bear this in mind when choosing the right platform to promote your video. Consider sites with politically-engaged voters and ensure you promote your video on such platforms.

**Final Thoughts**

Video content is essential for most modern campaigns; you can easily promote it on various social media platforms. For example, you can start with an introductory political video and then host a Q&A session down the line. Ensure you edit your video after filming to ensure it looks optimized and catchy for your audience. By implementing the practices shared in this article, your video should reach your target audience seamlessly.

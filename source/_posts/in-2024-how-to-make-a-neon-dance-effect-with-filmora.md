##### Step6 Create Multiple Outlines

It would help if you created multiple outlines to achieve the Neon Dance effect. These multiple outlines will be produced by exporting them multiple times with the color you want. Follow the below points to get it instantly!

* When you have selected the color for your outline, export the video by clicking on the **Export** icon in the top right corner.

![export the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-8.png)

* As we had selected the **Blue** color for reference, now choose another color you wish.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Export as many times as you want with the color of your choice. **E.g., 5 colors = 5 exports.**

##### Step7 Import the exported videos

**Note:** You don't want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.

* To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.

**Tip:** The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.

![offset the videos by a few seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-9.png)

* Click and **drag** the glow effect to each of the exported videos.

The **freeze-frame video editing** effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.

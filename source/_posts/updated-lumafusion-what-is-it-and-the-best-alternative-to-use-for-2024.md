### 04How long does it take to create a single recording slide show PowerPoint?

It takes a lot of time and effort to create a single recording slide show PowerPoint. This is because of the time it takes to go through all the slides and find the right images.

It is best if you start by finding out what you want to say with your presentation. Then, select images that support your message, and finally, create slides that tell your story.

This process will save a lot of time and effort when it comes to creating slide shows for presentations.

### 05How long can a recording slide show PowerPoint be recorded?

The length of a PowerPoint recording is determined by the length of the slide show. The default setting for the length of the slide show is 60 minutes, but it can be changed to any duration.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** Recorded slide show presentations are best to consider when one wishes to save the efforts of creating the same presentation again and again.

**●** Filmora is one of the best video editing tools available to users for doing the editing in the recorded slideshow presentation if needed.

**●** Recording a slideshow is relatively an easy task if one is aware of the right steps. But if there is a lack of knowledge, they will not be able to do it.

## Tutorial 2 on make color isolation using eyedropper tool

You might ask how do we use the eyedropper tool here. It can sample colors from anywhere in a video or an image and add them to your swatch panel. The steps to use the eyedropper tool to add a selective color to your video are below.

Step1 As same as the first one, launching Wondershare Filmora is the first priority. And drag your clip to the timeline.

![drag clip to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-10.jpg)

Step2 Go to effects at the top, and find Newblue effects, and click on the Newblue filters.

Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.

![clicking on the second color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-15.jpg)

![masking in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-masking.JPG)

## Overview of Masking in After Effects

Masking in After Effects hides or reveals certain layer parts, such as an image or video. This is achieved through masks, paths that determine the visibility of specific layer parts. Masks are an incredibly versatile tool in Adobe After Effects, allowing users to cut out and combine elements, create professional transitions, isolate objects in photos or videos, and build shapes, among other things.

Masks in After Effects are made up of two parts: the mask and the fill. The mask controls what is visible, while the fill determines the color or image used to fill the masked area.

By default, when a mask is created, it is set to "inverted," meaning the masked area is visible, and the rest is hidden. However, this can easily be changed by pressing "M" to access the mask settings in the timeline and selecting the invert checkmark. Alternatively, the mode can be changed to subtract.

Overall, masks are an essential tool in After Effects, and it's worth taking the time to learn as much as possible about them. The possibilities are endless, and mastering masks can greatly enhance your projects.

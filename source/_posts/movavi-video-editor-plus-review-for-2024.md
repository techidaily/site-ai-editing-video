Object Animation, Automatic Video Creation, and more built-in media are the highlights of Video Editor Plus 2022\. Let's see how they work together!

### **Interface**

The Movavi Video Editor Plus 2022 is one of Movavi's aesthetically pleasing apps. When selecting different tabs on the upper part of the interface, toolbars and tabs can be found at the top or on the left, and the tools will expand. Right on the right is a player that lets you preview samples of videos, transitions, titles, and so on. Even dozens of tracks can be added and edited at once to create your video, as you can add video, audio, and images to the timeline at the bottom.

### **Quick Video Creation**

This is one of the best features of this video editor. Adding a video, selecting a template, then adding loyalty-free audios will quickly create a video with the help of the video creation wizard.

### **Editing Tools**

You can edit your videos with all the editing tools necessary to make them more personal, such as Rotate, Crop, Trim, Split, Stabilize, Adjust colors, Combine, Stabilize, Pan and Zoom, Slow motion, Chroma key, Scene detection, Animate, Highlight & Concealed, Add logo, Overlay, etc. Applying an editing tool is as simple as selecting a video, choosing a tool, and configuring the settings.

In addition, it allows editing of video and audio properties, providing excellent detail treatment. A video can be sped up or lowered, normalized, changed opacity, reversed, faded in or out, and synchronized, equalized, noise removed, audio effects added, and the beat detected.

### **Creativity: Filters, Transitions, Titles and Stickers**

To make your video more personal, you will need to add filters, titles, transitions, and stickers. Movavi video editor offers free templates built-in and templates that can be purchased from its store. It has all the templates organized into themes, the design is very pleasing to the eye, and we are more likely to try these effects.

### **Sharing and output**

Unless you're actively streaming videos on video streaming platforms, this sharing feature may be helpful for you. Logging in allows you to upload videos directly to YouTube, YouTube Video, and Google Drive.

The export feature supports a wide range of video and audio formats that are highly frequently used. Leave them alone if you don't have a good reason to change the output settings. The program will display the current file size when you choose a different video quality, which is useful if you have limited storage space.

### **Tutorials**

It isn't easy to edit videos, unlike other tasks. An online video tutorial will be of great help if you wish to learn how to effectively use a video editor and perform specific video editing tasks.

Movi's instructions explain how to add files to the program and how to edit videos when you first run it. Additionally, it organizes all video tutorials in one place in the Notification panel for performing specific video editing tasks. You can play a tutorial by scrolling down. Every week, the tutorials are updated, greatly reducing the time it takes to get started with this tool and inspiring us to create amazing videos we would never have dreamed of.

## **Final Verdict**

There is no doubt that Movavi is a great video editor. It is often compared with the Movavi video suite, but they have their usage. It is feature-rich and comes with a variety of options. Overall, it is good, but if you are looking for something very professional and easy to use, it might not be the right option. Over the years, the Movavi downloads have increased rapidly, but if you want to create professional and eye-catching videos, then we recommend you to use the Filmora X video editor.

## 2 Solutions to Cut Video in VLC on Windows

Other than playing videos and music, VLC Media Player can also be used as a video editing tool. While advanced video editing requires unconventional and powerful video editing software, VLC offers a simpler and easy-to-learn process of cutting and/or trimming videos.

You can cut a section of your video and make shorter video clips. This means that you can now get rid of parts of a video that you do not need and preserve those that you like. VLC automatically saves the video clips made, so you do not have to save them again.

In this article, we are going to learn the simplest procedure on how to cut and/or trim videos using VLC Media Player. Each step is carefully explained, with screenshots attached.

## To Cut Video Using VLC Media Player

1. **Download VLC Media Player**

There are a variety of versions that is, 32-bit, 64-bit and Windows ARM. You may as well narrow down your search to the version of your gadget, be it Android, iOS, Linux or Windows.

The video will start playing.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-2.png)

1. **Click on Advanced Controls (View > Advanced Controls)**

Some videos will play automatically while others will wait for an action. In case your video plays automatically, it is advisable that you pause it.

On the menu is a tab labelled ‘View’. Choose the tab, click open it and on the drop-down menu, select ‘Advanced Options’.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-3.png)

Its purpose is to indicate the recording of the section of the video that you would like to cut.

1. **Click to Cut or Trim**

If you had paused your video, you can play it at this stage. If you do not want to cut/trim your video from the start, scroll to the point from which you would like to cut it. Click on the red button for the recording to start. If the video does not play automatically, click to play.

After the video has played till the point where you would like to end, click on the red button again to stop the recording. The cut section will be automatically saved on the videos’ folder on **C:\\Users\\Username\\Videos**.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-5.png)

1. **Trimming the video**

After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.

To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-6.png)

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-7.png)

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

1. **Cutting the video**

Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.

With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-8.png)

After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.

1. **Save and/or Import your video**

The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.

## What If Quicktime Player Speed up With No Sound?

No sound may be heard when the video is played back if it was encoded in a format that QuickTime cannot understand. Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.

### Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.

## How to Play Videos at 2X Speed with Sound in Quicktime?

Follow the below-mentioned steps to play video at 2x speed with sound in Quicktime:

* Launch QuickTime.
* Click on Edit, which is located on the toolbar on the top. A drop-down menu will appear.
* From the drop-down menu, click on QuickTime Preferences.
* Then select Audio from the dialogue box.
* Then moving forward, change the music synthesizer to Promethean Audio Device, Promethean USB Audio or USB Audio Device. These options might vary depending on the user's specific hardware.
* Click on Apply and then OK.

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.

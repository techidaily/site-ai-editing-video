## How to Zoom Picture in Picture [Easy Solution]

Zoom is one of the greatest options on the market for video conferencing. It doesn't matter whether you use it at home or in an office environment; it will quickly link the team members. One of the most popular video conferencing programs is Zoom. When in-person meetings aren't feasible, it enables you to communicate electronically with employees, and it's been a major popularity for social occasions as well. In case you're not acquainted, picture-in-picture mode enables you to watch videos from one app while using your PC normally. The movie will keep playing in a tiny thumbnail window so that two applications may work simultaneously on your smartphone.

You may create virtual audio and video conferences, webinars, live chats, screen sharing, and other collaboration tools with Zoom, a cloud-based video communications solution. Zoom's most recent iPhone apps let you dismiss a Zoom Meeting while keeping the Zoom video call open in a picture-in-picture mode. To join a Zoom conference, you don't need an account, and because the software works with Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android devices, nearly anybody can use it. Since using Zoom's picture-in-picture mode is the same as using it with other applications, you shouldn't have any trouble if you often use PiP mode. Here are the top 4 methods you can refer to picture in picture in Zoom.

## Method 1: Swap Shared Screen with Video

You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Before leaving the meeting if you're not giving a presentation or speaking, you should definitely mute Zoom on your iPhone to prevent noises from your typing or other activities from entering the conversation. Additionally, keep in mind to switch off the camera if you're engaged in something distracting, at least for the duration of your activity. To reopen the Zoom Meeting and go back to the Zoom app, touch the Picture-in-Picture mode pane. Here are some actions to keep in mind:

### Steps to Swap Shared Screen for Zoom Picture in Picture

Step1Launch or enter a Zoom meeting. Keep the video on your main screen at all times, closing the chat and participant list as necessary.

Step2Tap the Home button or swipe up from the bottom of the screen.

As a result, the ATEM Mini can automatically convert inputs that are 1080p, 1080i, or 720p to the switcher's video standard. You may make quick changes between inputs with no latency or disruption to your video output by using the ergonomic buttons.

Step3As a third option, Zoom offers ATEM Mini, which enables you to switch between several inputs, add custom visuals, and adjust audio levels all from a single interface. To improve the quality of your production, you may even use smooth transitions like wipes or fades. You can even test any input stream before making it live.

## Conclusion

When you are doing a Zoom Meeting and share your screen, only to discover that what the other attendees see is a split screen with your material and the other Attendee cams, it is highly annoying. You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Someone must be sharing information in the Zoom conference for the Picture in Picture, or "Split Screen" option, to be active. We've listed the top techniques for doing it effectively above. To do this work without difficulty, use them as your guide.

##### Step4Share Recordings

When you have everything ready, export your recording right away. After you're done with the editing part, you do have a lot of options to choose from when displaying your screen capture and webcam stories. To do so, click the Export button in the item user interface's top-right corner as shown below:

You may easily choose your preferred way to share from there if you choose to upload your work of zoom picture in picture recordings straight to the YouTube or other reputable websites right now. Simply refer to the Sharing plug-ins in the Export window to find out more.

## Method 4: Use Hardware Switcher ATEM Mini Pro

Particularly on Zoom, the ATEM Mini is excellent for video conferences. The Blackmagic ATEM Mini is a USB video interface and HDMI switcher. Four HDMI inputs, or four cameras that can produce an HDMI video stream, may be switched between live. This device integrates Zoom meetings fast and makes it incredibly simple to set up your audio, a sometimes-forgotten aspect of video broadcasting. This sophisticated video switcher promises to offer broadcast-quality multi-camera footage with ease and is targeted at gamers, streamers, and online reviewers. It connects to a computer via a USB-C to USB-A connection. The video feed may then be sent to distant colleagues via a number of well-liked videos streaming services, including Zoom.

Step1The ATEM Mini Pro is a basic control switcher with pro-broadcast performance. Your ATEM Mini Pro is really simple to set up. You can connect a full setup with several cameras and microphones in around 30 minutes.

![how to zoom picture in picture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hardware-switcher-atem-mini-pro.jpg)

Step2You may connect several camera sources to the inputs of the ATEM Mini Pro. The 4 HDMI inputs each have a separate standards converter built in. As a result, the ATEM Mini can automatically convert inputs that are 1080p, 1080i, or 720p to the switcher's video standard. You may make quick changes between inputs with no latency or disruption to your video output by using the ergonomic buttons.

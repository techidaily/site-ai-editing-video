#### ● Switch Between Six Workspace Layouts

Step 12

Increase the Line’s length to be almost as long as the screen. Then adjust its position until half of the Line is visible on the screen. Like this.

![edit shape in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-line.png)

Step 13

Copy this Default Title and paste it into Track 9\. Open its Advanced settings and change the Line color to something different than the previous one. Then, move it to the other side of the screen, slightly above the previous line. Click **OK.**

![add line shapes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lines.png)

Step 14

Now, select the Default Title on Track 9, double-click it, and go to the **Animation** tab. Move the Playhead at the starting point of the Timeline and add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead to the end of the clip. Drag the **X-axis** position to the right until the Line shape moves all the way to the right side of the screen.

Do the same for the Default Title on Track 8\. But this time, drag the **X-axis** position toward the other side. When you’re done, press **OK.**

![animate shapes filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line-move.png)

Step 15

Go to the **Effects** tab → drag the **Luma Sharp** effect to Track 10\. Click it and change its **Intensity** to **10.**

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Step 1

Download and Install the [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Then, click on **New Project** once the program starts.

Step 2

Go to **Titles** and drag the Default Title to the Timeline. Then, double-click on the Default Title clip to open its settings. Here, type in your text → change the text color to **Black** → click **OK** → take a snapshot.

![edit title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png)

Step 3

Double-click on the Default Title once more and simply change the text color to anything other than black this time. Then, click **OK** and take another snapshot. After this, delete the Default Title from the Timeline.

Step 4

Next, go to **Sample Color** and drag the White color to the Timeline. Increase the White Color clip’s duration to 10 seconds by dragging the tail of the clip to the right.

![sample color filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/white.png)

Step 5

For the next step, you need to download a simple [Vignette png image](https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/ihbooTJ%5Feffect-gfx-png-black-vignette-png-transparent-png/). Then, import the Vignette image into Filmora. Go to **My Media** and click on **Import Media.** Import it and drag the image to the Timeline. Then, move that clip to Track 3.

![vignette png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vignette.png)

Step 6

Drop the **Black** snapshot you took earlier to Track 2\. Double-click on it, go to **Animation**, and apply these settings. After this, move the Playhead to the end of the clip and change the **X-axis** value to “**\-800**”.

![snapshot settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black.png)

Step 7

Go to **Effects** and drag the **Square Blur** effect to Track 4 on the Timeline. Increase its duration to match the other clips. Then, click on the effect and change its **Size** bar value to 4\. Click **OK.**

![add effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/effect.png)

Step 8

Place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip. Go to **My Media** and drag the Black snapshot to Track 5\. Double-click on it → go to **Animation** and change the settings to look like this. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds. Here, change the **X-axis** to “**150”** and the **Scale** to **75%.**

![edit snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black-snapshot.png)

Step 9

Now, place the Playhead at the starting point and drag the colored snapshot in Track 6\. Double-click on it and change the **Scale** to **50%**. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds again and change the **Scale** to **75%.** Click **OK.**

Step 10

Go to **Sample Color** and drag “Gradient 4” to Track 7 on the Timeline. Double-click on it → go to the **Video** tab → change the Blending Mode to **Overlay** → decrease the Opacity to **25%.** Click **OK.**

![gradient sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/gradient.png)

Step 11

Drag a Default Title to Track 8 and double-click on it to open its Advanced settings. From here, delete the yellow text clip located under the video. Then, insert a Line shape.

![insert line shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line.png)

Step 12

Increase the Line’s length to be almost as long as the screen. Then adjust its position until half of the Line is visible on the screen. Like this.

![edit shape in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-line.png)

Step 13

![add line shapes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lines.png)

Step 14

Now, select the Default Title on Track 9, double-click it, and go to the **Animation** tab. Move the Playhead at the starting point of the Timeline and add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead to the end of the clip. Drag the **X-axis** position to the right until the Line shape moves all the way to the right side of the screen.

Do the same for the Default Title on Track 8\. But this time, drag the **X-axis** position toward the other side. When you’re done, press **OK.**

![animate shapes filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line-move.png)

Step 15

Go to the **Effects** tab → drag the **Luma Sharp** effect to Track 10\. Click it and change its **Intensity** to **10.**

![add luma sharp effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/luma-sharp.png)

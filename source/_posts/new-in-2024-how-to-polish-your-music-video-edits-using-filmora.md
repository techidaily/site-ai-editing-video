### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

### 7\. A Family Wearing Handmade Halloween Mask At Home

Another not-so-fancy, subtle, and understated appeal for the Halloween vacation countdown clock video is a family together with Halloween masks.

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video.

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video? There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.

![mummy costume filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-14.jpg)

Hosting a Halloween party for kids and in search of the perfect vertical footage for a Halloween vacation countdown clock video?

### 1\. Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

##### Step2Add Color Templates

After installing, wait until the installation is finished. Launch Wondershare Filmora and go to MEDIA tab at the top left of the interface and select the best suitable background color for your intro video from the dropdown menu in the MEDIA tab. Drag your cursor over the tile of the color you wish to use as a background and click to add the icon that appears in the center to add it to the timeline.

![media for use 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/media-for-use-01.png)

Additionally, if you don’t prefer the preset backgrounds and colors, Filmora lets you use your own background image or video clip. For this, select PROJECT MEDIA > click anywhere inside the media window > import media file of your choice. After importing the file, click on the imported file to add it to the timeline.

##### Step3Select and add audio effect to your Intro Video

Your video automatically grasps a lot of viewers’ attention with a spice of some music/audio in the background. To adorn your intro video further, you can add audio/music effect to your intro video using the inbuilt music and sound effects from the library. If you want to listen to a track from the inbuilt library collection of audio and music, double click on the thumbnail.

![types of audio win1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/types-of-audio-win-1.png)

Click the AUDIO tab. Choose from Recommended audio files or import your own audio. Once, you find your desired audio/music file, drag and drop it to the audio track below the video.

##### Step4Add Text/Logo to your Intro Video

Click the ‘TITLE’ tab. To customize, choose title options from Recommended or add your own custom design. To change, format, and animate the text as needed, click on your desired preset or custom title and double click or drag it to the bottom area of the main library to insert a title.

![add titles win](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-2.png)

Also, you need to adjust the position and duration of the title to get a better view. In the intro video, it is recommended to add your logo or slogan as well. To add your logo, drag and drop it to the track above the video, and adjust its position and size.

##### Step5Add Effects to your Intro Video

Go to ‘EFFECTS’ tab, choose a category from the top-left pane, and click and drag your preferred effect from the Effects library to the timeline. Adjust the playback duration by dragging the right handle of the track in the timeline as explained above. Optionally, double-click the Effects track to customize the appearance as needed.

##### Step6Export the Intro and Add to Shared Media

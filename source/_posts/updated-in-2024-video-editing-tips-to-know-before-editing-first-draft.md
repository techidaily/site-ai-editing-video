## Part 3: FAQs About Video Loop

**1\. Can you loop animation in Canva?**

Yes, we can make loop animation in Canva. Looping animation in Canva software is not difficult, but it does require a little bit of practice. To loop animation in Canva, follow these steps:

* Go to the Animation tab on the left side of the screen.
* Click on the New Animation button in the top right corner of your screen.
* Select the type of animation you want to create from the drop-down menu next to "Create New Animation From." This will open up a window that allows you to select between several different options for how your animation will appear, choose one that appeals most to you!

**2\. How do I loop an mp4 video?**

Looping the mp4 video is a fairly simple process. First, you need to import the video into your computer. The easiest way to do this is using the .mp4 files that come with your camera or phone. You can also use any other audio file or a preview of the video as an indicator of where you want to start and end your looping.

Once you have imported your video, you can begin looping it. To do this, click on the “play” button and wait until all the videos have been played. Then, click on one of the two buttons below. The bottom button will play one frame forward in time while the top button will play one frame backward in time.

**3\. How do I make Canva videos longer?**

We've got a special function in Canva that lets you crop your video while making it longer. Here's how:

* Go to the video editor by clicking the cog icon on the top right of your screen.
* Select "Crop Video" from the menu.
* Choose how much footage you want to cut out and press "OK."

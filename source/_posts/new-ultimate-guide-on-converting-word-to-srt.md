## Part 1: What is SRT?

An SRT is one of the most common formats used in subtitling or captioning files. 'SRT' refers to a 'SubRip Subtitle' file, which originated from the DVD-ripping software by the same name. [SubRip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) would extract or rip subtitles and timings from live video, recorded video, and DVDs.

SRT has four major components:

1. A numeric counter indicates the number or position of the subtitle.
2. A Start and end time of the subtitle which is separated by the characters.
3. A Subtitle in one or more lines.
4. A blank line indicates the ending of the subtitle.

Now that you know about SRT let's understand why you should convert your Word file to SRT.

## Part 2: Why Should You Convert Word to SRT?

Most subtitles on the Internet are distributed in SRT format. Moreover, media players, lecture capture software, and video recording software are compatible with the SRT format.

Also, user frequently asks from forum like:

“I received a docx. file with subtitles already translated and the corresponding YouTube video URL. I was asked to proofread and then embed the subtitles into the video.”

To solve this, you can not only save it as a TXT document and change the file extension to .SRT, but also, a much easier way, convert subtitles from Microsoft Word files to SRT format through a easy-to-use SRT converter.

## Part 3: How to Convert a Word file to an SRT file without the software?

**Before we dive into the concrete steps guide, here are things we need to be considered:**

### Timestamp issue

Timestamps identify the exact point in an audio or video where the given text was spoken.

Now we know what a timestamp is and why it's important. Let's find out how to add timestamps in the SRT file.

**How to add timestamps**:

There are two ways to add timestamps in the file.

1. **Either add timestamps manually in the word document.**

To write timecodes, the format used is Hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds and milliseconds being rounded to 3 decimal places. Separate each timestamp with a two-hash arrow (written as - ->) and a blank line indicates the next caption sequence. After saving, these files are named with .srt extension.

1. **Or edit the SRT file after creating it using a video editor which has the ability to edit SRT.**

You can also edit the SRT file after creating it by using video editing software such as [Happy Scribe’s](https://www.happyscribe.com/). It has audio-to-text/video-to-text feature that includes multiple timestamps options.

### Language Conversion Feature of SRT file

You can use this to convert each line of your subtitles from one language to another. It also supports language conversion between English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, etc. It's an easy process.

In any of the two cases mantioned above, you need to convert Word document in to SRT. Let’s find out how can you do that without using any software.

Follow the below steps to convert a word file to SRT without any software.

##### Step1 Open your Docx file

For this, open the word document you want to convert.

##### Step2 Change it to a .TXT document

Then from the left corner, Click on File>save as> and select the “Text” to convert it.

If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,

1. Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer
2. Go to view
3. Click on the check box for “File name extensions”

## Turn Your Text Into a Podcast Made Possible (+ EASY Editing Tips)

Being a content creator, either writing or generating videos, requires podcast text-to-speech knowledge. The impact of content depends on how many people see it. It means finding new ways to get it into real and virtual places where customers and users might be.

Depending on the context, podcasting can be a perfect alternative for sharing content.

This article will address your questions about the easiest way to turn a blog into a podcast. Let's begin with the reasons why you should do a podcast.

## Part 1\. Why You Should Podcast

Podcasts are one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways. It helps to advertise yourself and your products to a highly targeted audience. Podcasts are also excellent for engaging with potential clients interested in your content. In your field, you can achieve fame and expertise.

![effective podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/turn-your-text-into-a-podcast-made-possible-1.jpg)

### Repurposing of Content

Podcasters can maximize their potential for successful episodes and repurposing their podcast into multiple content pieces.

This podcasting strategy can help you reach more people by putting your podcasts on more channels and engaging more people who might be interested.

### More Fulfilling than Articles

Unlike music, news, TV, and social media, podcast listeners don't have to watch the screen like they do with YouTube videos or TV shows. This means they can listen while walking or driving home from work.

Podcasts are the best way to get people to pay attention and make fundamental societal changes. They can keep people interested for a long time, so you can go into detail and get personal without turning off your audience.

### Minimal Start-Up Costs

To start a podcast, you can spend a little money. Even some of the most famous podcasts use a microphone, a computer, and software for recording. But it's common to spend more money on advertising and better hosting.

Starting a podcast doesn't cost much, as you can get everything you need for about $145.

### Expansion of Search Potential

In the past few years, many big brands and small to medium-sized businesses have started using podcasts as a marketing strategy. This is because podcasts are becoming more and more popular and can help raise your company's profile.

Podcasting is another way to disseminate your study to a broader audience, whether that audience consists of policymakers or interested citizens.

### Potential to Monetize

Using an affiliate program podcast, you can earn money. Businesses can increase their income by offering paid advertising sponsorships to monetize podcasts. Suppose you accept an affiliate offer to sell ads. In that case, you become the company's voice and put recorded ads in your podcast episodes.

The most common way to make money from a podcast is through sponsorship. It's also the easiest way to make money because you don't have to make or sell anything. You just have to make a deal with a sponsor.

## Part 2\. Why Are Writers Hesitant to Start a Podcast?

Even after knowing all these benefits, writers are still hesitant to start a podcast. One of the main reasons a writer may be reluctant to launch a podcast is the cost of the necessary equipment. You will need at least $80 to $500 for this unpromissing business.

However, let me tell you a secret that many podcastors didn't buy any audio equipment for the launch of their podcast channel on Spotify.

Moreover, many writers don't want to show their voice through recordings. This is because they couldn't just make a recording and hand it off to a sound specialist. Besides, finding their voice through the stories they write is the routine.

But we all need to get the truth that many podcastors don't record a single word of the podcast with their own voice. Due to a solution: text-to-speech, technology like this has been around for a while and continues to improve.

The two important issues have been solved, so what are you waiting for? Platform building has always relied heavily on content marketing. With blog posts and social media, additional support was provided, and now podcasts are becoming more commonplace.

## Part 3\. How to Turn a Text Into a Podcast?

### Text To Speech

To turn your text into audible content, Text-to-speech (TTS) is an assistive technology. With a single click, TTS reads your written text aloud. Many people also use it for writing and editing to maintain audience concentration.

Text-to-speech technology is compatible with all digital devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. Increasing numbers of websites and products now have developed this function. For example, you can find it within the trusted video editing software like Filmora. With [Filmora's Text to Speech (TTS) feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you may add extra aspects to your video by turning your text files into voiceovers.

**Why we regard text to speech as a good**

For writers, imagination is the only tool to construct their stories. To bring our stories to life, all we need is a laptop. The same holds for text-to-speech technologies, which can significantly assist writing and editing by allowing the author to hear their words without using their voice.

* Text-to-speech applications can assist you in repurposing your material.

Your written work can be converted into spoken language or a podcast. A podcast can be converted into a YouTube video with a few alterations. All of these factors can help you reach new audiences.

Repurposing material permits your audience to consume it in a variety of ways. The audience can read, listen to, or view your content.

* Text-to-speech systems enable authors to create information that is accessible.

As per World Health Organization, there are almost 285 million visually impaired persons and 39 million blind people. We writers can create a more inclusive world by constantly keeping accessibility in mind.

**The limitations of text to speech**

Text-to-speech software is becoming increasingly lifelike thanks to technological advancements. However, it cannot still express genuine human emotions. However, this should allow you to utilize these tools. The positives significantly exceed the disadvantages, and technology is continually improving.

## 5 Ways to Denoise a Video

In today’s world, the quality of digital product such as photos and videos increase day by day, prompting us to create our content crystal clear and keep it that way. Of course, different kinds of effects and filters are great, and something called “noise” is one of them, but sometimes it is actually unwanted and makes our footage less likable. What is noise, or denoising, anyway? Well, instead of clear video, it’s something quite different – the footage looks grainy, sometimes excessively, and makes our eyes hurt, or simply, more difficult to see what’s going on on the screen. And if you didn’t decide to use a noise effect, then from where does it appear?..

Noise means a mix of different variations of brightness or color information in the shot. It is likely to show up when there is a low light, and/or when the video is taken with small sensors such as smartphones and action cameras. It works as follows: if someone tries to compensate for low-light settings with gain and ISO, more noise is produced.

But, as our readers already know, almost nothing is ever impossible to solve. There is a way to get rid of this annoying grain, and it is called, as pretty obvious, denoising. Hence, denoising in image and video production is used as a technique to take footage from grainy to crystal-clear. And, as you may already agree, it improves a viewer’s quality of experience. And how does this happen? - There are varied techniques, and each of them uses different mathematical and statistical models.

What is considered a good noise reduction? The technique is successful when it suppresses noise effectively in uniform regions; preserves edges and other characteristics, such as fine details and textures; and provides a visually natural experience.

and here you will learn 5 ways, as in 5 software to denoise a video. We’ll touch upon the following ones: Final Cut Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve and Movavi Video Editor. But, we are not limited to these ones, so maybe there is one more you could use? You’ll find out in the article!

* **Final Cut Pro**

Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is not eligible for PC, this editor is only available for Mac (but Windows users, tune in for the editors functioning on PC’s!)

So, you have your grained footage, which you already chose to denoise, and for which you will need a video reduction effect.

First, you will need to open Final Cut Pro and import abovementioned video. Select this clip in the timeline,

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-1.jpg)

and position the play head in a way that the clip appears in the viewer, that is, on the big screen - for you to see well.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-2.jpg)

Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline, or, to use the shortcut, press Command & 5.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-3.jpg)

In the Effects browser, select the Basics category in the list of Video effects on the left, then select the Noise Reduction effect. For 360° clips, select the 360° category, then select the 360° Noise Reduction effect.

And you will need to do one of the following:

Drag the effect to the timeline clip you want to apply it to, or double-click the effect thumbnail to apply the effect to the selected clip.

When the effect is applied, Final Cut Pro analyzes the clip for noise, so you might need to wait for a little while the process is complete and only then see the result.

Interesting tip you can remember is that if you are using several effects to your video clip, then adding Noise Reduction as the first effect would guarantee the best results for you. So, Mac users, you can start denoising your videos in Final Cut Pro now!

* **Adobe After Effects**

Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application… Pretty intense, right? This very software has endless powers, and one of them is, you guessed correctly – denoising the video! So, how are we going to do that in this monster of the industry?

Sometimes what’s annoying about this kind of programs is that you need plugins, so let’s try to find a way to achieve our desired result without using anything external.

So, first of all (as in all cases!) import your video into After Effects. Then, you will need to find Effect in the menu, and find: Noise and Grain. There, you will choose Remove Grain and click on it.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-4.jpg)

On the left side of the program layout, the Effects Control will be opened. Now, you see viewing mode, where you need to change Preview to Final Output.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-5.jpg)

So, this will be the video with Preview checked:

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-6.jpg)

Which will look like this when Final Output is checked:

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-7.jpg)

Somewhat different and looking better, right?..

By the way, you can watch the whole process video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8pqSysA90)!

* **Adobe Premiere Pro**

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most and sophisticated video editor. So, of course, there is a way to reduce noise in this software as well, and this can be reached using effect called Median.

First of all, you add your footage to the Timeline in Premiere Pro and then go find the Effects Panel, where Median can be found. You need to drag and drop the Median effect to your video clip.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-8.jpg)

The next step is to make sure that adding the effect to the grainiest parts of the clip, which can be done using masks. So, in the Effects Control panel, you’ll need to select the mask shape for your clip – you can either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With the latter you can move the Mask around the screen and resize it to cover the area.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-9.jpg)

And if you Change the Feather setting to 100, the effect will not have a very visible edge and some smoothness will cover for it.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-10.jpg)

You will need to repeat the process with more than one mask, if you would like to have covered all of the grainy area of your shot.

Lastly, you’ll need to adjust the effect settings to reduce the noise.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-11.jpg)

The Median effect doesn’t actually take away the graininess, it just blurs it. You’ll need to experiment with the Radius settings until you are happy with the result.

* **DaVinci Resolve**

When it comes to DaVinci Resolve, the process is somewhat different in the free version of it. So, first of all, off course, you add your footage into the timeline. Then,you are going to find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-12.jpg)

You will see MediaIn1 and MediaOut1, you click on MediaIn1, which will ensure the scene appears in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, now you stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find the option which says: Remove Noise (RN) and then click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner you will find Inspector, and if you click on it, you will see all the properties you can modify.

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar we can find channel icons. We open it and click on red, which makes the footage black and white for a while. Then, we go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-13.jpg)

This removes much grain from the red channel. Then we repeat the same for green, as well as for blue channel. Once you finish, you go to the same channel button in the bar and change it to “back to color”. So, the footage will have its colors back and you will see that it has become clearer, compared to the first viewer.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-14.jpg)

You can play around with the Chroma and Luma channels in the Inspector, if that is something you have ever had experience with!

* **Movavi Video Editor**

In Movavi Video Editor, it is pretty straightforward – unlike DaVinci Resolve, of course! So, getting to the point: the first thing you need to do is Entering the Edit Mode. In order to achieve it, you’ll need to click the Edit button next to the file you want to adjust or select Adjustments in the Tools tab.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-15.jpg)

After this, you will be able to select the Noise removal option, and then, move the Noise level slider to reflect the amount of noise you can see in the preview. The more noise you need to remove, the higher the Noise level, and vice versa.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-16.jpg)

When you're finished removing the noise, click Apply, but in case you need to remove noise from several files, select Apply to all files, which ensures the same noise level will be applied on all your files there.

Lastly, of course, Wondershare Filmora X offers the same option as well. The steps are ase follows: You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. Then, right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-17.jpg)

This will make sure you go inside the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-18.jpg)

You should reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. Then, you can use the box next to Smart Denoise in order to see the scene before and after noise and grain removal.

So, that’s it! – We learned how to remove/reduce noise and grain from the videos, using several video editors. So you might as well start making your video clips look better right away!

Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it.

First of all, you add your footage to the Timeline in Premiere Pro and then go find the Effects Panel, where Median can be found. You need to drag and drop the Median effect to your video clip.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-8.jpg)

The next step is to make sure that adding the effect to the grainiest parts of the clip, which can be done using masks. So, in the Effects Control panel, you’ll need to select the mask shape for your clip – you can either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With the latter you can move the Mask around the screen and resize it to cover the area.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-9.jpg)

And if you Change the Feather setting to 100, the effect will not have a very visible edge and some smoothness will cover for it.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-10.jpg)

You will need to repeat the process with more than one mask, if you would like to have covered all of the grainy area of your shot.

Lastly, you’ll need to adjust the effect settings to reduce the noise.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-11.jpg)

The Median effect doesn’t actually take away the graininess, it just blurs it. You’ll need to experiment with the Radius settings until you are happy with the result.

* **DaVinci Resolve**

When it comes to DaVinci Resolve, the process is somewhat different in the free version of it. So, first of all, off course, you add your footage into the timeline. Then,you are going to find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-12.jpg)

You will see MediaIn1 and MediaOut1, you click on MediaIn1, which will ensure the scene appears in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, now you stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find the option which says: Remove Noise (RN) and then click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner you will find Inspector, and if you click on it, you will see all the properties you can modify.

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar we can find channel icons. We open it and click on red, which makes the footage black and white for a while. Then, we go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-13.jpg)

This removes much grain from the red channel. Then we repeat the same for green, as well as for blue channel. Once you finish, you go to the same channel button in the bar and change it to “back to color”. So, the footage will have its colors back and you will see that it has become clearer, compared to the first viewer.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-14.jpg)

You can play around with the Chroma and Luma channels in the Inspector, if that is something you have ever had experience with!

* **Movavi Video Editor**

In Movavi Video Editor, it is pretty straightforward – unlike DaVinci Resolve, of course! So, getting to the point: the first thing you need to do is Entering the Edit Mode. In order to achieve it, you’ll need to click the Edit button next to the file you want to adjust or select Adjustments in the Tools tab.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-15.jpg)

After this, you will be able to select the Noise removal option, and then, move the Noise level slider to reflect the amount of noise you can see in the preview. The more noise you need to remove, the higher the Noise level, and vice versa.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-16.jpg)

When you're finished removing the noise, click Apply, but in case you need to remove noise from several files, select Apply to all files, which ensures the same noise level will be applied on all your files there.

Lastly, of course, Wondershare Filmora X offers the same option as well. The steps are ase follows: You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. Then, right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-17.jpg)

This will make sure you go inside the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-18.jpg)

You should reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. Then, you can use the box next to Smart Denoise in order to see the scene before and after noise and grain removal.

So, that’s it! – We learned how to remove/reduce noise and grain from the videos, using several video editors. So you might as well start making your video clips look better right away!

Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is not eligible for PC, this editor is only available for Mac (but Windows users, tune in for the editors functioning on PC’s!)

So, you have your grained footage, which you already chose to denoise, and for which you will need a video reduction effect.

First, you will need to open Final Cut Pro and import abovementioned video. Select this clip in the timeline,

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-1.jpg)

and position the play head in a way that the clip appears in the viewer, that is, on the big screen - for you to see well.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-2.jpg)

Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline, or, to use the shortcut, press Command & 5.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-3.jpg)

In the Effects browser, select the Basics category in the list of Video effects on the left, then select the Noise Reduction effect. For 360° clips, select the 360° category, then select the 360° Noise Reduction effect.

And you will need to do one of the following:

Drag the effect to the timeline clip you want to apply it to, or double-click the effect thumbnail to apply the effect to the selected clip.

When the effect is applied, Final Cut Pro analyzes the clip for noise, so you might need to wait for a little while the process is complete and only then see the result.

Interesting tip you can remember is that if you are using several effects to your video clip, then adding Noise Reduction as the first effect would guarantee the best results for you. So, Mac users, you can start denoising your videos in Final Cut Pro now!

* **Adobe After Effects**

Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application… Pretty intense, right? This very software has endless powers, and one of them is, you guessed correctly – denoising the video! So, how are we going to do that in this monster of the industry?

Sometimes what’s annoying about this kind of programs is that you need plugins, so let’s try to find a way to achieve our desired result without using anything external.

So, first of all (as in all cases!) import your video into After Effects. Then, you will need to find Effect in the menu, and find: Noise and Grain. There, you will choose Remove Grain and click on it.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-4.jpg)

On the left side of the program layout, the Effects Control will be opened. Now, you see viewing mode, where you need to change Preview to Final Output.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-5.jpg)

So, this will be the video with Preview checked:

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-6.jpg)

Which will look like this when Final Output is checked:

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-7.jpg)

Somewhat different and looking better, right?..

## How To Add Fade In Windows Video Editor

A recent development in the media business is the fading into and out of videos, which significantly improves and cools down a scene. It causes the movie to twist and gives it a photorealistic appearance, giving the sense of depth. Too much or too little fading might ruin the whole impact of the video that has been generated, which is why we're providing instructions on how to apply fade in Windows video editors.

People often search for How to Add Fade in after effects but in such tools, backgrounds are used to achieve fading, so what should you do if you want your movie on your Windows 10 desktop to fade to black, white, or another color? We suggest the solution in this article that would be of assistance. It is suggested that you apply the video fades using a backdrop clip which is either black or white. Video fades come in two varieties: fade in and fade out. A video or picture may gradually appear from a black, white, or colored backdrop using a technique called a "fade-in." On the other hand, a video or picture may gradually blend into a white, black, or multicolored backdrop using the fade-out technique.

## Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor

To begin with, you'll need top-notch editing software for your movies. We advise you to try Windows Video Editor if you use Windows. It is slick, simple, and enjoyable to use. The Microsoft Store's most downloaded video editing app is also this one. To test how it works, you may install it for free. The Windows video editor is a strong tool that makes it simple for users to utilize the fundamentals of video editing. It has the ability to move, concatenate, cut, and add the Fading effects to videos. However, it lacks the transitions needed to insert them into videos or in between them.

**Steps to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor**

Step1Open Windows Video Editor and choose the video clip you wish to apply a fade to.

![choose video windows video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-video-windows-video-editor.jpg)

Step2To display further effects, click the down arrow in the corner of the effects tray after selecting the Visual Effects tab. The effects are divided into a group named Motions and Fades. To get an explanation and a sample of what the effects do, hover your mouse cursor over the thumbnails of the effects.

![click video tools windows editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-video-tools-windows-editor.jpg)

The available effects include pixelate, ripple, and a simple fade in or fade out to black or white. Apply No Effect, the first thumbnail in the list of visual effects, after choosing the clip and the visual effect you wish to remove.

Step3Select the desired video portion, then click the Edit tab under Video Tools to fade the video sound. The ribbon's initial part is devoted to audio controls. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.

## Part 3: FAQs Regarding Video Fade

### 1\. What is the fade panel in Windows video editor?

In the windows video editor, there is a panel for basic video editing tools. But for fading in/out of a video or text, there is no option available. The built-in windows tool does not have any option of 'transition'. It straight forwardly moves from one video clip to the other without any sort of transition because Microsoft believe these transitions to be lame and unnecessary. Hence, they are not available. In case of Filmora, and other such tools, there is a straight up option for transitions where you can fade in and out with a lot of other cool stuff. For fading you can follow the method mentioned above in the article.

### 2\. How do I fade text in Windows video editor?

As stated earlier, there is no option for fading in windows video editor, hence, even the text cannot be faded in or out. There is a panel for basic video editing tools in the Windows video editor. However, there is no ability for a video or text to fade in and out. There is no "transition" option in the built-in Windows programme. Microsoft considers these transitions to be unnecessary, so it simply switches from one video clip to the next without making any other effects.

### 3\. How do I fade out music in Windows video editor?

There is no direct command for making the music or sound fade out but you can do it manually, that is, in the video where ever you want the music or sound to fade out is that you can trim that clip out and then divide into two more clips. You can take the first of the two clips and lower its sound and in the next clip, you can mute the clip, note: the clips must be kept small, otherwise it will sound quite weird. If the respective lengths of the clips are kept quite small, only then will the fade feel natural. Due to unavailability of a direct command, fading the music out can be a very taxing job.

### The Bottom Line

The built-in video editor for Windows does not have a direct option, therefore fading procedures cannot be utilized without downloading and installing other software, such as Filmora, which may assist with such problems. Filmora comes with built-in tools for text, video, and audio fading. In Filmora, there are at least four different ways to fade media.

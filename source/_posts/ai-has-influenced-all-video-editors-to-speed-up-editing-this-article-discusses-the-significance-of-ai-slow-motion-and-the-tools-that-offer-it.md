## How to Create Vintage Film Effect 1990S

In the 90s, movie production technology improved a lot. This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological. In fact, we can say that the horror movies of the 90s laid the foundation for current horror movies. So, without wasting time, let's create a 1990s horror movie similar to The Blair Witch Project.

## Preparation

![1990s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1990s-vintage-scene.gif)

The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you've watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It's even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.

##### Step1 Add the horror video to the timeline

![add the horror video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-1.jpg)

Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.

##### Step2 Apply color grading

![apply color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-2.jpg)

Next, double-click the horror clip and go to the **Color** menu. Then, click the **Tone** arrow before lowering the **Saturation** to -50%. This will give us a less saturated look popularly used in horror films.

![double-click the horror clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-3.jpg)

Now click the **3D LUT** option and choose a LUT that works for your film. For this horror film project, we'll select the **Dark Film** option.

##### Step3 Add creepiness to the video

![add creepiness to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-4.jpg)

Obviously, you'll want your horror film to look as creepy as possible. To achieve that, click the **Elements** tab, then search for the **Smokescreen 1** effect. Move the effect to the timeline above the video track before trimming the effect clip to fit with the original horror video.

![click the elements tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-5.jpg)

We'll now change the size and positioning of the smokescreen effect to match the feature video. To do that, double-click the effect track. You can also reduce the opacity to around 30% to make the smoke more visible.

##### Step4 Add a retro filming effect

![add a retro filming effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-6.jpg)

Now we'll make the film more believable by adding a retro overlay. Click the **Effects** tab, then search for **Retro Film Overlay 15** before dragging and dropping the effect above all the tracks in the editing timeline.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-1.jpg)

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-2.jpg)

1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\. Otherwise, you can do various editings on the video like cropping, muting, trimming, animating, etc. before resizing the video. Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

1. **Adjust the file size of the video through export settings**

After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the **_Export_** button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

## **2 Ways to Resize FLV Videos on Android**

Wouldn’t it be great if you could resize FLV videos on your android device rather than having to open your computer for every small task? Previously, this was a major issue due to a lack of good video editors for android with flv support but that’s no longer the case. Below are two ways to resize FLV videos on android:

1. **AndroVid – Video Editor, Video Maker**

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-37.jpg)

AndroVid is an easy-to-use, full-featured video editor especially developed to edit videos for social media like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, etc. It is not a very popular application with just over 300k+ downloads in Google Play Store, but after testing it out, we thought it deserves to be in this article. It is available for free to download from Google Play Store.

**Steps to resize FLV videos on Android with AndroVid Video Editor:**

* Open AndroVid Video Editor on an android phone and go inside the **Videos**

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-38.jpg)

* Now select the FLV video file that you want to resize.

* Inside editor, tap on the **Crop** tool in the toolbar at the top.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-40.jpg)

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-41.jpg)

* If you need to change the resolution too, click on the three dots at the top right after the video is saved successfully. Then choose the preferred resolution, quality, and format and click on the tick icon to export.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

###

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

![select 3d lut in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/select-3d-lut.png)

Since you're creating your own LUT instead of using the pre-built LUTs, scroll down to adjust various things, such as the White Balance, Color, Light, HSL, and Vignette.

![adjust setting to create lut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-your-own-lut.png)

Tweak these settings until you’re satisfied with the results. To help you make the adjustments and balance the intensity of the colors in your footage, check the color histogram located at the top right corner of the window.

###

### Step 5\. Save Your LUT

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

## Part 2: Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?

There is a great misconception about HandBrake among the newbies that HandBrake is primarily a video merger software. But, in reality, that is not true at all. Or, at least, the latest HandBrake version 1.5.1 lacks such features.

Even the official website states that [HandBrake cannot combine](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/introduction/about.html#:~:text=does%20not%20do-,HandBrake%20does%20not%3A,video%20clips%20into%20one,-Pass-through%20video) two or more clips to make them whole.

So feel yourself lucky to read this article if you haven’t downloaded HandBrake yet. Congratulations! You are saved from another heartbreak.

But wait! If the software is not meant to merge clips, it doesn’t mean that you can’t use it to prepare your videos for the real deal. HandBrake can still be a helpful tool, permitting you to convert videos in a similar format before you start merging them on any other video editor.

For example, suppose you have two video clips in different formats. In that case, you can use HandBrake to convert all of them in a similar format so that they can be easily be merged when imported on any video merger tool.

But, again, the question is, if not HandBrake, then what?

Frankly, you will find hundreds of video editing tools with a combining clips feature, but not all of them deserve your attention and time. While software like DaVinci Resolve includes characteristics to merge two or more clips in a single shot, beginners and mid-level users may still find them a bit difficult at the start.

That is why professionals and experts prefer Filmora by Wondershare to merge videos without banging their heads on the screen.

So, how to merge videos in Filmora with simple clicks? Focus on the next part of the article to learn the step-by-step method within a few minutes.

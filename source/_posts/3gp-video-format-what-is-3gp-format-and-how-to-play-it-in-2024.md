Double-click on the title on the timeline, which will open the text editing window. Under the Text's Preset tab, you will find the parameters for changing the main fault. Adjust the font style to the Impact style (or any bold title style you prefer), and click on the text field to add your custom title.

![change the value here to 20](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-2.jpg)

## 3\. Split the title

On the editing timeline, tap on the Track 1 clip and click on the Snapshot icon at the far right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will automatically save in the media library section.

![tap on the text field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-6.jpg)

Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.

## Part 1 What Is a GIF and When to Use a GIF?

It is essential that we discuss what a GIF is? Firstly, GIF is the abbreviation for Graphics Interchange Format. Steve Wilhite, an American computer scantiest, was responsible for developing this bitmap image format with the team at the online services provider CompuServe.

The GIFs are images and animations whose sizes are reduced. The animations are much shorter in duration than the regular animation videos. It makes the animations look more expressive. The message, information, or expression to be portrayed through the animation gets better expressed due to its speed.

Therefore, the GIFs’ animations are much more exciting and engaging. A question might arise t you: Why should you use GIFs in slideshows, or how can they be beneficial.

Additionally, each GIF has its characteristic features different from the others. Each of them is interesting and engaging in their way.

**●** Use them in the first slide as a title slide. Whenever you use a GIF in the first or the introductory slide, you automatically initiate your presentation with something unique. And as a result, you successfully grab the audience’ leave a good impression. Additionally, from the first slide itself, you tend to have a comfortable and positive environment to continue your presentation more impeccably.

Ensure not to use URL GIFs that can face you with copyright issues.

**●** You can also use the screengrabs; you can easily pull the attention of your audience to different parts of your content, one after the another, most systematically and effectively. As a result, you can explain and express your content in the most detailed way possible.

**●** Either type of GIF that you can use are charts and graphs. In the first place, putting graphs and charts tend to make your presentation more organised, factual and professional. So, when you include GIFs of charts and graphs, you take the beneficial qualities of your display a notch higher.

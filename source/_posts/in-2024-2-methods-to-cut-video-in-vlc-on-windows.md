## 2 Methods to Cut Video in VLC on Windows

Other than playing videos and music, VLC Media Player can also be used as a video editing tool. While advanced video editing requires unconventional and powerful video editing software, VLC offers a simpler and easy-to-learn process of cutting and/or trimming videos.

You can cut a section of your video and make shorter video clips. This means that you can now get rid of parts of a video that you do not need and preserve those that you like. VLC automatically saves the video clips made, so you do not have to save them again.

In this article, we are going to learn the simplest procedure on how to cut and/or trim videos using VLC Media Player. Each step is carefully explained, with screenshots attached.

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

1. **Cutting the video**

Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.

With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.

After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.

1. **Save and/or Import your video**

The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.

1. **Trimming the video**

After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.

To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-7.png)

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

1. **Cutting the video**

Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.

With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-8.png)

After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.

1. **Save and/or Import your video**

The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-9.png)

Cutting on action is a technique the editors use to cut in the middle of an action to another shot that matches the first shot's action.

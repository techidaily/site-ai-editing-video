One of the most fundamental video editing skills you'll need to master is how to split clips in Final Cut Pro. After being divided in two, you can modify or reorganize one half of your clip without affecting the other.

### Way 1: Split a Clip in the Timeline (shortcut: Command+B)

**You can follow these steps to split a clip in the timeline:**

Step1The blade can be selected in Final Cut Pro by clicking the Tools pop-up menu in the timeline's upper left corner (or press B).

![clicking the tools pop up menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-1.jpg)

![click and move the skimmer to the frame in the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-2.jpg)

Step3You can split the video by following these two methods:

* Choose Trim > Join Clips after selecting one or both sides of the edit point (or press Delete).
* Choose Trim > Join Clips after selecting the clips on either side of the edit.

![selecting the clips on either side of the edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-3.jpg)

### Way 2\. Split several clips at the same time

**You can follow these steps to split several clips at the same time:**

Step1Move the skimmer to the desired cutting frame in the Final Cut Pro timeline.

![final cut pro timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-4.jpg)

Step2Deciding on Trim > Blade All (or press **Shift+Command+B**). At the skimmer position, all clips are removed.

### Way 3\. Split all clips at once

The Blade command allows you to simultaneously cut selected core storyline segments and related clips.

![cut the chosen clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-6.jpg)

**Tips: How to heal the sliced clips?**

**How should I recover if there is an error in the edited video? Here are 3 methods for you.**

### Way 1: Delete the cut point (by pressing Delete)

You can follow these steps to merge 2 clips by clicking delete:

Step1Move the mouse over the time point you want to remove, then select Delete directly to restore the original full video.

![delete the cut point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

### Way 2: Undo the action (by pressing Command + Z)

You can either click **"Command + Z"** to reverse the process if you want to link the clips back together to repair a clip in the timeline.

### Way 3: merge 2 clips (by clicking &quot; Join Clips&quot;)

Choose two neighboring portions, then select **"Join Clips"** from the drop-down option under "Trim" to join the individual clips together into one.

![merge 2 clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-8.jpg)

**Tips:** These 3 ways only work if the two clips come from the same clip.

## Part 2\. How to split a clip in alternative to Final Cut Pro?

Final Cut Pro is a more complex user to understand; It can sometimes corrupt your file if it isn't saved properly, leading to all your work becoming lost. To save your work, you should do this every 5 minutes to ensure that your work doesn't corrupt. There are limited export settings; you are limited in the formats and sizes you can export from FCPX; whereas before, you could export many codecs and formats out of FCP, you must complete more specific encoding in a compressor.

Therefore, the alternative to Final Cut Pro is Filmora because it allows you to edit, split or merge clips in one go.

### Split a clip in the best alternative to FCP - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

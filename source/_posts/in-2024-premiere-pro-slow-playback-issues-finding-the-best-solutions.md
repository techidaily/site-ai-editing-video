* This puts you in more control of the video rather than improvising the need to zoom in on a video during recording.
* Zoom into the specific part or portion of the video that you find necessary for covering the purpose. You cannot perform such actions while recording a video since the recording is quite restricted across a device.
* Adding zoom in effect across the video gives it a proper effect that enhances the quality rather than depreciating it.

### Disadvantages of Zooming Videos After Recording

* If you put in a zoom in effect on your video, this cannot be reverted back or zoomed out.
* The frame rate of the video is heavily damaged by using such effects across your recorded video. As this is done through the software, there is a guaranteed decrease in the quality output of the video.

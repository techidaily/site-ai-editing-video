Step 3

Double-click on the Default Title once more and simply change the text color to anything other than black this time. Then, click **OK** and take another snapshot. After this, delete the Default Title from the Timeline.

Step 4

Next, go to **Sample Color** and drag the White color to the Timeline. Increase the White Color clip’s duration to 10 seconds by dragging the tail of the clip to the right.

![sample color filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/white.png)

Step 5

For the next step, you need to download a simple [Vignette png image](https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/ihbooTJ%5Feffect-gfx-png-black-vignette-png-transparent-png/). Then, import the Vignette image into Filmora. Go to **My Media** and click on **Import Media.** Import it and drag the image to the Timeline. Then, move that clip to Track 3.

![vignette png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vignette.png)

Step 6

Drop the **Black** snapshot you took earlier to Track 2\. Double-click on it, go to **Animation**, and apply these settings. After this, move the Playhead to the end of the clip and change the **X-axis** value to “**\-800**”.

![snapshot settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black.png)

Step 7

Go to **Effects** and drag the **Square Blur** effect to Track 4 on the Timeline. Increase its duration to match the other clips. Then, click on the effect and change its **Size** bar value to 4\. Click **OK.**

![add effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/effect.png)

Step 8

Place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip. Go to **My Media** and drag the Black snapshot to Track 5\. Double-click on it → go to **Animation** and change the settings to look like this. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds. Here, change the **X-axis** to “**150”** and the **Scale** to **75%.**

![edit snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black-snapshot.png)

Step 9

Now, place the Playhead at the starting point and drag the colored snapshot in Track 6\. Double-click on it and change the **Scale** to **50%**. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds again and change the **Scale** to **75%.** Click **OK.**

Step 10

Go to **Sample Color** and drag “Gradient 4” to Track 7 on the Timeline. Double-click on it → go to the **Video** tab → change the Blending Mode to **Overlay** → decrease the Opacity to **25%.** Click **OK.**

![gradient sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/gradient.png)

Step 11

Drag a Default Title to Track 8 and double-click on it to open its Advanced settings. From here, delete the yellow text clip located under the video. Then, insert a Line shape.

![insert line shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line.png)

Step 12

Increase the Line’s length to be almost as long as the screen. Then adjust its position until half of the Line is visible on the screen. Like this.

![edit shape in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-line.png)

Step 13

Copy this Default Title and paste it into Track 9\. Open its Advanced settings and change the Line color to something different than the previous one. Then, move it to the other side of the screen, slightly above the previous line. Click **OK.**

![add line shapes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lines.png)

Step 14

Now, select the Default Title on Track 9, double-click it, and go to the **Animation** tab. Move the Playhead at the starting point of the Timeline and add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead to the end of the clip. Drag the **X-axis** position to the right until the Line shape moves all the way to the right side of the screen.

Do the same for the Default Title on Track 8\. But this time, drag the **X-axis** position toward the other side. When you’re done, press **OK.**

![animate shapes filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line-move.png)

Step 15

## Guide To Cropping and Combining Content in Wondershare Filmora [Latest]

Video editing is one of the most essential tasks in a video project. It plays a role in creating videos that leave a lasting impression on your audience. From the initial raw footage to the final product, a video goes through several processes. One vital aspect of video editing is **trimming** and **merging**, which holds great importance for any video project.

The editing process changes the whole narrative of a video by adding more depth and feel to it. Through editing, you can remove unwanted segments, rearrange clips, and much more. Capturing and recording video is one thing, but bringing the best out of the raw files is another. To make your raw footage somewhat stunning, you have to sit in the editing room.

## Part 1: How Does Trimming or Merging Videos Help Users?

Merging and trimming videos is an editing technique that offers many benefits. Here's how these actions can help you in so many ways. Find out how it helps the users when they merge or **trim a video:**

### Trimming Videos

* **Trimming** allows users to remove unwanted portions of a video. You can eliminate mistakes, irrelevant footage, or unnecessary pauses in the video. It also helps streamline the content and improve its overall quality.
* It can help adjust the pacing of a video by removing or shortening sections that may be too slow or lengthy. This ensures a more engaging and dynamic viewing experience.
* By trimming, you can select the best moments from a longer video. You can also create highlight reels that showcase the most important or exciting parts.
* Many social media platforms have specific time limitations for videos. It allows you to meet these requirements and share their content without compromising its essence.

### Merging Videos

* The **merging** of videos enables you to combine multiple clips or segments into a single video. This technique is useful when users want to compile footage from different sources. It also creates a uniform narrative from separate scenes.
* Merging allows you to create montages or collages that showcase various moments or perspectives. This is often used in music videos, compilations, or video presentations.

In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-13.jpg)

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’
* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip
* STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical
* STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-16.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-13.jpg)

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’
* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip
* STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-16.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

## Easy Guide to Zoom Video in VLC

Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.

You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.

## Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom

VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.

Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.

Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.

Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.

Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg)

Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg)

Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.

## Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu

Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.

Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.

Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-vlc-zoom-options.jpg)

Otherwise, you can press Shift + Z keys together to try out different zoom options.

## Part 3: Zoom VLC Video Using Magnifier

If you are using VLC Media Player on your Windows desktop computer, you can use the inbuilt Magnifier tool to zoom into a video that you are playing on VLC. You can zoom into videos to read any text in the background but this leads to low resolution and distortion. You can zoom in by 16 times which is the highest among all the three methods. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom video using Magnifier tool.

Step1Open VLC Player and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Start menu on Windows and search for “Magnifier”.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-vlc-video-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Click on Magnifier App. Once it opens, place the mouse pointer on the video and you will see its magnified version.

Step4Press Windows and “+” keys to zoom in while press Windows and “-“ keys to zoom out.

* Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.
* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.
* Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.
* The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don't bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.

## People Also Ask

Before we bid you goodbye, let's answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.

### Q1\. What Is a Logo Intro?

You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn't know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company's logo that features before a movie.

Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.

### Q2\. What Is a Logo Reveal?

Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.

A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.

### Q3\. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?

You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.

![5 rules of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Unique**

It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else's. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else's logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.

**Simple**

Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.

**Versatile**

Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don't exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.

**Scalability**

It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.

**Balanced**

Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn't look aesthetically pleasing.

### Q4\. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?

The seven elements of a good logo include the following.

![7 elements of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Simplicity**

A simple design is far more superior to an overly complicated one. You could draw inspiration from brands like Nike.

**Memorability**

A good logo is one that your audience can remember off-head. Simple doesn't always have to mean simplistic.

**Timelessness**

Trends come and go, but a timeless logo will remain appropriate in the years to come. It is not uncommon for some brands to retain their logos for more than a decade.

**Relevance**

It would be wise to ensure your logo relates to your industry in one way or the other.

**High-quality typography**

The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.

**Well-balanced colors**

Your choice of colors can subconsciously influence your target audience's buying decisions and how they perceive you. For instance, blue communicates honesty and reliability, while yellow elicits feelings of happiness.

**Versatility**

Lastly, it would be wise to ensure that you can use your logo in numerous instances, like on a letterhead or on your social media platforms.

## Conclusion

We cannot dispute a logo's importance to your overall brand image. Your logo helps you communicate your unique message to your target audience and prospective clients. Instead of sticking with the bland, old-fashioned static logo, you have now learned a new way to animate your logo and add some spice. We hope the suggestions in this article will help you create an excellent logo reveal intro video that keeps your audience hooked and craving more.

## Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro

We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let's discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.

* Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn't do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.
* Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.
* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.
* Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.
* The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don't bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.

## People Also Ask

Before we bid you goodbye, let's answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.

### Q1\. What Is a Logo Intro?

You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn't know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company's logo that features before a movie.

Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.

### Q2\. What Is a Logo Reveal?

Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.

A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.

### Q3\. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?

You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.

![5 rules of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Unique**

It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else's. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else's logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.

**Simple**

Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.

**Versatile**

Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don't exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.

**Scalability**

It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.

**Balanced**

Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn't look aesthetically pleasing.

### Q4\. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?

The seven elements of a good logo include the following.

![7 elements of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Simplicity**

A simple design is far more superior to an overly complicated one. You could draw inspiration from brands like Nike.

**Memorability**

A good logo is one that your audience can remember off-head. Simple doesn't always have to mean simplistic.

**Timelessness**

Trends come and go, but a timeless logo will remain appropriate in the years to come. It is not uncommon for some brands to retain their logos for more than a decade.

**Relevance**

It would be wise to ensure your logo relates to your industry in one way or the other.

**High-quality typography**

The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.

**Well-balanced colors**

Your choice of colors can subconsciously influence your target audience's buying decisions and how they perceive you. For instance, blue communicates honesty and reliability, while yellow elicits feelings of happiness.

**Versatility**

Lastly, it would be wise to ensure that you can use your logo in numerous instances, like on a letterhead or on your social media platforms.

## Conclusion

We cannot dispute a logo's importance to your overall brand image. Your logo helps you communicate your unique message to your target audience and prospective clients. Instead of sticking with the bland, old-fashioned static logo, you have now learned a new way to animate your logo and add some spice. We hope the suggestions in this article will help you create an excellent logo reveal intro video that keeps your audience hooked and craving more.

## Want to Convert MP4 Video To 60 FPS GIF? Read This

GIFs have become a popular way to share short and engaging videos online. They are widely used on social media platforms and messaging apps, making it easy to share moments, reactions, and emotions with friends and family. But not all GIFs are created equal. Some GIFs can look choppy and low-quality, detracting from the viewing experience.

To improve the quality of your GIFs, you can convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS (frames per second). This will give your GIFs a smooth, fluid motion that looks professional and visually appealing. In this article, we'll go over the steps you need to follow to convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS GIFs and create high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.

![convert mp4 video to 60 fps gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-mp4-video-60-fps-gif.JPG)

## Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?

GIFs are a great way to share short, eye-catching videos online, but not all are made the same. GIFs with low frame rates tend to look choppy, and the motion could be smoother, making the video look unprofessional and detracting from the overall viewing experience. On the other hand, GIFs with higher frame rates look smoother, and the motion is more fluid, making the video more visually appealing.

Converting your MP4 videos to GIFs has several benefits:

* **Smoother Motion:** By converting MP4s to GIFs, you increase the frame rate of your GIFs, giving them a smoother and more fluid motion.
* **Increased Detail:** Higher frame rates allow for more detail and clarity in fast-moving scenes, making the video more engaging and easier to watch.
* **Reduced Ghosting:** A higher frame rate reduces the "ghosting" effect in low-frame rate GIFs, making the video clearer and reducing distractions.
* **High-Quality Videos:** Converting MP4s to GIFs eliminates the ghosting effect and creates high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.
* **Increased Engagement:** High-quality GIFs will engage and entertain your audience, making them more likely to share and interact with your content.

Converting MP4s to GIFs is a great way to improve the overall quality of your GIFs and create visually appealing videos that are perfect for sharing online. Whether you're sharing a reaction, a moment, or an emotion, a high-quality GIF will engage and entertain your audience.

### Can I Get a 60 FPS GIF?

While it's true that many people search for 60 FPS GIFs, it's important to understand that there is no such thing as a true 60 FPS GIF.

![60 fps gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-gif.jpg)

GIFs are an image format designed to display simple animations. [GIF files store delay time between frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) which is defined as multiples of 1/100th of a second. Value 1 would give you 100 FPS; value 2 would already have half of 100 FPS, that is, 50 FPS; value 3 would give you 33.3 FPS GIF, etc. So there are 20 FPS GIFs, 33.3 FPS GIFs, 50 FPS GIFs, and 100 FPS GIFs.

In addition, many websites or programs (including Google Chrome) ignore value 1 (100 FPS GIFs) and default to a much slower animation speed when viewing GIF files. Therefore, 100 FPS GIFs are technically possible but are rarely used. Value 2 (50 FPS) is the most you can get.

If you want to create high-quality animations, consider using MP4s or alternative image formats better suited for high frame rates and detailed animations.

That being said, some websites may have a "60 FPS GIFs" category, but it's important to understand that most of the content in these categories is not 60 FPS. Instead, it's likely to be either an MP4 video or a GIF with a lower frame rate, like 50 FPS, labeled as "60 FPS" for marketing purposes.

## Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?

Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 60 FPS GIF maker. As mentioned before, there is no 60 FPS GIF, so it is impossible to create a 60 FPS GIF using traditional methods. However, many excellent video-to-GIF converters in the market allow you to set the GIF frame rate.

These video-to-GIF converters allow you to convert MP4 videos to GIFs with a higher frame rate, which can give your GIFs a smoother and more fluid motion. While these GIFs may not be 60 FPS, they can still provide a significant quality improvement compared to traditional GIFs.

## People Also Ask

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:

#### Q1\. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?

It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n/100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1/100 second (100 FPS), 2/100 second (50 FPS), 3/100 second (33.33 FPS), 4/100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333.../100 second (30 FPS).

#### Q2\. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?

To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.

#### Q3\. What FPS Should a GIF Be?

GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it's possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.

#### Q4\. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?

The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.

## Conclusion

GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.

There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.

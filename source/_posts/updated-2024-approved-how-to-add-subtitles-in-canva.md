## Part 3: How to Use AI Slow Motion Videos for High-Quality Edits?

Now that you have been made aware of plenty of the **slow-motion AI** tools, let's move forward. Although operating all these tools is easy for proficient results, you must master them. Here is a detailed guide to two of the above **AI slow-motion** tools:

### 1\. RunwayML

Editing a video from simple to slow motion is very laidback with this tool. The AI does most of the work, and you need to give a few directions. Here is a step-by-step guide to using this **slow-mo AI** tool:

**Step 1:** Once logged in and reached its editing interface, navigate towards the left panel. Then, opt for the "Edit videos" option under the "Video" section. From the display menu, locate and select the "Super-Slow Motion" option.

![access the super slow motion option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/filmora-ai-slow-motion-video-creation-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** In the Super Slow Motion window, click the "Upload" option and drop a file.

**Step 3:** Once the video has been uploaded, modify the speed of the video. You can do this by accessing the “Speed” slider at the right. After editing, click the “Process” button to finalize the slow-motion settings. The edited video will appear on the screen; play it to see if the results are satisfactory. Then, click the "Export" button at the right to download the video.

### 2\. Neural Love

This is another **slow-motion AI** tool for those with little knowledge of creating slow-mo. It uses AI tech to facilitate users and automate the major editing elements. Following are the steps to operate this online tool seamlessly:

**Step 1:** After accessing this tool, click the "Upload Video" button to import media. Once the import progress is completed, the tool will analyze your video.

**Step 2:** Scroll down and set the percentage slider for slowing down the video. You can also select to upscale your video or change its frame rate. Moreover, you can select to colorize the video as well.

**Step 3:** Click the "Start Full Video Processing" button after setting preferences. Once you have subscribed to a plan, the video slow motion will be ready.

## Part 4: Desktop Alternative: Slowing Down Videos Using AI With Wondershare Filmora

Indeed, all these tools are experts in what they do. However, they all have some drawbacks. All these **slow-motion AI** tools require internet access to create a slow-mo. In such circumstances, users require a desktop tool that masters this task. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an efficient tool for creating videos slow-mo with ease. Amongst **slow-motion AI**, it has other AI features, a resource library, and custom setting options.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Speed Ramping for Creating Slow Motion in Wondershare Filmora

This feature can do everything, whether it's about creating slow motion or speeding up your video. You can customize the speed of your video at specific frame rates with this. In addition, there are 6 pre-assembled speed ramping presets that you can apply. All presets are popular and tailored to fit most of the video contexts.

Along with speed, you can also maintain the audio pitch to align with the speed of the video. The feature later uses AI assistance in frame interpolation to smooth the added effect. There are 3 options for AI frame interpolation, and one of them is Optical Flow. This option helps with bringing smoothness to your **AI slow-motion** videos. In short, Filmora offers a professional ground for making a slow-mo.

### Guide to Manage Speed Ramping in Wondershare Filmora

Now that you know its speed ramping option, it is time to try it. Although Filmora rules out the technicalities, there is still much to learn. In this section, find the step-by-step guide to creating a **slow-motion AI** video:

##### Step 1Import Files and Access the Speed Ramping Option

Once you have created a new project in Filmora, use the "Ctrl + I" keys to import files. After that, bring this clip to the timeline and select it. Navigate towards the right-side panel and go to the "Speed > Speed Ramping" tab. Under this tab, choose a preset or the "Customize" option to set a speed.

![adjust speed ramping values](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/filmora-ai-slow-motion-video-creation-10.jpg)

##### Step 2Enable Optical Flow Option

Once you have set speed preferences, reach the “AI Frame Interpolation” section at the bottom. From there, select the “Optical Flow” option to add extra frames. The AI will smoothen out the slow-motion effect in your video on its own.

![enable optical flow option for smoothness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/filmora-ai-slow-motion-video-creation-11.jpg)

##### Step 3Enable Render Preview to See Results

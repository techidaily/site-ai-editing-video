## How to Edit Recorded Video

The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don't need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.

Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you're on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don't have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we've put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you'll need to know to make stunning films, even if you've never done it before. We'll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.

## **Part 1\. Edit Recorded Video in OBS**

OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It's open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.

**Step 1\. Download and Install OBS**

Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.

**Step 2\. Setup Screen Recording**

The window is divided into separate parts called "docks" when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you'll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.

![obs setup screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg)

You'll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).

**Step 3\. Customize the Recording Source**

You'll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select "Display Capture" by clicking the "+" icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click "OK". At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.

![obs customize the recording source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg)

**Step 4\. Start/Stop Recording**

You'll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you're ready to begin recording. When you're finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.

![obs start stop recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-start-stop-recording.jpg)

## **Part 3\. Edit Recorded Video with Zoom**

Trimming and editing Zoom recordings is a necessary for digging out value-packed nuggets from captured footage. But although you already know this, you’re probably putting off doing so as you’re anticipating you’ll need to learn a ton of new tools to edit Zoom recordings.

### Steps to Record Videos with Zoom

**Step 1**For the cloud recordings, go to zoom.us and log in to your account. Then, navigate to ‘Settings’ from the navigation menu on the left.

![zoom settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-settings.jpg)

**Step 2** Under Advanced cloud recording options, tick the option for ‘Optimize the recording for 3rd party video editor’ and click ‘Save’.

![zoom genral recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-genral-recording.jpg)

**Step 4**To really edit a Zoom recording, whether it’s stored on your PC or Zoom cloud, you need to utilize third-party video editing software. But no worries, you don’t need any sophisticated equipment or software here.

## **Part 4\. Edit Recorded Video in Teams**

Teams gives the opportunity to record your online meetings. This may be especially beneficial for sharing meeting recordings with individuals unable to attend live, to preserve instructional material for future use, or to enable participants to revisit prior meeting topics. At the top of the meeting window, a message will appear stating that the recording has begun, which alerts participants that their interactions in the meeting may be recorded by the recording. You will also notice a recording sign and the duration of the recording in the top-left corner of the meeting window.

### Steps to Record Videos with Teams

**Step 1** Open Microsoft Teams on Windows and Mac.

**Step 2** Go to appropriate Teams or Channel and click on the Video button at the top to create a video call.

![teams video button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/teams-video-button.jpg)

**Step 3**Invite people and organize a meeting. Whenever you feel you need to record any significant point, click on the three-dot menu at the top.

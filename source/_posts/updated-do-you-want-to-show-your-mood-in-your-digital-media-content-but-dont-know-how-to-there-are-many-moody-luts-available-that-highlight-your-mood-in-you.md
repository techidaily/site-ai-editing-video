## Step by Step to Add Border to Video Using Premiere Pro

The border is really important as it frames up all the video. It makes the video eye-catching and gives a vivid effect. It also fixes the automated cropping issues, especially on Instagram. Along with this, it helps the viewers to watch the video as you can add effects about fun, travel, guides and etc. accordingly. Adding a border is super easy and it’s not more than fun!

So let’s start…

## **How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro**

Today we are going to discuss how to add borders to the video clips or images in premiere pro. It’s pretty simple to make borders of different colors and sizes for your video clips.

So, here are the two different ways we can use to add borders to our videos or images.

1. Adding a border to the video using a grid effect
2. Adding a border to the video using the essential graphics panel

### **Way 1\.** **Using a Grid Effect**

While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.

Let’s start step by step.

* Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.
* Hit the **Effects** tab and write the **grid** in the search panel.
* Simply drag the **grid** option into the timeline of the videos.

* Select the **anchor value** to **0** for the x and y.
* Change the **size** to **width and height slider.**
* Change the **width** to **1920** and **height** to **1080**.

Now we have borders added as you can see below.

You can also change the width of the borders.

* Change the **width** to **30**.

You have the option to change the color of the border.

* Select the **blending mode** to **normal**.
* Select the **color picker** tool and change the color of your desire.

### **Way 2\.** **Using the Essential Graphics Panel**

First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.

Let’s dive in…

Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.

* **Import** the videos and drag them into the timeline.
* Select the **effects**
* Find **“alpha adjust”** and drag it into the effects control.

* Create a **4-point polygon mask**.

A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.

* Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.

* Again go to effect controls, under **opacity** hit **invert alpha**.
* Under **mask** hit **inverted**.

## **Conclusion**

They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders. You can use any one of them to make your borders and can easily engage viewers in your videos.

In all of the above applications, I recommend you to use **Wondershare filmora 11**. It is the most professional software and makes your video stand out.

**Way 1\.** **Using a Grid Effect**

While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.

You have the option to change the color of the border.

* Select the **blending mode** to **normal**.
* Select the **color picker** tool and change the color of your desire.

### **Way 2\.** **Using the Essential Graphics Panel**

## **Conclusion**

We have discussed different software to add borders. All the software and tools are free to use. Similarly, they can be used on both Mac as well as Windows. They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders. You can use any one of them to make your borders and can easily engage viewers in your videos.

In all of the above applications, I recommend you to use **Wondershare filmora 11**. It is the most professional software and makes your video stand out.

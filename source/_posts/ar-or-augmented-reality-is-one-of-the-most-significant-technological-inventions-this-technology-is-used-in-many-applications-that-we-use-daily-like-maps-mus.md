## Part 2 The Value of a Lightroom Collage

In a single picture, you can only see part of a story, but **collage lightroom** tells you more about that. It helps by refreshing all the memories of a trip, function, and more in a single frame.

They have gained huge popularity in the last few years as the digital space has grown. You may have already seen social media users posting their photo collages on their timelines. Instagram is far ahead of the competition in this regard. It has played a crucial role in establishing the photo collage as a normal trend.

**For the photographer**

With a photo collage, a photographer can best showcase his talent. It shows that you can do a lot more than your capabilities, like representing stories by blending colors and elements perfectly. This will help you attract your prospects and convert them into your paying customers.

**How do photo collages provide value to the clients?**

A photo collage provides visual value to the clients by enhancing the creative process. It can have a profound effect on the way they perceive your art of photography. In fact, your clients will love to see all their memories collected in an attractive photo collage. There are a lot of people that even love to present collages to their loved ones.

## Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage

The secret to designing an eye-catching **lightroom collage** is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.

**Balance**

Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.

**Alignment**

Don't underestimate the importance of alignment in **Lightroom collage**. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.

In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.

**Proximity**

Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:

**●** Realistic pictures should be put together.

**●** Unrelatable images should be separated.

Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.

**Theme**

The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it's not as measurable as others.

### Edit Beyond Basic with AI Video Editing Features of Filmora

This part of the article will highlight some of the prominent video editing features of Filmora. The uniqueness of these features lies in their AI-backed algorithms. You can give directions according to your video, and AI will operate accordingly. Here are some of its video editing features that you’ll come across upon entering:

#### 1\. [Remove Background](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

With this feature of Filmora, you can remove the background of your videos and images. The AI-integrated technology preserves the object while removing the background. In addition, you can add a solid color, gradient, or custom background for it.

#### 2\. [Auto Reframe](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Creating reels for Instagram or crafting YouTube shorts has some requirements. To preserve the integrity and visuals of content, it is important to fit a video. With this AI, you can set the required frame resolution. Along with that, it preserves the pixel quality of the video while resizing the frame.

#### 3\. [AI Smart Masking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora offers multiple mask options to infuse effects and filters to specific parts. However, the V13 upgrade introduced an AI masking feature for improved results. By enabling this feature, you can choose to mask objects or backgrounds.

#### 4\. [AI Thumbnail Creator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Thumbnails increase video views by evoking the audience's interest in seeing a video. In Filmora, you can employ the AI Thumbnail creator to auto-create thumbnails. It analyzes the best frame out of your video and chooses it as a thumbnail. You can further apply many templates to this thumbnail according to context.

## Conclusion

This article has expanded your knowledge and expertise about two powerful video editors. With **how to slow down video in After Effects**, we introduced you to the software. There is no limitation of features in either software as both bring out the best in videos.

However, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as it is a more accessible alternative. Creating a slow-mo in this software is easier and requires no effort. In addition, you can also access its built-in effects and presets for task productivity.

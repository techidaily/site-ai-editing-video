Discord was a great alternative to voice chat systems such as TeamSpeak, Mumble, and Ventrilo for online gamers. Gamers **make discord accounts** for these services to play together rather than the voice communication facilities integrated into games, which are frequently of poor quality and lack functionality.

Founded in 2015, discord allowed individuals to talk while playing PC games seamlessly. Users may utilize the service to establish servers that can include many text and audio channels. A typical **discord account** server may feature chat rooms dedicated to specific themes (such as "gaming" and "anime x manga"), as well as voice channels devoted to specific games or activities. The service's high-quality, low-latency audio chat is a popular tool for Twitch broadcasters and podcasters. It has also expanded to accommodate massive video conversations to compete with Zoom.

## What Is Color Finale

The question of which is superior between Color Finale and DaVinci Resolve may have crossed your mind if you're considering upgrading your color grading software. That's very natural, too! These two programs for color grading and color correction are among the best options for intermediate to advanced video editors. And with good cause. But what distinguishes each piece of software? Keep reading to find out.

Compared to the default Final Cut Pro coloring tools, it offers a significantly more detailed coloring experience. It's also shockingly simple to use. After installing it, Color Finale 2 will be accessible under "Video Effects." Simply drag and drop it onto the desired clips to use it. Alternately, make an adjustment layer and apply it to your entire video.

The use of curves, vectors, color wheels, and HSL curves will be available to editors. These can all be utilized in layers. Additionally, rearranging and modifying the layers is simple. The masking and an enhanced LUTs browser are two of Color Finale 2's finest additions. Masks are easy to handle and apply to video clips, and they have a great tracking capability. This makes it simpler for editors to isolate particular colors or sections inside film for intricate coloring.

Additionally, with Color Finale 1, the LUTs browser has been improved. LUTs are now much simpler to go through and preview. Additionally, Color Finale can be shown the location of your computer's favorite LUTs for rapid application. Alternately, you might make your own LUTs and store them for use in later projects. These resources offer a wide range of color options.

**Transcoder**: Color Finale Transcoder is an FCPX addon that lets you preview, alter, and transcode RAW files. BRAW, ARRIRAW, and CinemaDNG are supported. As Final Cut Pro X natively supports R3D/ProRes RAW files, there's no necessity to support them. Inside the extension, you can change the transcoding codec, color space, output file resolution, delayering mode, and highlight recovery. Color Finale Transcoder lets you change RAW files' color temperature/tint, ISO, and sharpness/detail. Import a preview LUT to see how your film will look.

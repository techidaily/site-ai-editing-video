* [How Can I Create Easily a Montage Video?](#part3)

## Part 1\. Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film

Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the **call of duty montage**.

In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.

Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie "Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual/metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).

### 3 Top Montages in Film for All Times

If the above two examples did not fully express **what is a montage video**, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.

**1\. Rocky (1976)**

One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer "Rocky". The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots' full training progression process.

To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character's passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.

**2\. Mulan (1998)**

Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.

Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character's struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX5zkYnGB0) to get an idea of how music and visuals can partner for tonal video montages.

**3\. Creed (2015)**

Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.

Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky's health deterioration against Creed's training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NH1A6CLIrY) to understand **what is a montage video** of the tonal type.

## Part 2\. Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media

Of course, movies and TV shows are the only types of media where video montage techniques are useful. Many non-professionals use options like a **fortnite montage editor** to create and edit montage videos for other projects they can share across platforms. Some even create video montages to create videos for social media.

These include vlog-like videos that people record and then edit together into a montage which different techniques. Plus, some users create montages of different things that interest them, like gameplay. Then, they share those videos across social media for views, like on TikTok or YouTube.

### · Gaming Montages

Different creators focus on developing **gaming montage**s to create projects for the games they operate. These can include videos showcasing the skills or gameplays of the creation, all explaining a specific theme in some cases.

There are different games that the users focus on for showcasing their gaming prowess in action. Common examples include Fortnite, Call of Duty, CSGO, or **PUBG montage** videos.

### · Wedding Montages

Many users turn to edit video montages for specific occasions, adding clips of different moments instead of one long-running documentary. They incorporate stylish effects like slow motion and transitions, incorporate a moving background score, and more.

Many top influencers and celebrities have used this technique for their wedding videos on social media. Additionally, regular people also adopt the style.

## How to Concatenate Videos Using FFmpeg

Video editing is a crucial aspect of creating content for many people. Whether you're a YouTuber, a marketer, or just someone who wants to share videos with friends and family, being able to edit and manipulate your videos is key. One of the most basic video editing tasks is concatenating videos, which combines multiple files to create one cohesive video.

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to do just that, and in this guide, we'll walk you through the process of FFmpeg concatenate videos. Whether a beginner or an experienced video editor, this guide will provide you with all the information you need to seamlessly merge your videos. From installation to execution, we'll cover it all so you can streamline your video editing process.

![concat videos with ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ffmpeg-concat-videos.JPG)

## Overview and Installation of FFmpeg

FFmpeg is free, open-source project that allows you to record, convert, and stream digital audio and video. It is a command-line tool widely used in video editing and transcoding. FFmpeg can be used to concatenate videos and other tasks, such as adding subtitles, changing video resolution, and more. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a versatile and accessible tool for anyone to use.

Here's how to install FFmpeg:

Step1 **Log in** to your Ubuntu server via SSH and **update** the package index.

_$ sudo apt update_

Step2 **Install** FFmpeg and all the required dependencies

_$ sudo apt install ffmpeg_

Step3 **Verify** the version of FFmpeg that you've installed.

_$ ffmpeg -version_

## Prerequisite

Before we merge videos using FFmpeg, we must understand the various methods available to us. FFmpeg offers three ways to concatenate videos: a demuxer, a filter, or a protocol. However, each method has its own set of considerations, and the best method for you will depend on the properties of the videos you're working with.

It's crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you're merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It's essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.

### Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg "concat" demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn't require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the "concat" demuxer and "concat" protocols in FFmpeg.

**Merge Videos With the "Concat" Demuxer**

The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Create** a **.txt file and list** the paths of the video files you want to merge.

_Join\_video.txt_

_file /Users/Video/input1.mp4_

_file /Users/Video/input2.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can add more than two video files.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

![filmora export video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-05.png)

## Conclusion

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to concatenate videos in various ways. Whether you're working with videos of the same codecs and resolutions or videos with multiple audio streams, FFmpeg can handle it. However, for users new to video editing or needing experience with command-line tools, using Filmora can be a more user-friendly option. It offers a simple drag-and-drop interface and a variety of features and effects to enhance the overall look of your video.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

## How to Zoom Picture in Picture [Easy Solution]

Zoom is one of the greatest options on the market for video conferencing. It doesn't matter whether you use it at home or in an office environment; it will quickly link the team members. One of the most popular video conferencing programs is Zoom. When in-person meetings aren't feasible, it enables you to communicate electronically with employees, and it's been a major popularity for social occasions as well. In case you're not acquainted, picture-in-picture mode enables you to watch videos from one app while using your PC normally. The movie will keep playing in a tiny thumbnail window so that two applications may work simultaneously on your smartphone.

You may create virtual audio and video conferences, webinars, live chats, screen sharing, and other collaboration tools with Zoom, a cloud-based video communications solution. Zoom's most recent iPhone apps let you dismiss a Zoom Meeting while keeping the Zoom video call open in a picture-in-picture mode. To join a Zoom conference, you don't need an account, and because the software works with Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android devices, nearly anybody can use it. Since using Zoom's picture-in-picture mode is the same as using it with other applications, you shouldn't have any trouble if you often use PiP mode. Here are the top 4 methods you can refer to picture in picture in Zoom.

## Method 1: Swap Shared Screen with Video

You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Before leaving the meeting if you're not giving a presentation or speaking, you should definitely mute Zoom on your iPhone to prevent noises from your typing or other activities from entering the conversation. Additionally, keep in mind to switch off the camera if you're engaged in something distracting, at least for the duration of your activity. To reopen the Zoom Meeting and go back to the Zoom app, touch the Picture-in-Picture mode pane. Here are some actions to keep in mind:

### Steps to Swap Shared Screen for Zoom Picture in Picture

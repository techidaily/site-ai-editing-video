## Mastering the Technique: Playing Videos in Slow Motion on Your iPhone Like a Pro

Before we dive into **how to play a video in slow motion on iPhone**, let's see what they are. In slow motion, the video frame rate is usually manipulated.

Artificial Intelligence is the replacement of human processes by machines and computer systems. It can replicate intelligent human behaviors, including facial expression recognition, problem-solving, and learning.

**AI video interviewing**, an increasingly popular assessment tool driven by artificial intelligence, is being incorporated by many large companies that receive thousands of job applications. AI electronically analyses many aspects of a video interview, including the candidate's body language, facial expressions, word choices, and tone of voice. It can also track eye movements to determine whether candidates are looking at resources around them.

With the introduction of artificial intelligence, many tech companies and individuals have taken a likeness of it and have grown to utilize it to carry out tasks. Reconsider your position as applicants get selected by assessing their performance in the **AI-based video interview** against a large inventory of facial and linguistic information.

#### In this article

01 [How AI is Being Used in a Job Interview](#Part 1)

02 [How to Ace an AI Video Interview](#Part 2)

03 [Role of AI in a Video Interview](#Part 3)

04 [Role of AI in Video Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How AI is being used in a job interview.**

In most cases, **an AI video interview** is the initial stage in the hiring process, in place of or in addition to a typical cover letter and CV. It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

### 01**Prepare for the interview differently.**

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

When in an **AI interview**, you need to prepare differently. It's not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

Remember that you're having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

Most **artificial intelligence video interviews** take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it's essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

There won't be a human at the other end of the camera, so there's no need to dress up, right? That's wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.

Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.

### 05**Practice before the interview.**

![Practice Before the Interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-5.jpeg)

To ace an **AI interview**, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an **AI interview**. To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye
        Contact and Neutral Voice Tone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-8.jpeg)

During an **AI video interview**, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don't have to strain to see into it.

02 [How to Ace an AI Video Interview](#Part 2)

03 [Role of AI in a Video Interview](#Part 3)

04 [Role of AI in Video Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How AI is being used in a job interview.**

In most cases, **an AI video interview** is the initial stage in the hiring process, in place of or in addition to a typical cover letter and CV. It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye
        Contact and Neutral Voice Tone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-8.jpeg)

## Part 3 **Role of AI in a video interview**

![AI in Job interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-11.jpg)

AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates' responses. Many significant companies use **AI video interviews** or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant's performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company's ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate's speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.

## Part 4 **Role of AI in video making**

In video production, artificial intelligence has proven faster and more efficient than humans. It's also more cost-effective and time-saving than hiring a video editor. It allows you to edit more films in a shorter amount of time. It streamlines your job by taking care of most of the burden, making video editing simple even for beginners. AI makes suggestions that the user may not consider, making video production more accessible and engaging. Automating color correction and scene recognition in films improves the visual experience and aids in the formulation of personalized messaging.

## Detailed Tutorial to Resize Your Video in VLC

Videos are one of the most popular types of content on the internet. There are millions of videos uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, and other video-sharing sites each day. Sharing your videos with others is possible when you know how to resize them in VLC. VLC is a free media player that allows you to convert or compress your videos in order to make them smaller for uploading or downloading.

Videos are a great way to showcase your business, company, or product on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But what happens when you use the wrong size for your video? The whole thing looks distorted and low quality. It's not very appealing.

Luckily, resizing videos in VLC is simple. All you need is the right software and the right steps.

This blog post will walk you through how to resize videos using VLC. We'll cover what the default settings are for video resolutions, how to change them, and why it's important to know what size of video you're uploading before uploading it.

So without further ado, let's get started!

## Step by step to resize your video in VLC

Anyone who has a lot of videos on their computer knows how frustrating it can be to find the video you want among the hundreds of ones you have. Well, VLC makes it possible to resize your videos so they'll fit onto your desktop. Here's how:

### Resizing by converting to a smaller file size

Because some video formats, such as MKV and AVI, take up too much space, it's a good idea to convert videos to smaller formats, such as FLV, WMV, and so on. To lower the video size, you'll be pleased to learn that VLC allows you to convert video/audio files without the need to install any other software. The video conversion guide for VLC can be found below.

Step 1: Launch the VLC Media Player.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-1.png)

Step 2: Go to the menu and pick Media > Convert/Save from the drop-down menu, then Add > Convert/Save from the drop-down menu.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-2.png)

Step 3: Choose a profile for the video you wish to convert.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-3.png)

Step 4: Select the Start button to start VLC video compression.

### Resizing by cutting unnecessary video segment

Step 1: Launch the VLC Media Player

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-4.png)

Step 2: Go to Menu > View Menu > Advanced Controls in VLC Media Player and select it from the menu.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-5.png)

Step 3: Play the video you want to crop and then click the Record button on the scene you want to crop and then the same button to pause the video where you want to crop it.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-6.png)

Step 4: In Windows 7, 8, and XP, the film will automatically save in Library > Videos, and in My Documents > My Videos in Windows 7.

VLC Media Player is unquestionably one of the greatest video players available for free. Nonetheless, it isn't the finest video reduction because it just reduces the size of videos by using certain simple parameters rather than complex ones. As a result, we offer Fimora, an all-in-one video toolbox that can convert, compress, download, record, edit, burn, and more, as a better video compressor. You can change the video resolution, bit rate, encoder, format, and other settings to compress video and audio files in a variety of formats. Follow the simple steps below to get this VLC compressor replacement on your Windows/Mac for free.

Step 4: Keep in mind that changing one dimension of a video clip will affect both its width and height proportionally. For example, if you enlarge a 16:9 widescreen clip to 720p (from 480p), it will be double its original proportions (720x480).

Then, in the "Settings" panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by choosing a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. When it comes to video formats, you can choose among FLV, MP4, and other similar formats, which normally result in smaller files.

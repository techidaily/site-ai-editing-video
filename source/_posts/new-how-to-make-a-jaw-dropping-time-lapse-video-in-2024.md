## Part 1: What is Time Lapse?

### 1\. Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography

Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).

Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.

The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 = RT

### 2\. What is a Time-lapse video used for?

The use of time-lapse photography and video is an excellent storytelling technique since compelling stories are essential to effective marketing. A time-lapse can also offer excellent insight into the advancement of developmental projects.

#### **①** Scientific research

* Time-lapses may be utilized to spread the word about scientific investigations to a wide audience. You can use time-lapse photography to gain money by selling the material of interesting scientific investigations to documentary makers or instructional websites.
* Scientists can visualize processes that would be challenging or sometimes even impossible to study in real life, thanks to time-lapse photography

#### **②** Individual enjoyment

Time-lapses are also utilized by filmmakers for scenes requiring extended durations of time with little significant activity occurring during the shot (such as night slowly turning into day).

#### **③** **Commercial use**

* Time-lapse videos are a wonderful instrument for enhancing the perception of your brand because they are. As a result, many consumers find it interesting.
* Time-lapse videos are the epitome of the old saying that "good things come in small packages" for any brand.

### 3\. How to Make a Time-lapse video?

## Part 2: Record or Shoot Your Time-Lapse Video

### 1\. Select Your Subject

The best way to create a time-lapse video is to pick your subject very carefully. Movement is the most crucial factor to consider while selecting a time-lapse subject. Any movement—whether it be caused by people, animals, vehicles, water, clouds, or anything else—can create an exciting and captivating time-lapse.

![What is a Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-01.jpg)

What is a Lower Third

A lower third is text and/or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.

A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.

Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.

## 2\. Why Add A Lower Third

So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”

Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.

In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.

![Why Add A Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-02.jpg)

Why Add A Lower Third

Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.

As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Tips:** A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.

## 3\. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third

As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.

[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.

Tip #1

###### Use Readable Font

Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.

Tip #2

###### Don’t Make It Too Long

There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.

Tip #3

###### Use Branding

A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.

Tip #4

###### Use Templates

Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.

Tip #5

###### Keep It Simple

Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don't use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.

Tip #6

###### Emphasize With Your Lower Third

Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.

## What Is VHS?

Since its introduction in 1976, VHS has been the most frequently used video cassette recording technology. The VHS format is a consumer-level analog video cassette recording standard for videotaping. The acronym VHS referred to Vertical Helical Scan and was eventually modified as the popularity of this technology increased.

Produced by a Japan Victor Company, the technology uses a magnetic tape measuring half an inch. By the 1950s, magnetic tape video recording had become a vital part of the television industry. The technology is exclusively utilized in professional settings like TV studios and medical imaging (fluoroscopy).

As consumer access to videotape increased in the 1970s, a new economy centered on home video emerged, drastically altering the economics of the film and television industries.

The original standard has a picture quality equivalent to that of analog television. High-definition television content could be recorded and re-created using digital VHS (D-VHS). Progressively, a new format was launched dubbed S-VHS (Super VHS), which featured improved video quality from 240 to 400 lines; however, people did not use it extensively.

VHS tape, compared to its competition at the time, Betamax tapes had longer tape lifespans. VHS tapes were preferred because they recorded three times as long as Betamax tapes because of their higher storage capacity.

The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.

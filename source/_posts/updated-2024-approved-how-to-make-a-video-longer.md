## How To Make A Video Longer

These days when you head on to social media, you can easily find 4-5 seconds video clips on the internet. However, many social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and other videos sharing platforms require you to make your video longer to meet the site’s minimum length requirements. So, for example, although Instagram’s minimum length is 3 seconds, you might want to find ways to engage your audience longer.

This article will describe the best ways to make a video longer. We’ll also offer a bonus tip on how you can edit your video to make it look better and attract more audience. On that note, let’s take a look.

**6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer**

There are many methods out there to make your video longer. This section will touch on the six best methods to make a video longer.

**Loop the Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-1.jpg)

One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.

Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.

**Slow Down the Video Speed**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg)

We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.

**Add an Intro and Outro**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg)

Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.

It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.

**Add Images to the Video**

This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.

**Boomerang Your Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg)

If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.

Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.

**Add More Content to Your Video Clip**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg)

Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.

Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.

## How to Create Datamoshing Effect to Your Footage in After Effects?

Experimenting with new effects and filters has become part and parcel of life, especially for creative professionals. Datamoshing is a similar effect that displays errors and flaws in the video clips to leave an impression on the audience. In most terms, the datamoshing effect shares similarities with the glitch effect.

Henceforth, the write-up shall focus on the introduction of this effect along with its workability. The procedure to create datamosh After Effects would also be covered. So, let us begin!

#### In this article

01 [What is the Datamoshing Effect?](#part1)

02 [How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?](#part2)

03 [Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)](#part3)

04 [How to Do Datamoshing Effect with Datamosh Plugin in After Effects](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Datamoshing Effect?

Before going into the depths of workability and operation of the datamoshing effect in After Effects, let us understand the effect in detail. The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.

In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.

Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.

## Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?

The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.

Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.

The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.

The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.

The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.

## Part 3: Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)

Understanding the datamosh After Effects is one thing, and incorporating it in your footage is another. The section shall walk you through the step-by-step guide to create the After Effects' datamoshing effect without a plugin. So, let's go, shall we?

### Step 1: Preliminary Process

The first step is easy. Open After Effects from your system. Import the targeted video that needs the datamosh effect. After that, head to the "Content-Aware Fill" to begin the process.

![tap on content aware fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Creating the Reference Frame

Use the playhead where you wish to create the effect, and then click on "Create Reference Frame." The picture frame opens in Photoshop, and the user is expected to save it. Now, go back to the After Effects.

![create reference frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Smearing Process

Now, hide the top layer so that the smearing can occur. Turn the Masks to "None" so that you can perform the masking. Split the second layer to duplicate the layer as we make changes to it. Set the "Masks" to "Subtract and then add a refine soft matte.

![ smearing process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-3.jpg)

### Step 4: Pre-composing the Clip

It is important to pre-compose the clip, so right-click on the timeline and hit "Pre-compose" to the menu list that appears. Tick mark "Move all attributes into the new composition" and rename the clip afterward. Hit "OK."

![pre-compose clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Rendering Queue

Double-click on the timeline, hold shift and drag it until the clip snaps. Press "B" on your keyboard and "N" on the other side to snap the work area. Navigate to "File" and "Export" and then click on "Render Queue."

![render queue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-5.jpg)

### Step 6: Generating Fill Layer

Import the file when it is done rendering and drag it to the timeline. Trim the work area again using B and N buttons from the keyboard. Ensure that the fill method is "Surface," and the range is "Work Area." Click on "Generate Fill Layer" to start the analyzing process.

![generate fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-6.jpg)

### Step 7: Creating the Transition

The user is expected to create a transition between the two shots. Use the track matte to make solid and fractal noise. In the "Noise and Grain" section, click on "Fractal noise" and then switch the fractal type to "Basic." Now, keyframe the "Brightness" and simultaneously turn its level to black and white to create a transition.

![create transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Achieving a Glitchy Effect

To give the glitchy effect, head to the "Effects and Presets" and hit "Posterize," and reduce its level to a couple of integers. Pull the transition down to the fill layer and set it to "Luma Matte." It will showcase the halo sign that we masked around the image.

![create glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Have a Finer Imprint

To eliminate it, use the "Set Matte" channel and alter its layer to the one we pre-composed. Now, invert the matte. Moving on, navigate to the "Simple Choker" and reduce it to one pixel. For perfection, duplicate it and get a finer imprint.

![customize simple choker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-9.jpg)

### Step 10: Final Process

Duplicate the grey solid and then extend the second clip to our fill. In the last step, change the layer of the second clip to "Luma Matte" and save the video. You are done with the process.

![change to luma matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-10.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Do Datamoshing Effect with Datamosh Plugin in After Effects

With its plugin, this sub-section revolves around creating the datamosh effect in After Effects. So, let us begin!

### Step 1: Rendering the Work Area

Open After Effects and click on the (+) sign to set the in and out points. Click on the "Datamosh" to render the work area. The timeline will showcase the clip. Click on "Remove Frames" from the left panel and add a new mosh marker by pressing the (+) button beside "Remove Frames."

![add mosh maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-11.jpg)

### Step 2: I-Frame Removal

The new remove frame marker will be on the timeline. Drag it to the new scene and then hit "Datamosh." The I-frame removal effect can be shown on the screen. Again, click on (+) to add a new mosh module. Press "Multiply" and then "Average" from the menus that appear. Hit "Average previous 3" afterward.

![i-frame removal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-12.jpg)

### Step 3: Using the Hold Frames Function

Set the in and out points of this mosh marker and again hit "Datamosh." The work area will be rendered. Now, open the mosh module and toggle on the "Hold Frames" feature. Also, toggle on the previous render. Press the "Datamosh" again.

![use hold frames function](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-13.jpg)

### Step 4: Injecting the Frames

Toggle the "Inject Frames" on and press use previous render. Hit "Datamosh" afterward. In this way, the clip will hold the frames and inject them into the transition. Enhance the intensity of the moshing algorithm and eliminate "Remove Frames" and "Inject Frames." Use the previous render and again hit "Datamosh."

![inject frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-14.jpg)

### Step 5: Playing with the Acceleration

Increase the acceleration and bring the intensity back to what it was. Again, use the previous render and click "Datamosh." Now, improve the intensity and set the acceleration back to 0\. Alter the "Blend" as much you need to mix the original and present motion of the transition. Press the "Datamosh."

![play with acceleration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-15.jpg)

### Step 6: Changing the Threshold

Moving on to the threshold feature, this function is a gatekeeper and decides if a pixel will be moshed. Inverse the intensity of the clip, change the blend to be 0, and set the threshold to be a small integer to find out the impact first. It can be enhanced later on. Uncheck the previous render if you are using the new clip for threshold. Hit "Datamosh" again. Now, export the video, and you are done with the datamoshing.

## Part 1: What is the Datamoshing Effect?

Before going into the depths of workability and operation of the datamoshing effect in After Effects, let us understand the effect in detail. The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.

In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.

Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.

## Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?

The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.

Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.

The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.

The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.

The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.

## Part 3: Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)

Understanding the datamosh After Effects is one thing, and incorporating it in your footage is another. The section shall walk you through the step-by-step guide to create the After Effects' datamoshing effect without a plugin. So, let's go, shall we?

### Step 1: Preliminary Process

The first step is easy. Open After Effects from your system. Import the targeted video that needs the datamosh effect. After that, head to the "Content-Aware Fill" to begin the process.

![tap on content aware fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Creating the Reference Frame

Use the playhead where you wish to create the effect, and then click on "Create Reference Frame." The picture frame opens in Photoshop, and the user is expected to save it. Now, go back to the After Effects.

![create reference frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Smearing Process

Now, hide the top layer so that the smearing can occur. Turn the Masks to "None" so that you can perform the masking. Split the second layer to duplicate the layer as we make changes to it. Set the "Masks" to "Subtract and then add a refine soft matte.

![ smearing process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-3.jpg)

### Step 4: Pre-composing the Clip

It is important to pre-compose the clip, so right-click on the timeline and hit "Pre-compose" to the menu list that appears. Tick mark "Move all attributes into the new composition" and rename the clip afterward. Hit "OK."

![pre-compose clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Rendering Queue

Double-click on the timeline, hold shift and drag it until the clip snaps. Press "B" on your keyboard and "N" on the other side to snap the work area. Navigate to "File" and "Export" and then click on "Render Queue."

![render queue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-5.jpg)

### Step 6: Generating Fill Layer

Import the file when it is done rendering and drag it to the timeline. Trim the work area again using B and N buttons from the keyboard. Ensure that the fill method is "Surface," and the range is "Work Area." Click on "Generate Fill Layer" to start the analyzing process.

![generate fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-6.jpg)

### Step 7: Creating the Transition

The user is expected to create a transition between the two shots. Use the track matte to make solid and fractal noise. In the "Noise and Grain" section, click on "Fractal noise" and then switch the fractal type to "Basic." Now, keyframe the "Brightness" and simultaneously turn its level to black and white to create a transition.

![create transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Achieving a Glitchy Effect

To give the glitchy effect, head to the "Effects and Presets" and hit "Posterize," and reduce its level to a couple of integers. Pull the transition down to the fill layer and set it to "Luma Matte." It will showcase the halo sign that we masked around the image.

![create glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Have a Finer Imprint

To eliminate it, use the "Set Matte" channel and alter its layer to the one we pre-composed. Now, invert the matte. Moving on, navigate to the "Simple Choker" and reduce it to one pixel. For perfection, duplicate it and get a finer imprint.

![customize simple choker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-9.jpg)

### Step 10: Final Process

Duplicate the grey solid and then extend the second clip to our fill. In the last step, change the layer of the second clip to "Luma Matte" and save the video. You are done with the process.

![change to luma matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-10.jpg)

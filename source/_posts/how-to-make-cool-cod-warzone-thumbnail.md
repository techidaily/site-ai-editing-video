The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player's character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words "AFK. Don't shoot!" are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It's more "funny" than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.

At the top-right is a large logo of GEFORCE RTX 3080 and at the bottom left is an Intel logo. Like the previous one, it attracts viewers by stating the visual appeal of the video.

## What Is Motion Tracking and How to Use It

Motion tracking makes it easier to follow the movement of objects and provide the sensed data to a program for additional processing. Motion tracking involves recording an object's movements that match a previously stored motion template. This has a wide range of uses, including in robotics, entertainment, sports, the military, and the entertainment industry. Additionally, it is utilized in the creation of video games and films. While motion tracking is frequently referred to as match movement in the film and video game industries, motion tracking is frequently referred to as motion capture in other contexts.

## Part 1\. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking

We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let's quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,

Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion  
Add text or solids as additional compositional elements  
Add 3D elements to 2D footage  
Use effects or color gradation methods  
Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television

These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.

## Part 2\. What software do you need?

There are numerous options for motion tracking applications. With advantages and downsides, we've compiled a list of the finest motion tracking programs. The following are the best video editors for motion tracking in our opinion:

### Filmora

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Blender

Open-source and cost-free motion tracking software is called Blender. It's an excellent 3D creating tool. Modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing, 2D animation, and of course motion tracking is all supported.

![blender video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-video-editing.jpg)

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

![kdenlive adjust slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kdenlive-adjust-slider.jpg)

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

![hitfilm express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hitfilm-express.jpg)

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award. It enables you to accurately attach images and messages and even adjust for shifting perspective. You can hide faces, license information, and any private objects using this capability.

![vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

### Adobe Premiere Pro

Because of its superior editing capabilities, Premiere Pro seems to be a requirement for anyone learning video editing. Premiere Pro, however, has a limited number of presets and automatic tools in order to provide consumers the most control.

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

When masking and blurring a face, motion tracking only works with the auto option. If not, you will need to enter and alter multiple keyframes to add text or resize the video, or you will need to install an extension to convert the mask's tracks to any transformed parts.

### PowerDirector

Due to its simplicity of use, PowerDirector is unquestionably among the greatest motion tracking programs currently available. It accomplishes complex effects without having an advanced learning curve, in contrast to other video editing tools. As demonstrated in the introductory video up top, a simple interface may be used to easily track and manage one or more motion-tracked items.

![powerdirector for mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-mac-5.jpg)

With this program, creating a simple motion track may be done in only three easy steps. This editor is for you if you want to finish the job swiftly and painlessly and are new to intermediate video editing.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.

You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.

You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a **lightroom collage** of pictures, follow the steps given below.

**Create a Photo Collage with a New Template**

For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it's worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.

**Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs**

Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.

**Step 2: Establishing the Workspace**

After importing and editing the photos, it's time to create a workspace. Go to the "Print" panel and then to the "Print Job" menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.

**Step 3: Create a Photo Layout**

As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the "Add to Package" section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.

**Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout**

If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It's pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn't seem pleasing to your eyes.

**Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template**

Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? **Make a collage in Lightroom** using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won't get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.

**Step 1: Import the photos into the program**

Here also, you can't create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on "File" > "Add Photos" and choose the file location.

**Step 2: Download the collage layout**

Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a **photo collage in Lightroom.** You are free to download any one that appeals to you.

**Step 3: Bring in the Template**

Click on the "Print" module > "Template Browser" > "Lightroom Templates" menu. Now, import the extracted **Lightroom collage template** using the "Import" button.

**Step 4: Insert Photos**

After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●**Formatting the pictures is the easy part. The real struggle is in creating the collage. That takes a bit more time, but it's worth it in the end.

**●**You can follow any of the above steps to get your desired photo collage. So now, you can reduce your burden with Adobe Lightroom or Wondershare Filmora .

**●**We hope you followed along with this tutorial and have enjoyed reading it. Thanks for your efforts and time.

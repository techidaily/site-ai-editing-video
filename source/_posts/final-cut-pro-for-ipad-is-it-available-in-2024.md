For macOS 10.12 or later

Step 1: Launch [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline. Now, trim the music to 30 seconds and listen to the end part. Select the last note to match the beat in the beginning part of the music.

![match note with the music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-1.jpg)

Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use "M" from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.

![add markers and adjust video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg)

Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.

![create widescreen cinemascope bar opener](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-3.jpg)

Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.

![match length of whole video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-4.jpg)

![adjust title of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-5.jpg)

Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the "Effects" tab to blur the video clips.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the "Animation" and then "Customize." Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the "Scale" percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!

## Add Green Screen Effects in Final Cut Pro

## Part 3\. Green Screen Video Tips to Use

We have already stated that replacing green screen in your video with an eye-catching background is the easiest part. On the contrary, shooting the green screen video is the most important part. If you shoot the video perfectly, replacing the background accurately in the video editor becomes super easy. Here are some important tips to use while shooting green screen video.

**Distance** – There should be enough distance between the subject and the green screen background so that the subject does not cast a shadow on the green screen. This distance is also important to place lights in between so that the green screen is perfectly lit for a great video shooting session.

**Quality** – You should opt for a high-quality green screen cloth for the background. This means the green screen should have a solid color instead of light and dark patches here and there. Besides, you should ensure that there are no wrinkles on the green screen.

Otherwise, when you will apply green screen effect through the video editor, the transformation will be uneven. You have to spend a lot of time adjusting the parameters to cover up uneven patches in the background.

**Lighting** – The way you set up your lights plays a major role in shooting green screen video perfectly. The light falling on the green screen will light up the screen evenly so that there are no light and dark patches. Transforming the green screen in the video editor will become that much easier.

You should focus on soft and even lighting for the entire green screen, and you should check through your camera to ensure the lighting is perfect. Sometimes, you can place lights behind the subject if the subject is staying stationary throughout the video. Otherwise, you can place the light above the subject for even distribution.

**Aperture** – The settings of your camera are equally important to smoothen out the green screen in the background and focus on the subject sharply. That is where aperture comes into the scene, and you need to use low aperture while shooting green screen videos. Low aperture opens up the camera lens, and the green screen turns softer in the background. The subject stands out while the background turns uniformly green.

**Shutter Speed** – While shooting a green screen video, you should keep a high shutter speed to prevent motion blur and uneven background. If the subject stays fixed throughout, the shutter speed should be double the frame rate. If the subject is moving throughout, the shutter speed should be around 4 times the frame rate such as 1/100.

**ISO** – The last thing you want in a green screen video is grainy footage. Your life will turn upside down editing the video and getting the green screen effect perfectly in any video editor. ISO determines the sensitivity and thereby, the grainy effect in your video. When the ISO is too high, the chance of getting grains in the video is high. It is better to use a native ISO for green screen effect, but you need to check with a sample recording and adjust if required.

## Conclusion

We have answered how to add background to green screen Final Cut Pro. You can replace any green screen in your video with any video or photo for the background of the video. If you do not have Final Cut Pro or you find the steps slightly complicated, we recommend you to use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for instant green screen effect and quick adjustments for the best outcome.

## Turn Your Text Into a Podcast Made Possible

Being a content creator, either writing or generating videos, requires podcast text-to-speech knowledge. The impact of content depends on how many people see it. It means finding new ways to get it into real and virtual places where customers and users might be.

Depending on the context, podcasting can be a perfect alternative for sharing content.

This article will address your questions about the easiest way to turn a blog into a podcast. Let's begin with the reasons why you should do a podcast.

## Part 1\. Why You Should Podcast

Podcasts are one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways. It helps to advertise yourself and your products to a highly targeted audience. Podcasts are also excellent for engaging with potential clients interested in your content. In your field, you can achieve fame and expertise.

![effective podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-text-to-speech-1.jpg)

### Repurposing of Content

Podcasters can maximize their potential for successful episodes and repurposing their podcast into multiple content pieces.

This podcasting strategy can help you reach more people by putting your podcasts on more channels and engaging more people who might be interested.

### More Fulfilling than Articles

Unlike music, news, TV, and social media, podcast listeners don't have to watch the screen like they do with YouTube videos or TV shows. This means they can listen while walking or driving home from work.

Podcasts are the best way to get people to pay attention and make fundamental societal changes. They can keep people interested for a long time, so you can go into detail and get personal without turning off your audience.

### Minimal Start-Up Costs

To start a podcast, you can spend a little money. Even some of the most famous podcasts use a microphone, a computer, and software for recording. But it's common to spend more money on advertising and better hosting.

Starting a podcast doesn't cost much, as you can get everything you need for about $145.

### Expansion of Search Potential

In the past few years, many big brands and small to medium-sized businesses have started using podcasts as a marketing strategy. This is because podcasts are becoming more and more popular and can help raise your company's profile.

Podcasting is another way to disseminate your study to a broader audience, whether that audience consists of policymakers or interested citizens.

### Potential to Monetize

Using an affiliate program podcast, you can earn money. Businesses can increase their income by offering paid advertising sponsorships to monetize podcasts. Suppose you accept an affiliate offer to sell ads. In that case, you become the company's voice and put recorded ads in your podcast episodes.

The most common way to make money from a podcast is through sponsorship. It's also the easiest way to make money because you don't have to make or sell anything. You just have to make a deal with a sponsor.

## Part 2\. Why Are Writers Hesitant to Start a Podcast?

Even after knowing all these benefits, writers are still hesitant to start a podcast. One of the main reasons a writer may be reluctant to launch a podcast is the cost of the necessary equipment. You will need at least $80 to $500 for this unpromissing business.

However, let me tell you a secret that many podcastors didn't buy any audio equipment for the launch of their podcast channel on Spotify.

Moreover, many writers don’t want to show their voice through recordings. This is because they couldn’t just make a recording and hand it off to a sound specialist. Besides, finding their voice through the stories they write is the routine.

But we all need to get the truth that many podcastors don't record a single word of the podcast with their own voice. Due to a solution: text-to-speech, technology like this has been around for a while and continues to improve.

The two important issues have been solved, so what are you waiting for? Platform building has always relied heavily on content marketing. With blog posts and social media, additional support was provided, and now podcasts are becoming more commonplace.

## Part 3\. How to Turn a Text Into a Podcast?

### Text To Speech

To turn your text into audible content, Text-to-speech (TTS) is an assistive technology. With a single click, TTS reads your written text aloud. Many people also use it for writing and editing to maintain audience concentration.

Text-to-speech technology is compatible with all digital devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. Increasing numbers of websites and products now have developed this function. For example, you can find it within the trusted video editing software like Filmora. With [Filmora's Text to Speech (TTS) feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you may add extra aspects to your video by turning your text files into voiceovers.

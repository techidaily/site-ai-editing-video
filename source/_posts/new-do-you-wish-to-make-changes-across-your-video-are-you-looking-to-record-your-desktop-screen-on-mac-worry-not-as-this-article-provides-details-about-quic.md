#### Method 1: Using Uniform Speed

Using this method, you can slow down your video smartly with the help of AI. Some options in uniform speed will help you to automate the process while ensuring the quality of the content. Look at the steps below to add slo-mo to your video like a pro:

##### Step 1Import Media to the Timeline and Explore Uniform Speed

Install Filmora 13 on your device and open it to access “New Project” from the main interface. When you enter the editing window, import your file into the media panel.

##### Step 2Adjust the Speed and Other Use Advanced Options

Later, drag that file to the timeline and right-click on it to get a list. Select the “Uniform Speed” option from that list and head to the editing panel opened to the right. Under the “Speed,” there will be a slider. You have to move it to the left for slow-motion video. While adjusting speed with that slider, track video duration from the “Duration” section. Below that option, you can toggle the “Reverse Speed” option if required.

![choose uniform speed from drop down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/making-slow-motion-videos-premiere-pro-8.jpg)

Otherwise, check the “Ripple Edit” and “Maintain Pitch” option for good. Now, extend the “AI Interpolation” menu and choose “Optical Flow.” It will let AI automatically adjust the video speed in slow motion with high quality.

#### Method 2: Using Speed Ramping

If you want to bring a professional look to Slow-motion videos, use Speed Ramping. It will ensure a smooth change in video speed when it increases or decreases. To add this refined touch to videos, look at the given steps:

##### Step 1Access the Speed Ramping Option in 2 Ways

Tap the “Speed Ramping” next to the “Uniform Speed” in the right-side panel. Optionally, you can right-click on your videos in the timeline. There, you will find the “Speed Ramping” option below the “Uniform Speed” option in the list.

##### Step 2Speed Ramping Your Videos and Get Render Preview

In the Speed Ramping Section, you will get 6 templates. Pick one or hit the “Customize” to design your own speed ramping in videos. Later, move to the toolbar of the timeline section and choose “Render Preview” next to the “Copilot” icon. It will bring a smooth playback of your speed ramping in videos.

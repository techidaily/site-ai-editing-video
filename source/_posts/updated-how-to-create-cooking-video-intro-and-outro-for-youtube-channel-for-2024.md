02 [What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?](#Part 2)

03 [10 Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?**

Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.

The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.

**Technology Behind Augmented Reality**

As far as the technology behind the development of **augmented reality video** is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.

The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.

## Part 2 **What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?**

Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments.

Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.

**●** User Control

Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.

The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.

The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.

## Part 2 **What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?**

Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.

Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:

**●** **Underlying Concept**

Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.

**●** **Existence Constraints**

Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.

## Part 1 **What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?**

Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.

The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.

**Technology Behind Augmented Reality**

As far as the technology behind the development of **augmented reality video** is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images.

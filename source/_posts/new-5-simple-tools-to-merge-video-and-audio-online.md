### **Numerous Video Effects**

Importing media and editing it on the timeline to create a compelling tale is the first step in a video editor's post-production process. Following those foundational steps, an editor applies various effects to the video in order to fix issues, improve mood, intensify suspense, and add magic to the video. Filmora offers a great variety of customizable filters, effects, transitions and the best part? You don’t even have to be a pro to use these effects.

### **Title Editing**

Filmora enables the intro video makers to adorn the titles of their videos by selecting among multiple text editing options. Both short videos and full-length movies must have opening titles and closing credits. You may catch the audience's attention from the first frame of your video by coming up with inventive methods to employ text which precisely conveys the tale of your film. You may utilize more than a hundred text settings in Filmora's Titles tab to add text to the video.

### **Text to Speech/STT**

Speaking in your videos may increase engagement and make it simpler for viewers to grasp what you're saying. But how can you add audio without first recording it? Are you considering hiring a voice actor? Don’t worry! Filmora got your back by offering Text to Speech (TTS) function, which enables the users to add voice to your video. Filmora automatically transcripts your text files into speech on the click of a button.

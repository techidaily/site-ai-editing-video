## Detailed Tutorial to Crop Video in KineMaster

“Create. Edit. Share. Transform your videos with KineMaster! Powerful tools, easy to use.” – a few words we read when we come up with the official web-site of KineMaster, a mobile video editing application.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-1.jpeg)

Scrolling down, we see a rich list of all the features KineMaster offers to its users, such as: Assets, Projects, Backup and Share, Blending Modes, Reverse, Chroma Key, High Resolution, Video Layers. Simply put, on KineMaster, you can download projects, add more than 2 500 effects, use powerful tools, add cinematic color, etc…

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-2.jpeg)

This many features make you think – how come it is possible to do all that on a mobile phone? How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?

Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.

So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-3.jpeg)

The interesting fact you will notice is that the layout of the app is horizontal, not vertical, unlike in most cases. So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.

It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-4.jpeg)

This will take you to the editor. Even though in the media section you will find the video you want to work on, but you might be struggling to notice a Crop button. It is because unfortunately, it’s not possible to crop your video right away in KineMaster – first, you will need to add a background, for example, a black one.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-5.jpeg)

Then, you will go back to the menu and find Media section again to add the video clip you want to crop.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-6.jpeg)

After adding it to the editor, you need to tap on the video file which has appeared in the sequence – this will show you different features you can use on the right. You have to scroll down a little and Voila! – here you find Cropping. After having clicked on that, a little cropping window will appear on the screen.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-7.jpeg)

You can resize the clip, and in order to crop the video, turning on the mask option is needed.

**Install the application**

First of all, you need to install the **slideshow maker no watermark** that you want. Pick a slideshow maker of your choice as per the features you need to work with. After choosing the slideshow maker, install it from internet and allow your device to run the application.

**Upload your files**

Upload your photos and arrange them in the order you want. In most of the slideshow makers, you will get the option of sliding pictures and rearranging them. You can also insert text on pictures after this step.

**Apply effects, filters and transitions**

Your basic slideshow is ready. Now apply effects, filters and transitions to make your slideshow beautiful. The theme itself comes with the effects sometimes; for example; if you choose holiday theme, romance or party, the theme will come with effects and filters accordingly. But you can customize it as per your choice and apply filters and effects according to your preference. Then check transition library and apply the one that attract you. You can also use different transitions for different set of pictures.

The procedure of removing watermark depends totally upon the slideshow maker you choose.

## How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

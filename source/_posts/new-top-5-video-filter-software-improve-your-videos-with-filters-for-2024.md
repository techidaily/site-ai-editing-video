Once in the timeline, your video is ready to go into editing mode. But before we insert the template of our intro, we need another step as shown!

##### Step3 Trim The Video Clips

As it's the intro, we need to trim the video clips, so they are concise. You may have recorded longer video clips, but we need clips that are no longer than **5 seconds**.

To trim the video clips, follow the steps mentioned:

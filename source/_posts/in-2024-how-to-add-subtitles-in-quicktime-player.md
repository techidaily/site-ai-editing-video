## How to Add Subtitles in QuickTime Player?

QuickTime is among the most popular multimedia players available for PC users. Developed by Apple Inc. in 1991, it was initially made available for Mac OS. However, from 2005 till 2016, QuickTime was available for Windows operating systems as well. While QuickTime allows you to view images and music, it is a popular choice for playing videos.

Do you use QuickTime player to watch music videos, movies, and TV shows? Well, you may find it interesting that the QuickTime player allows you to add subtitles. As there are multiple methods through which you can add subtitles in QuickTime, we are going to discuss them one by one in this blog. So, let’s start our discussion!

## Method 1: Turn on the Subtitles in QuickTime

As you might know, some videos come with embedded subtitles. It’s up to you whether you want to view them while playing the video or not. If you are playing a video with embedded subtitles in the QuickTime player but are somehow unable to view the subtitles, it’s probably because the subtitles feature is turned off. So, you need to enable the subtitles by following certain steps.

### Steps to Turn on Subtitles in QuickTime

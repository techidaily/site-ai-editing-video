First off, we start in the same way – download and install Wondershare Filmora X. Oh – maybe, that is the step you have already taken?..

Click on Import Media Files Here, which will let you add the file(s) you are going to crop.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-12.jpeg)

You will choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-13.jpeg)

Above your video in the sequence you will see little icons and find a Crop one.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-14.jpeg)

After clicking on it, a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-15.jpeg)

After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video where you want it to be accessible later.

Another part of this article was Wondershare Filmora X and how to crop a video there, also, with a detailed guide there. We hope you know a little more about programs, editing, and your own choice!

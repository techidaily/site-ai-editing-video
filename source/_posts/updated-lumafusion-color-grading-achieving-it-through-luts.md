## Shoot Video with Virtual Green Screen

We have seen video creators on YouTube using green screen effects to beautify their background to make the video look professional and eye-catching. The same is applicable for gamers who live stream their gameplay on Twitch. Instead of physically hanging green screens in the background, some video creators opt for virtual green screens. Yes, it is possible to shoot videos with a virtual green background, and you do not have to buy screen greens and deal with the problem of hanging them in the background.

The concept of using virtual greenscreen is rather new, but it is getting popular among amateur video creators who do not want to invest in purchasing green screens initially. When you use a virtual background to shoot your video, the actual physical background is replaced completely with a virtual green background. Thereafter, you have to replace this virtual background with anything by using a video editor. In this article, we will illustrate how to use a virtual green screen to shoot video.

## 1\. Free Virtual Green Screen

In order to shoot a video with green virtual background, you cannot shoot your video with your regular camera app. Otherwise, your physical background will get recorded, and replacing that through video editor is going to be time-consuming. Therefore, there are specific apps available through which you have to shoot your video so that your physical background gets completely replaced by virtual greenscreen in real-time.

Snap Camera from Snapchat is a free app through which you can shoot your video to get a virtual green background. The app comes with a Green Screen filter that makes this virtual background effect possible. However, you will need a camera recording app that can record your video with green screen effects from Snap Camera. We will be using OBS Studio for recording the video which is also available for free. Snap Camera is compatible with Windows 10 and Mac 10.11+, and hence, you can use it to shoot video from your computer webcam. Here are the steps to follow –

Step 1: Download and install [Snap Camera app](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) on your computer.

Step 2: Set up your webcam perfectly so that its angle is direct to your face.

Step 3: Open Snap Camera app and you will see yourself on the app through your webcam. Select the appropriate Lens(filter) and you have to select Green Screen Snap Filter.

![free virtual green screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-virtual-green-screen.jpg)

Step 4: You should see a green virtual background by now. Now, you have to launch OBS Studio (webcam recording software).

Step 5: Go to Sources and click on “+” icon and select Video Capture Device option.

![video capture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-capture.jpg)

Step 6: While configuration the new device, select Snap Camera as Device. This will enable green screen virtual backgrounds and you can start recording. After recording is done, save the file on your hard drive.

![save the file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-the-file.jpg)

Now that you have recorded the video with green virtual background without green screen, it is time to edit the virtual greenscreen out with the video editor.

## 2\. Best Way To Apply Green Screen Effect To Your Recorded Video

The best video editor to add green effect to your recorded video with virtual green screen is Wondershare Filmora. There are loads of video editors available with green screen feature but Filmora has the simplest steps to add green screen effects. That is why you do not have to be an expert video editor to add green screen effects to your video.

## How To Change Speed of Video in Final Cut Pro?

When there are certain boring but necessary parts in your video, you need to speed them up. Similarly, you may need to reduce the duration of the entire video. Speeding up the video is your only option when you do not want to cut any part. You must have also observed that certain videos look funny when you speed them up. To speed up videos, you will need a video editor that does not degrade the video quality.

Final Cut Pro is a popular choice to speed up video without distorting the pitch. Many think that the video quality can degrade when they change the speed of the video clip. This concern can be taken care of when you alter the video speed with Final Cut Pro. Instead of changing the speed of the entire video, you can change the speed of specific parts. We will illustrate how to speed up the video using Final Cut Pro and suggest a better choice than FCP.

## Part I. Speed Up Video using Final Cut Pro

## Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro

You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.

**Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -**

By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video's speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.

**Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -**

You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project's frame rate.

You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.

![speed up automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

**Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -**

Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.

The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.

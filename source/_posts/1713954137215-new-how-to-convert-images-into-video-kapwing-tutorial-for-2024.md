## Easy Steps to Create Intro Video with After Effects

![create intro video after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-intro-video-after-effects.jpg)

It's difficult to make an intro in After Effects. To start, you must have a natural beginning that will catch the

viewer's attention in the film you've made right away. Then, you can improve the caliber of your intros by using built-in filters, transition effects, overlays, animation, and more! Therefore, we're confident that this article will be helpful to you if you've been trying to learn how to create After Effects intros of the highest level. Continue reading to learn more.

Let's start off!

## 1\. Create a new composition for your intro

You must build up your video's composition based on the output. You can upload the previously recorded video after choosing the composition and the runtime. Right-click again and select "Pre-compose" from the menu that appears. To make it simpler to find later, you can also rename your movie here.

The composition can then include a solid layer. Follow \*Layer > New > Solid\* to get to this option. Additionally,

you can choose a hue based on the type of video you want to make. Additionally, you may use the Text option to build text layers, which will allow you to split the words at different points in the document. You can edit each word separately when you break it into layers. Finally, you can move the text around and change the color of the reader to make it more appropriate for your films.

After Effects makes it incredibly simple to edit the text composition and import it into the timeline of the film.

A panel appears on the right after importing a text composition. Here, you can alter the text's color, position,

and size.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Add the first transition layer

By include the transition layer, you may use After Effects' effects templates to apply a variety of effects to your

videos. You can experiment with a variety of transition layers in After Effects before selecting the ideal one (CC Light Wipe is a popular choice).

You can modify the transition after applying it to the layer. For instance, you may decide to apply the second

key transition at a later period in the timeline and configure the first key transition to occur immediately at the start of the timeline. Setting the completion value is crucial since it will influence how long the word will remain displayed in the video.

## 3\. Add the second transition layer

The transition effect you introduced in the first stage can either be maintained here, or you can select an

entirely different one. According to how long you want the text to be displayed, add the layer and adjust

completion. The reader is invisible when the completion value is set to 100%, or the word is said when it is set

to 0%.

**A memory sketch**

If you want to make a black-and-white video that is more interesting, the memory sketch is a great template to use. You can make a visually beautiful video with its outstanding text captions, fluid transitions, and excellent animations.

**Toolkit for Instagram**

These days, Instagram is a very popular social media site. Instagram is a platform where reels and videos

flourish, therefore you must make every effort to differentiate your video from the millions of others available.

The Instagram Toolkit template meets the standards of the social media network by being brief, clear, and

appealing.

**Lighting sweep**

A final transition effect, which can be found in the \*Effects > Generate \*section, must be added to the video in order to complete the effect. The final flourish can be added in the same way as the other keyframes. In this step, you can use the edge intensity, sweep intensity, and direction. This allows you to seamlessly combine the transition of words with lighting effects.

These are some quick and easy techniques to adding some intros to your videos that look professional. Let's

also take a look at some well-known templates you may utilize to make perfect video intros. Because the initial few seconds of any video are so important, After Effects has put together some incredible templates that have a variety of video clips, images, text, sound effects, and music tracks. To produce the video you want, you must obtain the ideal template.

* I chose the second one since we’re not going on live at this very moment. As you can see in the image below. There you have options to choose from. Whether to use the built-in webcam of your laptop or the computer you’re using or you can use a personal computer screen recorder like OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software). I already break down the whereabouts of this particular screen recorder on my previous article. But, let me just discuss you a little bit, maybe it’ll be helpful if you want to go on live with a more powerful and engaging live streaming.

![enable camera and microphone youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-camera-and-microphone-youtube.jpg)

* You just need to simplify what is your live stream all about. Make a catchy title so that your audiences will be curious and will wait for you to be on live. Be specific with your description and find a topic that will be helpful to others. You know, everyone’s time is gold. We need to make the most out of it.

![adjust stream settings youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjust-stream-settings-youtube.jpg)

* I changed the Title and the Description as an example and the thumbnail as well. You can edit it when you continue to scroll down. You'll choose what kind of category it fits in. If you want, you can also add it to your Playlist and you’ll choose your audience, if it’s suitable for kids or not.

![create stream details](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-details.jpg)

* And since my YouTube Channel was already monetized, I have the options to monetize the live streaming too.

![create stream monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-monetization.jpg)

* As what it says, you need to customize the live stream according to your preference.

![create stream customization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-customization.jpg)

* And the final step before you can actually go on live, you will choose the visibility of your live broadcast. Usually, most of the people choose **_Public_** located at the bottom area of the options listed in the image below.

![create stream visibility](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-visibility.jpg)

![record youtube live stream](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/record-youtube-live-stream.jpg)

During the live streaming, you can see people interacting with you on live and that’s totally awesome!

**Live streaming is essential for your YouTube Channel success for two main reasons:**

1. You can minimize the part of editing a raw vlog and that is time consuming, you can just click the “Go Live” button and follow all the required steps and you can share all your ideas through everyone who will watch your live streaming. You can exchange thoughts, interact with them right away. You can also enhance your speaking skills in front of the camera. A very much needed ability if you want to be a YouTuber like us.
2. If you’re a newbie in vlogging, YouTube set its requirements for you to be their YouTube Partner; which includes 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours (240,000 minutes). So, if you want to get pass above it as fast as you could, YouTube livestreaming could be the best key to achieve it. Imagine you're going to be on live for about 3 hours in a row, so that’s 180 minutes already.

To sum it up, if you’re someone who wants to share your ability to the virtual world out there; then YouTube platform can be one of your go-to-stage. You can also choose Facebook if you want to target large audiences. Although YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, I think Facebook are a way ahead when it comes to reaching potential viewers or audiences because Facebook statistics show that more than two billion users have an account, 65 million businesses have Facebook pages and advertisers are crazy about it. Most of our friends and relatives are on Facebook. And that’s freaking insane. So, what are you waiting for, choose your social platform and GO ON LIVE!

## Ultimate Guide on How to Film Better in Public

Filming in public and different locations can add a new dimension to any video. The possibilities are limitless, from the hustle and bustle of a busy city street to the tranquil beauty of a remote beach.

Suppose you're a new vlogger and want to capture the perfect scene in public. Then this blog is for you. It will explain various tips and tricks to help you create the best videos, regardless of location. So let's start and learn more about how to film better in public!

## Part 1\. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?

While recording in public, you want to avoid setting and holding unnecessary camera gear. That's why you should keep your gear as low-key as possible. The essential shooting gears that you are going to need are as follows:

### A Good Camera

A good camera is essential to record a video in public because it will provide quality footage. It will also allow you to capture more detail and create more engaging videos. But if you use a phone instead, make sure it is the latest iPhone or other with high pixels camera.

![a dslr camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### A Tripod

A tripod is essential when recording video in public to ensure that your shots are stable and steady. Without a tripod, your camera can shake and create a distorted, blurry image that can ruin a shot. So having a secure tripod will help you capture professional-looking footage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-2.jpg)

### A Microphone

A microphone is essential for recording a video in public because it captures the sound in the environment, allowing the video to be recorded with better-quality audio. Without a microphone, the video would be recorded with distorted sound and would likely be challenging to understand.

![a vlogging microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-3.jpg)

Apart from the gear mentioned above, you can also bring an ND filter, extra batteries, and SD cards. Because If the battery runs out or the SD card becomes full, the video recording could be lost. The spare batteries and SD cards help to ensure that the video can be captured uninterrupted. Let's see what we need further.

## Part 2\. What Do You Need to Accomplish With Your Video?

While recording a video in a busy location, you need to accomplish three things with your video to record it better. Which are as follows:

<a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B300x600%2B"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-300x600.gif" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Clean Shots

When recording in a busy location, it is essential to try and capture clean shots. It can be done by using a wide-angle lens to get the full shot or zooming in to focus on a particular element.

### 2\. Clean Audio

Getting a clean and clear sound when recording audio in a busy location is essential. A good quality microphone, an audio recorder, or external noise reduction can help minimize background noise and capture the desired audio.

### 3\. Decent Lighting

In a busy location, decent lighting is as important as the other two factors. Look for natural light sources that can provide good light, even illumination. If these are unavailable, consider using portable lighting equipment or lamps to create a more flattering environment.

Now that we know what we need let's see how to make a video.

## Part 3\. How to Get the Best Shot While Filming Outdoor?

Whether you are a vlogger, a YouTuber, or a student filmmaker, shooting a video in a busy area is always a challenge. You must be able to plan and execute your production in a way that minimizes disruption and produces quality footage. By following these instructions, we hope you can make a difference in a shot you record:

##### Step1 Scout the Location

Before recording, visit the location in advance to plan your shots. Take note of potential distractions or noise sources and plan your angles accordingly.

![scouting the location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-4.png)

##### Step2 Choose the correct shooting time

The best time to record a video in a busy location is when the area is less crowded, such as early in the morning or late at night. Avoiding peak times and holidays is also a good idea.

##### Step3 Choose the right angle

Once you get to the location, you must find the right angle.

**Select Background**

Try to find a background that will best capture the atmosphere of the area and minimize any background noise.

![select the background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-5.png)

**Set the frame**

If your frame is too broad, you will face potential distractions that could interfere with your video, such as people walking in and out of the frame.

![setting the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-6.png)

**Set your position**

Instead of getting closer to your talent, get further away and zoom in this way, you leave space for other people in the location, and you can still get your shot!

![zoom in the talent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-7.png)

Try to get your shot and then get out quickly so you don't bother other people trying to get their photos.

## Part 4\. Best Way to Record Audio While Filming Outdoor

Audio is essential to any video production, and recording audio while filming outdoor scenes can be challenging.

Outdoor environments come with more variables to consider, such as wind, traffic noise, and other background noise, that can make capturing clear audio more difficult. Even if you use a high-quality mic, you still have chances of interruption.

If you get any such variable in the video you recorded, you can re-record the audio with the help of **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Let's see how you can do it:

Step1 First, select the clip you want to re-record and then drag it onto the timeline.

Step2 Right-click on the video you dragged and then click on the **Detach Audio**. After doing that, mute the lousy audio from the audio timeline.

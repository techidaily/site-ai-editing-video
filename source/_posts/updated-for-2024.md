![drag title in timeline filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/title.png)

Step 3

Double-click on it and change the font to anything you like. Then, enter the text in the box in front of you. While you’re here, you can also edit the text spacing and other features.

![edit title in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text.png)

Step 4

Now, take a snapshot of the text. Then, double-click on the default title again and change the text to a single letter I. Once again, take a snapshot of this text and then delete the default title from the timeline.

![take snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png)

You should have two snapshots in **My Media** now. One of them should say “FILMORA” and one with the letter “I”.

![media center in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/my-media.png)

Step 5

## How to Use LUTs in VN Editor – Complete Guide and Best LUTs Download

Hello and welcome to another article full of information and excitement. The topic of this article is **LUT for the VN editor**. So it will be exciting for those who want to use LUTs in their video to make them look nice and well. As we will discuss today that what is VN editor and how you can add LUTs to your videos using it on the devices it is compatible for. Moreover, where you can **download some fantastic LUTs** like **moody LUTs,** which help your videos to look nice, and which software you should use for this purpose if you are running a device on which the VN editor is not compatible. So let's begin!

## Part 1\. What is VN editor?

VN editor is one of the best choices for video editing on mobiles and Mac. Fast editing, transitions, effects, filters, colors, subtitles, music, and many other features make the VN video editing app a great tool for producing and editing videos.

![luts fo vn editor completed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-1.jpg)

## Part 2\. How to use LUTs in VN editor?

First, we must know that it is compatible with which platforms. So, it is now available for Android, iOS, and Mac OS only. However, you can also use it on Windows with some Android or iOS emulators, but it is not a very continent way in our suggestions. Even after doing this, it does not work well on your Windows. Maybe you will face some glitches or malfunctioning problems. So it is better to use it on only those platforms for which it is primarily available. Please read the instructions below since we will go through how to use LUTs in it later on.

**On Mac:**

First of all, we will learn how you can do it on Mac:

1. Download the VN Editor for Mac and open it.
2. Add your video and then tap the filters option.

![tap the filters option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-2.jpg)

1. Now choose custom filters and then select the LUTs pack.

**On Mobile:**

Secondly, we will discuss how we can do this on our mobiles (Android or iOS). The procedure on both devices (Android or iOS) is almost comparable. Therefore, we will discuss the steps from the perspective of both of these here:

1. First, download the VN editor from your mobile app store (Android or iOS) and the LUTs pack you want to use in your video.

![download the vn editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-5.jpg)

2. Create a new project and add your video to it.

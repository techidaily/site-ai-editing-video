## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

S-Log is a gamma curve optimized for digital cameras to maximize the image sensor's performance. Although these videos may look flat and washed out, they contain lots of color information. Even better, video creators can use color correction to edit the S-Log videos and make them look as natural as possible. That's what this article is all about.

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

This tutorial assumes that you already have an S-Log footage. If not, you can record S-Log footage using most Canon, Sony, and Panasonic cameras.

![how to color-correct an s-log footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/record-s-log-footage.gif)

Let's get to the steps!

##### Step1 Adjust the color settings

Start by adding your video to the timeline on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then double-click the video track. Then, click on the **Color** tab before tapping **Advanced**.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![adjust the color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-1.jpg)

##### Step2 Read and study the histogram

Now you'll see the Advanced Color Correction pop-up window. Here, you'll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.

![read and study the histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Adjust the image colors

Once you've understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.

![adjust the image colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif)

After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the **Light** section, then adjust the **Highlights** to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn't look pure white, increase the **Whites** slide to make it whiter.

![go to the light section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg)

Now adjust the **Shadows** settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the **Blacks** slider to the left.

**Pro tip**: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don't cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.

##### Step4 Adjust the color saturation

Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the **Color** section and adjust the **Saturation** slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the **Vibrance** to make your video objects look more colorful.

![adjust the color saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg)

##### Step5 Preview and compare the video

Now it's time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the **Eye** icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the **AB** icon and choose **Split View-Left/Right** to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.

![preview and compare the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-5.jpg)

## Summary

I guess that was easy, right? Up to this juncture, you should be able to perform basic color correction on your video using Wondershare Filmora. Remember, this video editor packs many other editing tools to bring out your creativity. Give it a try!

#### In this article

01 [How to Use Distortion Effect in Premiere Pro?](#part1)

02 [Bonus! Free Distortion Effects for Premiere Pro](#part2)

Adobe Premiere Pro offers a wide variety of beneficial editing tools and effects. Below are some of the impressive distortion effects you'll find in Premiere Pro and how to use them in your project.

#### 1\. Corner Pin Effect

This effect distorts your image by simply changing the position of its corners. You can use the Corner pin effect to twist, skew, shrink, or stretch an image. Additionally, you can use it to simulate movement or perspective pivoting from the edge of your clip like a door opening.

You can directly manipulate the properties of the Corner Pin effect in the Program monitor by clicking the Transform right next to Corner Pin. To adjust the properties, drag one of the corner handles.

1. To use this effect, open Premiere Pro and click File. Choose Import from the drop-down menu. The File Explorer window will open and allow you to find your footage. Select the video file you want to import, then click Open.
2. Go to Effects Control and click Distortion. Choose Corner Pin Effect from the drop-down menu.

![use corner pin effect in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-1.png)

1. You can now pin each corner from its original point to another specific point by adjusting the slider on the Upper Left, Upper Right, Lower Left, and Lower Right. You can also highlight your selection tool when working with the Corner Pin effect.

![use corner pin effect in premiere pro - pin corner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-2.png)

#### 2\. Lens Distortion Effect

This distortion effect Premiere Pro simulates the distorted lens through which people view the clip.

1\. Go to Effects Control>Distortion>Lens Distortion Effect.

2\. Choose the settings you want to use from the available options and adjust the slider.

* The Vertical and Horizontal Decentering control displaces the lens' focal and makes the image bend and smear. The image will wrap in on itself at extreme settings.
* The Curvature setting alters the curvature of the lens. You can specify a positive value to make the image convex, while the negative value makes the image concave.
* The Vertical and Horizontal Prism FX setting created results similar to horizontal decentering and vertical, but the image does not wrap in on itself at extreme values.
* Use the Fill Color option to specify the background color, and Fill Alpha to make your background transparent.

![lens distortion effect in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-3.png)

#### 3\. Magnify Effect

This effect allows you to enlarge a selected area of your clip. The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.

1\. To use this effect, go to Effect Control>Distortion>Magnify.

2\. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.

* Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.
* Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.
* Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.
* Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size & Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.
* Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.
* Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that's behind it.
* Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.
* Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.
* Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.
* Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip's edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.

![magnify effect in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-4.png)

#### 4\. Mirror Effect

This distortion Premiere Pro effect splits an image along a line while reflecting one side onto the other. Where the reflection appears and which side will be reflected is determined by the reflection angles.

1\. Head over to Effect Control>Distortion>Mirror to use this effect.

2\. Adjust the controls until you get the results you desire.

* Reflection Angle: With the Reflection Angle control, you can specify the angle of reflection and where it appears on the clip. A zero-degree angle reflects the left-hand side on the right.
* Reflection Center: This control allows you to specify the position of the line. You need to click the box, then drag the resulting crosshair up to the area in the image where you would like to place the line.

![mirror effect in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-5.png)

## Twitch Green Screen Guide

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

**Pro tip**:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### XBOX

It is a video gaming brand created and owned by Microsoft. The brand consists of five video game consoles, as well as applications(games), streaming services, an online service by the name of Xbox network, and the development arm by the name of Xbox Game Studios. The brand was first introduced in the United States in November 2001, with the launch of the original Xbox console.

**Steps on Using Xbox Green Screen**

Make your Xbox console reflect your personal style by changing its look and feel. Choose a favourite colour, update your background with game art or a customised image, or select a different theme.

**Choose your color**

The color you choose will appear in tiles and accents on your Xbox. It also follows you to any console you sign in to.

1. Press the Xboxbutton  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalisation > My color & theme > My color.
2. Select a color, and then select OK.

****Choose your background**

Your background appears where you’d expect it to—in the background of Home. It can be a solid color or an image, such as game art, achievement art, a screenshot, or a customized image. Achievement art follows you to any Xbox, but screenshots and customized images stay on the console that they’re set to.

To choose your background, press the Xbox button  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background.

From here, choose from the following options:

****Solid color and game art**

Select a background color, and then select OK. To then add game art, choose the game most recently played and the game art will appear as the background.

****Achievement art**

1. Select Achievement art> Gaming.
2. Select a game from your list of games with achievements.
3. Select the achievement with the background art you want.
4. Select Set as background.

****Custom image**

Note Customized images must be smaller than 3 MB, and the best size for backgrounds is 1920 x 1080.

1. Copy a JPG or PNG file that you want to use to a USB device, and then plug it into your Xbox.
2. On your Xbox, select Customized image. A dialogue box appears that shows the contents of your console and attached USB device.
3. Select the USB device, and then choose your image.

****Screenshot**

1. Select Screenshot, then choose the one you want.
2. Select More actions> Set as background.

****Dynamic background**

Note Dynamic backgrounds are only available on Xbox Series X|S.

1. Select Dynamic background.
2. Select the background art you want.
3. Select Apply.

Note Some dynamic backgrounds are only available through promotions with special edition hardware (like the 20th Anniversary Special Edition controller). To see one of these special dynamic backgrounds in your list of options, make sure your special edition hardware is turned on and in use with your console when you set your background.

****Remove customized background**

If you want to remove your background, select Remove customized background.

****Choose your theme**

Themes can be set to dark or light and can also be scheduled. To set a theme:

1. Press the Xboxbutton  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization.
2. Select My color & theme.
3. Under System theme, select Darkor Light. Select Scheduled to activate your theme according to specific times, or to start at sunrise and sunset.

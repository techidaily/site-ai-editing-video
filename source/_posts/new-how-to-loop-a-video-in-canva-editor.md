If you're using a [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro, it is likely that you have seen the generic technique of looping a video is by splitting it in two and pasting it together again. What if you need to put on repeat just one individual cut? This is where [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) steps in! It is a handy tool for trimming and adding clips into your recordings.

The Filmora software can be used to quickly create continual sequences of any duration, irrespective of how long the footage is. It makes possible to synchronize sound and video clips, splice them into one another, and even add titles and motion graphics for a special effect. If you utilize Filmora, you do not need to be an expert in video editing to make professional-looking results. Let us explore why Filmora is necessary for video editing.

Filmora is a video editing software that allows you to make professional-looking videos from your footage.

The loop feature in Filmora software is a great way to put your video editing skills to the test.

## Practical Ways to Resize Video in Handbrake

Videos are a great medium to share thoughts, concepts, guides, and memories, but regardless of how far technology has come getting them online can pose an issue sometimes. These obstacles often tend to be because either a video clip is too long or the amount of data in it is so high that the service just cannot upload the file to its servers and make it available for the intended receiver.

To solve this issue, users often need to resize a video so that the data cap, which behaved as a restriction, is no longer applicable. Now, there exist multiple software that can do this, and most video editor programs include the ability to export videos in less data-hungry sizes or formats.

So, if you ever face a similar issue, here is a guide on how you can resize videos via Handbrake and Wondershare Filmora. The former is a lightweight tool perfect for batch resizing videos, while the latter is a powerful free video editing software.

## How to resize video with Handbrake

Open Handbrake and follow the steps listed below.

Once open, the software will present you with options to either import a single video file for resize or a whole batch via folder selection.

**_Note:_** _If you do not have Handbrake, you can_ [_download it by visiting the official website_](https://handbrake.fr/)_. Also, you will need_ [_Windows .NET Framework 6.0_](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime?utm%5Fsource=getdotnetcore&utm%5Fmedium=referral) _to use Handbrake._ _If your system does not have the correct config Handbrake will let you know and fail to launch._

Once you have imported the video file, the software will present you with two choices.

* **Option 1:** Use a preset available in the application — the best choice for beginners to choose for beginners.
* **Option 2:** Set a custom resolution via the Dimensions Tab.

**_Note:_** _To ensure the resize is perfect, find out which file format plays best with the end location of your video and convert the video clip to that version._

**Step 3:** Modify resolution to ensure the clip you get is in the right setup.

**Tip**

The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide

_Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution._

## An easier way to resize video with Wondershare Filmora

While the resize feature in Handbrake is capable of working on multiple video files at once, the user interface of the application may seem daunting to some. Hence, if you’re just starting to learn, we recommend accessing more user-friendly software, say Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . You can resize videos in the video editor by following the steps we have detailed below.

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.

**Author’s Notes:** Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).

**Tip**

If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg)

Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision

**Step 4:** Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg)

With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.

**Note:** You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the **Project Settings** option, found under the **File Tab**.

## The Bottom Line

Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.

How your screen will look once you have imported a video file.

Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.

**Tip**

The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide

_Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution._

## An easier way to resize video with Wondershare Filmora

While the resize feature in Handbrake is capable of working on multiple video files at once, the user interface of the application may seem daunting to some. Hence, if you’re just starting to learn, we recommend accessing more user-friendly software, say Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . You can resize videos in the video editor by following the steps we have detailed below.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.

**Step 1:** Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-12.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.

**Author’s Notes:** Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg)

Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision

**Step 4:** Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.

## How to Make a Countdown Video

Have you ever wanted to use Adobe After Effects to recreate a countdown timer for a rocket launch or simply create a suspenseful moment in a video by displaying how the time runs out? This tutorial will show you how. It is imperative that you become familiar with the process of creating a countdown in After Effects.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to use Adobe After Effects to put together a countdown video. This procedure is a straightforward one, and it will handle expressions as well as plugins. Stay here and read on to find out more about the various methods in which we might accomplish this goal!

Let's begin!

## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

![create new text countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-new-text-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.

## Track Mattes: The Ultimate Guide For After Effects

Are you wondering what **Track Mattes** is? In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.

For After Effects editors, **Track Mattes** can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.

In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about **Track Mattes**. We'll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.

1. [Alpha Matte](#part4-1)
2. [Alpha Inverted Matte](#part4-2)
3. [Luma Matte](#part4-3)
4. [Luma Inverted Matte](#part4-4)
5. [Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel](#part4-5)

## Part 1\. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?

A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a "hole" in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.

You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.

Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.

Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.

## Part 2\. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte

In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.

Here're some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:

1. A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.
2. A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.

## Part 3\. Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects

Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the **Transfer Control Pane** button on the bottom-left of the timeline.

![track matte in the timeline window of the after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/track-matter-in-the-timeline-window-of-the-after-effects.png)

If you are still unable to find the Track Matte option, press the **F1 key** or do the following steps in sequence:

1. Right-click on the area above your layers and select **"Columns."**
2. Scroll down and click the **"Modes"** option to enable it.

![finding the track matte option in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/finding-the-track-matte-option-in-after-effects.png)

1. **Track Matte mode, Preserve Underlying Transparency,** and **Blending Modes** will be available now.

Under Track Matte's drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma. We'll discuss these options in detail in the next section.

## Part 4\. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects

After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:

**Alpha:** This Track Matte type uses the layer's Alpha channel to determine the layer's opacity.

**Luma:** This Track Matte type uses the top layer's brightness to mask the bottom layer.

![the four track matte options in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png)

Let's find out the functions of each option one by one:

### Alpha Matte

Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.

### Alpha Inverted Matte

The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.

### Luma Matte

Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.

### Luma Inverted Matte

Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.

### Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel

When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.

Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.

![alpha channel in track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/alpha-channel-in-track-matte.png)

On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-2.jpg)

Click the **Square** icon, it is located beside the **Pencil** icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the **Proportiona**l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

Already satisfied with the cropped video? Then, select **File,** **Export** and finally **Add to Render Queue.** Check on the **Render Settings** (located bottom of the interface) to ensure high quality output.

Watch your cropped video and go ahead and repeat this with your other videos. After practicing this process many times, this will come to you as easy. If you get lost while following the instructions go back to this guide until it becomes a part of your memory.

Congratulations on making your first cropped video using After Effects! What was your experience while following through the guide? I hope that the information presented here is easy to understand and implement.

Even though it is not a free application, I hope you have experienced the advantages of using this compared to other tools. Did it come as a surprise for you that you can crop a video not just in Adobe Premiere but also in After Effects as well?

I hope that fear will not hinder you from trying this tool to crop your videos.

## Method 2: Cropping a Video using Wondershare Filmora

If you didn’t know there is also an awesome video editing software called Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) .

You can try it by searching the internet and downloading it on your computer. If simplicity is your priority then this may suit you perfectly. If you’re still hesitant then read the reviews and watch how others are using it.

There is no need to worry if you have a tight budget as downloading this would be free. You just need to go to the official site. Do not be scared of trying with something unfamiliar. I will guide you with using it and utilizing it to get the result that you dream of.

Wondershare Filmora just like the others that exist are video editors that will turn your raw videos into the vision that you like. Thanks to these applications, the gruesome process of manually cutting it by hand and permanently altering the footage are gone.

Are you done installing the application? If you have any encountered issues with installing it, you can contact customer support.

Not only does it have a straightforward and simple interface but it is also packed with useful tools that can turn your video into another level. But, you should not be overwhelmed by the number of icons and features that exist. Take a deep breath and proceed to opening it in your computer.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-5.png)

Preparation is a must especially if you have multiple videos on your computer. A good tip would be renaming them by the sequence you plan to have. And, you could also place them in folders to avoid repetition and double copies. Once you’re done, you can drag and drop your video or

click the **Import.**

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-6.png)

Go ahead and select the video clip that you want to crop. Then, click the **Crop** tool and choose if you want the **Crop** or **Pan & Zoom.** Yes, you have options on what kind of crop you want it to be.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-7.png)

An alternative way is by right clicking the video clip .Under the **Video** tab you can select the **Crop and Zoom** or **Crop to Fit** then adjust to your preferred ratio.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-8.png)

You can review the cropped video to think through if this is the portion that you want to be included. Unlike other applications, you can go back and adjust it to your liking.

If you’re finally satisfied then you can export it. Choose the output format and you can also rename the file. Clicking the settings button will offer you additional options of your video output.

After all that, you have the cropped video that you can either upload or repurpose in another content. Did you enjoy the process of cropping it in Wondershare Filmora?

Remember, that you have the option to batch crop multiple video clips on this so no need to manually crop and export it. You can see the big picture and monitor if the flow makes sense to you.

Don’t you think that the subscription is worth it? There is a trial that you could check out to test its capabilities and awesomeness.

## The Bottom Line

You are once again done with the process of checking out these two applications. After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs. The interface also could change your mind depending if you want simplicity or a challenge. Price is also a factor that can affect your willingness to use these applications. But, this guide clearly shows you that it is worth paying for.

## Why do we need to use LUTs?

You use LUTs for different reasons, as you can see from David Fincher’s example. However, here are a few more:

#### • To add emphasis to a particular scene

Sometimes, it can be challenging to communicate the importance of your message using standard color schemes. As such, filmmakers use dramatic color schemes in their content. For example, the colour scheme in the above photo emphasizes the tranquillity of the sea between contrasting landscapes.

#### • To ensure uniformity across different devices

You will use a calibration color lut to ensure a similar video quality across different TV monitors whether it is HD, UHD, or 4K. Similarly, you can use a transformation colour lut to add a cinematic effect to your film to make it appear as if your audience is viewing it in a theatre.

Camera manufacturers use different color luts to diversify their products according to their target markets. For example, you get a different lut color grading from a Sony camera as you would in a Canon.

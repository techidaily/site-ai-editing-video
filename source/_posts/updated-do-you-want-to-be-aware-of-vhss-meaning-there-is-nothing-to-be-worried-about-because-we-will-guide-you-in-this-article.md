## Do You Want to Be Aware of VHS's Meaning? There Is Nothing to Be Worried About because We Will Guide You in This Article

Videos are a person's crucial and cherished memory, and no one wants to compromise their quality. People tend to rely on several effects to exceed the quality of the beloved videos. VHS is the most used effect, popular in professional and personal videos. It stands for “Video Home System” and is often integrated with noises, color bleeding, and smooth glitches.

With **VHS-style** videos, you can not only make videos more high-class but can also intuitively define their worth. If you are new to this field, you should get familiar with the VHS effects in video. This context will provide basic information about **VHS tapes** and how to add VHS effects to videos.

## Part 1: What Is VHS Technology? An Overview of the 70s Sensation

From definition to usability, every piece of information plays an important role in your videography journey. Don't worry if you don't have video editing skills or know what **VHS means**. This section will provide you with reliable information about this:

### What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?

VHS, also known as Video Home System, are the auditory artifacts and visual glitches you see in the pictures. It creates a sense of distortion in the video, making the viewer think the camera equipment is malfunctioning. From the 1980s to the 1990s, this effect gained considerable popularity among video creators and viewers.

In recent years, retro lovers have brought this intuitive effect again into a trend to create a perfect flashback scene. The nostalgic and vintage appeal of these effects is insane. VHS is not just one effect because it divides into further categories. You are also free to select the VHS effects according to the theme of your video and the scene you are going to create.

### Key Aspects of The VHS Effects

Several key aspects are crucial to making high-quality VHS effects in the videos. You can see some of the key aspects listed and discussed here:

* **Tracking Lines of VHS:**The **VHS tapes** are integrated with magnetic strips to sort audio and video signals. However, over time, these tapes degraded, leading to glitches in playback with noticeable distortion.
* **Video Color Bleeding:**You must have noticed that color is bleeding in the VHS videos. In this, the colors in the videos are quite smudged and mixed. This together adds the unique yet smoother distortion in the videos.
* **Vintage and Glitching:**Vintage and glitches are essential to videos with VHS effects. This was initially caused by the limitations of playback equipment and signal interference. At this time, people add **glitch VHS** to the videos in a manual manner to add a sense of interference in the scene.
* **Noise and Jitters:**VHS tapes are known to be susceptible to wrappings and jitters. It causes a slightly unstable effect in the videos in the form of distorted objects. Moreover, the grainy and noisy appearance due to analog recording technology is also a part of this effect.

## Shots recording for loop masking

The first and most crucial step for creating a good loop video is to record perfect shots. Here are the steps to record video shots for loop videos.

### How to create a loop video

Step1 Set your camera or phone on a tripod. Make sure it stands still and does not move.

![set up a camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-2.png)

Step2 Set it so that you have a door on one side and enough room for the subject to walk through the door and move out of the frame.

![move out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-3.png)

Step3 Make sure all your outfits are ready.

![outfits ready](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-4.png)

Step4 Start recording on your camera. Walk through the door wearing the first outfit. Change your outfits and repeat the step with all your dresses. It would help if you kept the camera rolling while recording all these clips. Turning the recording on and off with every shot will result in many small movements.

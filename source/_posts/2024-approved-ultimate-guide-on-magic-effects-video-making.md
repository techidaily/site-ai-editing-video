In terms of video editing, visual effects which imply the presence of supernatural forces (the ones having power over natural forces) are called magic effects. They could belong to any of the effects of charm, i.e., sudden appearance, vanishing, transposition, transformation, etc. For example, in Harry Potter's classic scene, everyone waves a lit magic wand. To make this kinetic effect ourselves at home, read on.

![importing clips to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-3.png)

##### Step3 Add Your Photos and Videos to the Timeline

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline. When you have many videos and photos imported into the timeline, you can add them simultaneously.

Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. To add an item to your timeline, follow the steps mentioned.

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want to add to the timeline.
* Keep holding the right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-4.png)

##### Step4 Adding the Magic Imitating Effect

After these initial setups, you must add the effects from filmstock to our clips. These are pre-made presets of different clipart and graphics, executing unique movements and effects. For their introduction in the video, read along with the following procedure:

* After dragging and dropping the clip onto the first track on the timeline, go to the stickers tab on the top left ribbon, click it, and scroll down to the filmstock dropdown.

![finding the magic effects from filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-5.png)

* From there, open the Bling Bling Effect Pack and choose the bling light effect of your liking. Then, drag and drop that effect onto the second video track on the timeline.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-6.png)

* Adjust the element's scale according to your required size from the editing menu after double-clicking the element.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-7.png)

* Move the **playhead** to locate the brightest moment of the element. Now, right-click and select **Add Freeze Frame.** It will freeze the element at that exact frame

![adding freeze frame to the element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-8.png)

* Find the spot on the base clip's timeline where the corresponding LED used while shooting turns on. Then, bring the element to the second track and adjust its position.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** ensure the element's freeze frame starts when the anticipated magic wand light is glowing.

![adjusting the start of effect on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-9.png)

* Adjust the duration to match the end of the two clips on the timeline.

![bringing the ends of the two frames together](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-10.png)

##### Step5 Adding Keyframe Movement to the Element

It is time to add some keyframes. Once you have successfully added the effect element onto your editing workspace, you have to make it do the magic. Attaching the magic effect bling to the base (background) video is like painting your canvas for the magic to occur. It is a crucial step for bringing out those Harry Potter-like magical feats. Continue scrolling for step-by-step instructions.

* Double-click the effect element and open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-11.png)

* In the basic tab, as visible above, **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then **adjust** the element's position at the wand's tip on the preview window.

![positioning the element at the desired location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-12.png)

##### Step6 Detailing the Effect Through Keyframing

This part of the procedure is iterative. You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.

* Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand's tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element's position onto the wand's tip.

![eeadjusting the elements position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-13.png)

Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.

Finally, it is time to look at the results. Witness how you have curated a magical masterpiece.

## Best Audio Waveform Generator

For more than a century, sound waves and broadcasts have played an important role in shaping media as we know it. Here's how to implement them into your social media strategy. They have become popular in short video animations used to promote audio on social media, commonly referred to as audiograms.

Before learning everything there is to know about audiograms and how to make them, let's gain a better understanding of the significance of these patterns.

## Part 1\. What is an audio waveform?

A sound wave is the vibration of air molecules, which is how sound travels. The waveform describes the wave using a graph of how the air molecule is displaced over time.

Amplitude is the strength of a wave's action; the higher the amplitude, the more the air molecules are displaced. This also translates into loudness for the human ear; increasing the amplitude of the wave will increase how loud it appears to us. Sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waveforms are the most typical periodic waveforms.

## Part 2\. What is audio wave animation?

A waveform animation video is a short video clip that can be uploaded to social media that combines an audio file with a static background image and a straightforward waveform animation. Audio animations, an example of audio visualization, make for fantastic video content, which is increasingly valuable on ever-noisy social media platforms.

## Part 3\. Why do we use audio visualization?

We all know that there is a special way of feeling called synesthesia, which is both a psychological and a linguistic phenomenon. Similar to how you automatically link this rain scene with the sound of heavy rain when you see it. People's newly awakened senses are more about the synthesis of sensory experience with actual life experience than they are entirely about actual information. Therefore, for clean audio, enhancing it with complementary visual animation effects will improve the user's visual experience and, to some extent, offer additional information and impact to your audio.

![use audio visualization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/audio-waveform-animation-1.jpg)

## Part 4\. Best Audio Waveform Generator

Audio visualization can be presented in a variety of ways. The simplest kind of processing involves taking low-dimensional information like frequency, loudness, and rhythm and converting them into images in the form of colors, forms, strokes, etc. However, modern artificial intelligence technology can now extract high-dimensional visual attributes including style, tone, and emotion. But, for most non-technical players, such processes are obviously out of their league, therefore your best choice is to use a basic audio waveform generator. Following, we'll suggest 10 desktop or online generators so you may quickly finish the audio visualization project and create your audio-related videos.

Before coming to the trimming of a video section in detail, let us begin with how to make a video. You have two options when it comes to making a video. You can either record a video with recording software or you can shoot a video with your camera. Let us discuss both options in detail now.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

## Part 1 How to Make a Video before Trimming

Before coming to the trimming of a video section in detail, let us begin with how to make a video. You have two options when it comes to making a video. You can either record a video with recording software or you can shoot a video with your camera. Let us discuss both options in detail now.

**\-Record a video**

You can record a video with recording software when you are capturing video from your webcam or from your computer screen. There are two options you have when it comes to choose a recording software.

* Premium Recorder - A premium recorder is a professional video recording software that you have to purchase to avail all the features and functionalities. Choose the best video recorder.

**\-Shoot a video**

The second option is shooting a video with your external digital camera. You can also use your phone camera to shoot a video. For example, making vlogs, comedy skits, travel videos, or short films needs a digital camera. If you are using your phone camera, you can cut and crop the video after shooting using the video trimmer apps or online video trimmers.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

click the **Import.**

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-6.png)

Go ahead and select the video clip that you want to crop. Then, click the **Crop** tool and choose if you want the **Crop** or **Pan & Zoom.** Yes, you have options on what kind of crop you want it to be.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-7.png)

An alternative way is by right clicking the video clip .Under the **Video** tab you can select the **Crop and Zoom** or **Crop to Fit** then adjust to your preferred ratio.

## The Bottom Line

You are once again done with the process of checking out these two applications. After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs. The interface also could change your mind depending if you want simplicity or a challenge. Price is also a factor that can affect your willingness to use these applications. But, this guide clearly shows you that it is worth paying for.

What are your thoughts on both of these tools? Did you find this information to be helpful?

Check if the video is already in the interface. Find the **Magnifying** tab and zoom out the video into 50%. After that, click the **Grid** icon and **Proportional Grid**.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-2.jpg)

Click the **Square** icon, it is located beside the **Pencil** icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the **Proportiona**l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-3.jpg)

Already satisfied with the cropped video? Then, select **File,** **Export** and finally **Add to Render Queue.** Check on the **Render Settings** (located bottom of the interface) to ensure high quality output. Following that, hit the **Output To** part and decide the destination and folder where you want it to be.

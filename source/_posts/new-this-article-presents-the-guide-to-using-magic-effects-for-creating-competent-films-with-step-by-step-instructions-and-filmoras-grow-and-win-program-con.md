![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-4.png)

##### Step4 Adding the Magic Imitating Effect

After these initial setups, you must add the effects from filmstock to our clips. These are pre-made presets of different clipart and graphics, executing unique movements and effects. For their introduction in the video, read along with the following procedure:

* After dragging and dropping the clip onto the first track on the timeline, go to the stickers tab on the top left ribbon, click it, and scroll down to the filmstock dropdown.

![finding the magic effects from filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-5.png)

* From there, open the Bling Bling Effect Pack and choose the bling light effect of your liking. Then, drag and drop that effect onto the second video track on the timeline.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-6.png)

* Adjust the element's scale according to your required size from the editing menu after double-clicking the element.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-7.png)

* Move the **playhead** to locate the brightest moment of the element. Now, right-click and select **Add Freeze Frame.** It will freeze the element at that exact frame ![adding freeze frame to the element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-8.png)

* Find the spot on the base clip's timeline where the corresponding LED used while shooting turns on. Then, bring the element to the second track and adjust its position.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** ensure the element's freeze frame starts when the anticipated magic wand light is glowing.

![adjusting the start of effect on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-9.png)

* Adjust the duration to match the end of the two clips on the timeline.

![bringing the ends of the two frames together](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-10.png)

##### Step5 Adding Keyframe Movement to the Element

It is time to add some keyframes. Once you have successfully added the effect element onto your editing workspace, you have to make it do the magic. Attaching the magic effect bling to the base (background) video is like painting your canvas for the magic to occur. It is a crucial step for bringing out those Harry Potter-like magical feats. Continue scrolling for step-by-step instructions.

* Double-click the effect element and open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-11.png)

* In the basic tab, as visible above, **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then **adjust** the element's position at the wand's tip on the preview window.

![positioning the element at the desired location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-12.png)

##### Step6 Detailing the Effect Through Keyframing

This part of the procedure is iterative. You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.

* Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand's tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element's position onto the wand's tip.

![eeadjusting the elements position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-13.png)

Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.

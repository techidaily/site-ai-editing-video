Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.

**Alignment**

Don't underestimate the importance of alignment in **Lightroom collage**. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.

In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.

**Proximity**

Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:

**●** Realistic pictures should be put together.

**●** Unrelatable images should be separated.

Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.

**Theme**

The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it's not as measurable as others.

It now features an animated split-screen effect that converts multiple videos into a single compelling collage. You only have to import the clips that you want in the split-screen preview window to make the video collage. But, for photo collages, the best tool ever is Adobe Lightroom.

You get two options for creating photo collages in Lightroom: using a pre-designed template or creating a new one. It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a **lightroom collage** of pictures, follow the steps given below.

**Create a Photo Collage with a New Template**

For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it's worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.

**Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs**

Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.

![print module](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-step-by-step-tutorial-on-creating-a-lightroom-collage-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Establishing the Workspace**

After importing and editing the photos, it's time to create a workspace. Go to the "Print" panel and then to the "Print Job" menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.

**Step 3: Create a Photo Layout**

As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the "Add to Package" section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.

**Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout**

If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It's pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn't seem pleasing to your eyes.

**Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template**

Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? **Make a collage in Lightroom** using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won't get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.

**Step 1: Import the photos into the program**

Here also, you can't create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on "File" > "Add Photos" and choose the file location.

**Step 2: Download the collage layout**

Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a **photo collage in Lightroom.** You are free to download any one that appeals to you.

**Step 3: Bring in the Template**

Click on the "Print" module > "Template Browser" > "Lightroom Templates" menu. Now, import the extracted **Lightroom collage template** using the "Import" button.

![template browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/easy-step-by-step-tutorial-on-creating-a-lightroom-collage-2.jpg)

**Step 4: Insert Photos**

After finishing up the import of the template, start adding the photos to them. You can reposition them in whatever way you want. And now, you are done. Export the collage if you are satisfied with the position, color, and everything else.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●**Formatting the pictures is the easy part. The real struggle is in creating the collage. That takes a bit more time, but it's worth it in the end.

**●**You can follow any of the above steps to get your desired photo collage. So now, you can reduce your burden with Adobe Lightroom or Wondershare Filmora .

**●**We hope you followed along with this tutorial and have enjoyed reading it. Thanks for your efforts and time.

## How to Correct Lens Distortion in Videos

The distortion in your video may irritate you when you're working on the video's edit. When you take images or record sound, you frequently end up with distorted results due to lens distortion. In this article, we will discuss what lens distortion is, how it may be fixed, and the factors you need to pay attention to avoid lens distortion when taking or recording videos.

## Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion

**1\. What is lens distortion**

Distortion means that the straight rectilinear projection is not straight. In the pinhole camera model, lens distortion is measured by how far from the image's ideal projection is. From a geometric optics point of view, the scene's straight lines don't look straight in the image.

When you take a picture, the camera lens can somehow change the shape of the image. It is called camera lens distortion. In simple terms, we can tell you that this is the case because distortion in-camera is when the lens makes curved lines in an image and doesn't show the straight lines from the scene.

**2\. What cause it**

Lens distortion happens with all lenses. It is because of several things, such as how the lens is curved, how far away the subject is, and the angle at which the photo was taken. Furthermore, it changes the image in many ways, but you can see it most when straight lines at the frame's edges are no longer parallel.

Most geometric lens distortions happen when the focal distance is short (barrel distortion), long (pincushion distortion), or when a fish-eye lens is used to take a picture from a low angle (keystone distortion).

## Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?

A lot of times, with lower-end wide-angle lenses, especially action cams like GoPro, you get pretty gnarly distortion when you're filming. As we know, the Earth is round, but it shouldn't look like this when you take a picture. Indeed, it's very distorted, it has the horizon line bending all over the place, and basically, all of the lines in the video have some level of curvature.

Hence, follow all the steps below to know how to fix it:

Step1 Import your video to [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the "Camera model" based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7\. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.

Step3 To adjust the distortion, you can slide the bar to the left or the right. If you slide the bar to the right (maximum level), there will be no adjustment. However, if you slide the bar to the left, you can see it pulling those lines as high up as possible.

You can see a bit of curvature, but it looks much more natural, and all of the lines in the video look so much better.

Step4 Lastly, if you play the video back, you will see the video look much better than before.

## Part 3: How to avoid distorted lens while shooting?

**1\. Avoid very wide-angle lenses**

The more distortion there is in a lens, like a 15mm prime, the wider it is. Sometimes you need a very wide-angle lens, and distortion is unavoidable. If you have room to move back, you could try using a lens with a different focal length.

**2\. Avoid getting too close**

Doing so will enhance optical distortion in many lenses and the likelihood of perspective distortion in all lenses.

**3\. Be mindful of your composition**

There are numerous instances where distortion is acceptable or even intended. Others must be carefully examined, such as utilizing a wide-angle lens to photograph a row of people. When you get too close to a group, the distortion makes the people at each end appear considerably wider! Therefore, consider your composition. Stand back and add space around your group; if necessary, you can trim the image afterward.

**4\. Use a 50mm lens**

50mm lenses are often called "all-purpose" lenses. There is a good reason

for this. A 50mm lens is great for portraits, street photography, and many other kinds of photography, including architecture. If your subject is big, you just need space to stand back. You will see that a 50mm lens rarely distorts the image.

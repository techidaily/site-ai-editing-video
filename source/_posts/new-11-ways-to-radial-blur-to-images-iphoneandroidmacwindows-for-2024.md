## How to Concatenate Videos Using FFmpeg

Video editing is a crucial aspect of creating content for many people. Whether you're a YouTuber, a marketer, or just someone who wants to share videos with friends and family, being able to edit and manipulate your videos is key. One of the most basic video editing tasks is concatenating videos, which combines multiple files to create one cohesive video.

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to do just that, and in this guide, we'll walk you through the process of FFmpeg concatenate videos. Whether a beginner or an experienced video editor, this guide will provide you with all the information you need to seamlessly merge your videos. From installation to execution, we'll cover it all so you can streamline your video editing process.

![concat videos with ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ffmpeg-concat-videos.JPG)

## Overview and Installation of FFmpeg

FFmpeg is free, open-source project that allows you to record, convert, and stream digital audio and video. It is a command-line tool widely used in video editing and transcoding. FFmpeg can be used to concatenate videos and other tasks, such as adding subtitles, changing video resolution, and more. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a versatile and accessible tool for anyone to use.

Here's how to install FFmpeg:

Step1 **Log in** to your Ubuntu server via SSH and **update** the package index.

_$ sudo apt update_

Step2 **Install** FFmpeg and all the required dependencies

_$ sudo apt install ffmpeg_

Step3 **Verify** the version of FFmpeg that you've installed.

_$ ffmpeg -version_

## Prerequisite

Before we merge videos using FFmpeg, we must understand the various methods available to us. FFmpeg offers three ways to concatenate videos: a demuxer, a filter, or a protocol. However, each method has its own set of considerations, and the best method for you will depend on the properties of the videos you're working with.

It's crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you're merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It's essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.

### Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg "concat" demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn't require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the "concat" demuxer and "concat" protocols in FFmpeg.

**Merge Videos With the "Concat" Demuxer**

The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Create** a **.txt file and list** the paths of the video files you want to merge.

_Join\_video.txt_

_file /Users/Video/input1.mp4_

_file /Users/Video/input2.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can add more than two video files.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

![filmora export video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-05.png)

## Conclusion

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to concatenate videos in various ways. Whether you're working with videos of the same codecs and resolutions or videos with multiple audio streams, FFmpeg can handle it. However, for users new to video editing or needing experience with command-line tools, using Filmora can be a more user-friendly option. It offers a simple drag-and-drop interface and a variety of features and effects to enhance the overall look of your video.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

## Do You Use Premiere Pro and Want to Learn How to Change a Video's Frame Rate Using the Tool? Here Are the Steps that You Need to Follow

The video's frame rate is an important aspect of it. Too high of a frame rate makes the video seem unnatural. On the other hand, too low can make some videos choppy. You can fix that by changing the frame rate using a video editor. And we are here to help you learn how to do that. Here's **how to change the frame rate in Premiere Pro.**

The frame rate sometimes makes or breaks the video. So it is important to get this setting right. Suppose you made a mistake and recorded your video in the wrong setting. You can follow this guide to solve your problem.

![check frame rate in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-premiere.JPG)

## How To Check Video Frame Rate in Premiere Pro

Before we teach you how to change a video's frame rate in Premiere Pro, let's first make sure you know how to check. Maybe you don't need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.

So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?

1. Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Check the "Media" window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for "frames per second," which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.

![check video frame rate in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-frame-rate-premiere-pro.jpg)

## Reasons for Changing Frame Rate

Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.

Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.

However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the "soap opera effect." It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem "unnatural" or less cinematic.

High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That's great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it's also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.

With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video's frame rate.

## How To Change FPS in Premiere Pro

Let's dilly-dally no more. Here's a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.

### l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence

Suppose you want to keep the frame rate of most of the video the same. Only some parts need adjusting. You can change the frame rate of the sequences that need changing instead. Here are the steps to follow to achieve this:

1. Open your project in Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.
3. Choose "Sequence Settings" from the menu that appears.

![sequence settings in adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-sequence-3.JPG)

1. Click the drop-down menu for "Timebase."
2. Select the frame rate you want the sequence to be in.

![changing video sequence frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-sequence-5.JPG)

1. Click "OK."

### l Change the Frame Rate of a Video Clip

Here are the steps you should follow if you want to change the frame rate of an entire video clip.

1. Import your video clip to Premiere Pro and drag it to the timeline.
2. Go to the "Effects" tab. It's in the options at the bottom left of the screen.

![effects tab in adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-clip-2.JPG)

1. Select "Video Effects" > "Time" > "Posterize Time."

![posterize time video effect option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-clip-3.JPG)

1. Drag and drop the Posterize Time effect to the clip whose frame rate you want to change.
2. Click "Effect Controls" at the top left of the screen.
3. Select the small "arrow" button next to the "Frame Rate" text under "Posterize Time."
4. Change the frame rate to your preferred setting. For example, type "60" to make the video 60 fps.

![changing video clip frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-clip-7.JPG)

1. Click "Sequence" > "Render Selection."

And that's it! That is how you change a video clip's frame rate in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How To Make 120 FPS Videos With Premiere Pro

Videos that are 120 fps are very popular now. If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You'd want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.

Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it's a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That's obviously not the number that we want. Don't worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it's super easy.

Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:

1. Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, "Drop media here to create sequence."

![dragging video to premiere pro timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-120-fps-2.JPG)

1. Select the timeline panel. Click "Sequence" > "Sequence Settings."
2. Check the "Timebase" section. It should say "119.88 frames/second," 120 fps when rounded off.

![checking if the fps is 120](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-120-fps-4.JPG)

1. Edit the video as needed and render it. The output should stay at 120 fps.

## How To Change Video From 30 FPS to 60 FPS in Premiere Pro

Do you have a video recorded at 30 frames per second, and do you want it at 60? Here's a simple solution to that. Follow these steps in Adobe Premiere Pro to double the video's frame rate.

1. Open Adobe Premiere Pro. Click "File" > "New" > "Sequence."

![creating new sequence in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-60-fps-1.JPG)

1. Click "AVCHD" > "1080p" > "AVCHD 1080p60" > "OK."

![avchd 1080p 60 option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-60-fps-2.JPG)

1. Import your 30 fps video into Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Drag the video into the timeline.
3. Click "Keep existing settings."

![keeping the settings when importing video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-60-fps-5.JPG)

1. Right-click the video in the timeline. Select "Time interpolation" > "Optical Flow."

![optical flow option in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-60-fps-6.JPG)

1. Press the "Enter" key. Wait for the processing to finish. This can take hours.
2. Click "File" > "Export" > "Media."

![exporting the video from premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-60-fps-8.JPG)

1. Select a preset.
2. Scroll down to the "Effects" section to check if the frame rate is at 60 fps. If not, change it to 60 fps.

## Why Do We Need To Add A Camera Shake Effect To The Video?

Have you ever tried to add a simple camera shake effect to your videos? You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.

Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you're filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there's lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.

A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you're making a video that's meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that's supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:

* This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.
* Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they've seen similar videos before.
* Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.
* It's a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren't perfect humans, so we can't make perfect videos every time!"
* You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).

## How to add camera shake to video in After Effects

When it comes to video editing, knowing how to make a layer shake in After Effects is a very useful skill. Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.

### Step 1\. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file

Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.

![camera shake effects for premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Step 2\. Press the alt/option key, then click the stopwatch next to "position."

You are adding an "expression" to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.

By pressing the alt/option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside "position" and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.

### Step 3\. Enter "Wiggle (3,8)" and adjust the settings accordingly

In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle -- basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The "Wiggle (10,3)" command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.

### Step 4\. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition

In order to make the overall effect more "choppy," you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition> Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as "8" if you want a choppy feel.

![how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg)

Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.

We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.

With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.

Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.

Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup.

## Part 5: How to Split Video with Filmora

##### Step1Import your videos to Filmora Video Cutter

Launch the video cutter once it has been installed and click New Project to access the video editing interface. Now you must import the video, which must be divided into numerous portions.

![Upload files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fig-1.jpg)

Upload files

You can either drag and drop files to the media library before adding them to the timeline for editing, or you can click "Import" on the main interface and choose files from your computer.

VOB, 3GP, 3G2, MP4, FLV, AVI, MOV, F4V, M4V, TRP, M2TS, MTS, TP, DAT, WMV, MPG, MPEG, TS, MKV, ASF, DV, EVO, MOD, NSV, and TOD files are all supported by Filmora video cutter.

If your video contains a lot of distinct sequences, Filmora can help you discover the clip you want to trim. The "Scene Detection" tool will assist you in rapidly locating the part you wish to clip. To open the Scene Detection window, choose the video in the media library (not the timeline), right-click it, and select "Scene Detection."

![Detect video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fig-2.jpg)

Detect video

When you click Detect, Filmora will automatically split your films into multiple segments depending on scene changes.

##### Step2Manually trim/split/cut/delete videos

To trim video files, drag clips from the media library to the video track on the timeline and follow these steps. You may use the trim option to chop off the beginning or conclusion of a video swiftly.

You will get the starting frame, then move the play head to the ending frame and click the Split button again to get the ending part.

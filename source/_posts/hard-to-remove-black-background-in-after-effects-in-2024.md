There are different ways to do that, and we’ll discuss three solutions in this article.

## Solution 3: How to Edit TXT File and Save It into .SRT Without Any Tools

While there are different online and downloadable TXT to SRT converting tools available out there, you might not have access to them all the time. That’s when knowing “how to edit TXT file and save it as SRT file” would come in handy.

Here’s how you can edit the TXT file without using any external software and online tools:

1. If you’re using a Windows computer, then you can open your TXT document in Microsoft Notepad. For a Mac computer, you can use TextEdit. On the very first line of the document, type a number to identify the subtitle's section. Each section indicates an individual subtitle, which could be a sound or one sentence from a dialogue.
2. The next line would be the timestamp of the subtitle. _Timestamp_ follows this formatting: _hours: minutes: seconds, milliseconds._
3. In the next line, write your caption.
4. Now add double space between the next section and write it as you did for the previous section.

Now that you’ve formatted the TXT file to use it as a subtitle file, let’s save it .SRT format. Here’s how to save your file as .SRT:

1\. Go to the File tab and select Save as.

![save as srt file with notepad](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-txt-to-srt-14.jpg)

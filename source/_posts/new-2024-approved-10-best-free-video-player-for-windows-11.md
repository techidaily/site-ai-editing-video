### 03Split View

Apple has introduced the split view with EI Capitan. Spilt view provides the ability to use applications side by side while each app will remain in full-screen. It helps you to do multitasking and to do cross-referencing data between the Keynotes, Pages and Numbers.

For example – You wish to open Pages and Keynote simultaneously within Split View mode; you can start it by opening the Pages and then opening the Keynote presentation. Click and hold keynote’s green full screen icon and after holding the green screen the left half of the Mac will turn blue and then release the icon. The application will enter on full-screen, covering the remaining half screen. Repeat the steps for Pages also and you will end up with both the applications open side by side.

## Part 2 How To Use Keynote Slides

Apple’s keynote is a great option for Mac users to make beautiful slides for their presentations. Making a presentation focuses on idea or information you want to deliver to your audience. Designing a keynote slide includes, keynote slides sizes and dimensions which are very important.

Here are some important things to consider to make the best use of keynote slides.

### 01Keynote Slide Size Matters

Before designing your slides think about the screen size you’ll be presenting your presentation. Every screen has an aspect ratio. The aim is to create a keynote presentation that matches the aspect ratio of the screen on which you are going to present.

Screens on which your presentation will appear are:

**●** iPad and tablets

**●** Conference room projectors

**●** Laptop

**●** Widescreen, large format display

Setting the size of the keynote slide will ensure that your slides will match to the screen on which you are going to present. Keynote slides can be changed in different ways which includes changing the designs, dimensions and ruler options etc.

### 02Change Keynote Layout Dimensions and Size

Start off in keynote by clicking on the document option given at the top right corner. A new panel will open and all the changes will be done in that panel.When you will click on the document panel, there will be two tabs on the panels, make sure you are working on the labeled document panel.

![Adjust the slide size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Tactics-To-Make-Keynote-Slideshow-1.JPG)

On the slide size at the down side, you can set the size of the slide. By default you have two options 4:3 and 16:9 slide sizes. When you will create a new document, its size will be 4:3 by default, so before making a keynote slide make sure you check the size.

![Formatting 16:9 slide to 4:3 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Tactics-To-Make-Keynote-Slideshow-2.JPG)

##### Step3 Search for the Blur Effect

Once you have split the video, head to the “Effects” section and click on “Video Effects” from the left side. Now search “Blur” from the search bar and choose any of the blur effects from the results. Drag and apply the blur effect on the timeline.

##### Step4 Export the Edited Valorant Gameplay Video

After you have applied the blur effect, go to “Transitions” and search for the “Dissolve” transition. Once you have applied this particular transition to your video, it will generate a smooth look. Now you can easily share and save your video by hitting the “Export” button.

## 3 Ways To Stream And Record At The Same Time

The popularity of live streaming has exploded recently. A live stream is simply a video broadcast in real-time over the internet. It's a great way to connect with people directly, whether for a gaming session, a cooking show, or a Q&A.

Many reasons are there for which why you might want to live stream and record at the same time. For instance, keep a record of your gameplay or stream highlights for future editing or use your live stream to generate content for your YouTube channel.

Whatever your reasons, this article will show you how to do live streaming and recording at the same time using three different methods.

## Way 1\. Use OBS To Stream And Record Video At The Same Time

OBS, or Open Broadcaster Software, is a free and open-source tool that allows you to stream and record video at the same time, which can be useful if you want to live-stream your gameplay on Twitch or record a tutorial for YouTube.

### Key Features of OBS

### Steps

Here's an easy and quick guide on how to use OBS Studio to stream and record videos simultaneously:

Step1 Download [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com/) from the official website and install it on your computer or laptop.

Step2 Launch **OBS Studio** and go to the **Settings** menu. Find the **Recording** section under the Output tab.

Step3 Click **"Start Recording"** to manually start the recording or head to the **General Tab** and checkmark the box before **"Automatically Record When Streaming."**

## Way 2\. Use Twitch To Save Your Streams

Twitch is the most popular and best live streaming platform that allows gamers to broadcast their gameplay to a live audience and also gives them the ability to save their past broadcasts, or **"streams."**

This feature can be useful to save your live stream for later viewing or share your stream with someone who missed it.

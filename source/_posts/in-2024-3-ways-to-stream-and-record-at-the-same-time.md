## Way 2\. Use Twitch To Save Your Streams

Twitch is the most popular and best live streaming platform that allows gamers to broadcast their gameplay to a live audience and also gives them the ability to save their past broadcasts, or **"streams."**

This feature can be useful to save your live stream for later viewing or share your stream with someone who missed it.

### Features

Twitch offers a variety of features that make it a unique and powerful game streaming platform. Some of the most notable ones are:

* **Live streaming:** Twitch allows gamers to share their gameplay in real-time with other gamers around the world. This live aspect of the platform makes it unique and engaging.

**You can save your stream on Twitch in two ways:**

## Part 2: Automatically Generate your Subtitle on Kapwing

Do you want to generate subtitles for your video instantly? Kapwing subtitle maker offers an Auto-Subtitle Generator that converts your voice into subtitles. This feature supports many languages so that anyone across the world can utilize this tool. Moreover, it also offers a translating feature that can help you in converting your subtitles into another language.

However, to use this feature, you must create your user account. Also, you should upgrade your account to fully use this feature without any restrictions. If you don't have an upgraded account, you can only auto-generate subtitles for the 7 minutes video. To use the auto-subtitle generator of Kapwing, check the below steps:

Step 1 Begin by accessing the website of the Kapwing tool. Click on "Subtitles" from the "Tools" tab and then tap on the "Choose a video" button. Upload the video file on which you want to add subtitles from your PC.

![hit the choose a video option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-subtitles-with-kapwing-5.jpg)

Step 2 Once done with importing the video, click on "Subtitles" from the left section. From the new window, click on "Auto-generate." The tool will automatically create subtitles for your video by detecting the language.

Step 1 After accessing the website of Kapwing, select the "Subtitles" tool to proceed. Now select the "Choose a video" button to open the Kapwing editor window.

For macOS 10.12 or later

Step 1: Launch [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline.

![match note with the music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-1.jpg)

Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use "M" from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.

![add markers and adjust video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg)

Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.

Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the "Effects" tab to blur the video clips.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the "Animation" and then "Customize." Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the "Scale" percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!

## Part 1\. How to Add Text Animation in After Effects

You may roughly follow the instructions in this article and produce a similar effect with After Effects if you are familiar with that application and prefer it for graphics and animations. Using Adobe AE, let's demonstrate how to make a text animation effect.

### 1\. After Effects' Fly-in Text Animation

Fortunately, creating this type of effect inside of Adobe AE is really fairly simple and doesn't need downloading and installing any other templates. For those who are knowledgeable with AE and want to create the effect, that is a significant bonus.

**Steps to Add Fly-in Text Animation in AE:**

Step1 The first step is adding your Title Layer to a Comp that has a colorful backdrop and create a route for the text to follow using the Pen tool.

![title layer styles premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/title-layer-styles-premiere.jpg)

Step2 In the next step, rotate the Text menu, Path Options, and Layer down. Using the Pen Tool, change the path to the mask you just created. To advance a few frames, use your keyboard's directional keys.

![select pen tool premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-pen-tool-premiere.jpg)

Step3 Afterwards, set a Keyframe for First Margin at frame 0; reduce the value to whatever is appropriate for your Path and change the First Margin value to 0 at frame 30 to center the text on the path's length.

![key frmae margin premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/key-frmae-margin-premiere.jpg)

Step4 Lastly, give this keyframe an Easy Ease to setup the Fly-in text animation.

### 2\. After Effects Typewriter Animation

A great pre-set for animators wishing to produce effects of text on paper is Typewriter Text Presets. The Bevel settings, which let you create the essential indentation effect, are more stunning than the pre-speed set's control. A fun and simple method to show titles in your films is using typewriter effects. While the classic typewriter effect could seem a bit antiquated, combining it with additional text effects will result in something fresh and interesting.

**Steps to Add Typewriter Animation in After Effects:**

Step1 In the Media Viewer, choose the Text tool and enter your title. Then, use the Character panel to change the font, color, and size.

![composition settings premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/composition-settings-premiere.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Make a Countdown timer in After Effects

Developed by Adobe, After Effects is one of the most widely used animation software that is used for creating and editing videos using a wide range of functions supported by the application. Among other functions, After Effects facilitates adding a countdown timer to your videos and this task can be done in multiple ways.

Listed below are these different methods.

### Method 1\. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using Expression

Step1 Launch the software and then choose to Create a new Text Layer.

![after effects text layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-01.jpg)

Step2 Open the text options and click on Alt + Click on your PC (For the Mac -Option + Click) on the stopwatch of the Source Text.

Step3 Next, you need to insert the expression - timeToCurrentFormat() inside the expression area.

Step4 Now, set the composition frame rate to 60fps which will make it look like an actual countdown timer.

Step5 Now count it down, pre-compose everything and then reverse the speed of the composition.

Composition speed can be reversed, right-click on the same, go to Time and then choose Time Reverse Layer.

![after effects expressions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-02.jpg)

Above are the steps for **timer expression after effects** process.

### Method 2\. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using the Timecode plugin

In this method, you can use the Timecode plugin instead of using the “**timeToCurrentFormat()**” expression.

While using this **after effects timer** method, you would need to add a plugin to the New Solid that will create a timer layout automatically.

Next, follow the process as in the previous steps, and a countdown timer can be added.

### Method 3\. Creating a simple Countdown in After Effects

Step1 First of all, launch the software and then create a Text Layer.

Step2 Next, open the text options using Alt + Click for PC and Option + Click for Mac at the stopwatch of Source Text.

Step3 Next, at the expression area insert the expression- Math. Floor(-time) +10\. Here in the place of 10, you can choose any number desired and this will be the starting countdown value.

Above we have learned 3 ways by which After Effects can be used for adding a countdown timer. Though these are workable methods, at times you may have issues with them and thus an alternate tool may be needed.

## Part 2: Why Countdown timer is not working in After Effects

Though a lot of people use After Effects for creating countdown times, there are situations when the software will not serve your purpose. We have collected some of the common reasons that lead to the countdown timer not working in After Effects.

**Software version out of date**

If the software version of After Effects is out of date, then several features including Countdown Timer may be missing or have issues with the same.

**Incorrect values or command**

If the value for the countdown or the statement is incorrect while using After Effects, the countdown timer will not work properly.

**The steep learning curve of the software**

After Effects comes in with a wide range of features, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the procedure to use the tool. Thus, the software has a steep learning curve which can be a problem for a lot of users and have issues while creating a countdown timer.

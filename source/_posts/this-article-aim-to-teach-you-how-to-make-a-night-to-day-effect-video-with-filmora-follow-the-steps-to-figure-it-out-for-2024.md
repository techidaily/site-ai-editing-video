## This Article Aim to Teach You How to Make a Night to Day Effect Video with Filmora. Follow the Steps to Figure It Out

Do you wish you could control when it's nighttime to daytime? It would make getting ready in the morning much faster! This tutorial will show you how to use the keyframe and mask feature in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make a remarkable night-to-day transition.

## How-to Guide

**_1) Preparation_**

For this effect, you will need to shoot two footage shots with the same frame. The first is for the daytime clip, and the second is for nighttime.

But before that, you need to prepare some things, such as:

1. Tripod to ensure your camera stays at the same point, so the frame doesn't change.
2. Mark the place where you want to shoot the scene. You can put a marker on the floor to ensure that you perform at the same spot in different shots.

Once done, let's start shooting to get the footage.

**_2) Steps_**

**Shooting footages**

First, get the daytime shot. For this tutorial, we will pretend that you are walking and transitioning into nighttime at the spot you have marked.

![get the daytime shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-1.gif)

Now, let's film the nighttime clip. You will walk through the living room and do the same movement again at the same spot. You can dim the light and change the camera's white balance settings to bluer to create a night feeling.

![film the nighttime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-2.gif)

After you have both clips that you need, let's go to Filmora and start editing.

**Night-to-day transition**

Step1 Launch Filmora and import the footage into the program. If you haven't installed it, you can download Filmora on their website here: <https://filmora.wondershare.com>

Step2 Place the nighttime video clip on the first video track of the timeline and place the daytime clip on the top.

![place the daytime clip on the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-3.jpg)

Step3 Find the spot where you want to create a transition between the day and nighttime. Then, you can delete the unwanted part.

![create a transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-4.jpg)

Step4 Since the transition for this tutorial is where the subject started waving, make sure to place the daytime clip at the same time the subject started waving in the nighttime clip. Hence, the timing in both clips syncs.

**Masking transition**

For the next step, we will make a masking transition with the Filmora mask feature.

Step1 Double-click the daytime clip on the timeline. In the Filmora setting, find the **Mask section > Circle**. You can see the mask is applied in the preview screen.

![double-click the daytime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-5.jpg)

Step2 Scroll down the setting and click add a keyframe at the beginning of the clip.

![scroll down the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-6.jpg)

Step3 Change the scale of the mask to the smallest number and adjust the Width and Height down to 0\. You can set the blur strength to 15 to make the transition edge smoother.

![change the scale of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-7.jpg)

Step4 Move the play head to find the spot where you want the mask fully opens up, then add another keyframe. Change the scale of the mask to 2 and the Width and Height to 50\. Make sure the mask occupies the whole frame.

![add another keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-8.jpg)

Now, if you play back, you can see the nighttime becomes daytime through the mask.

![nighttime becomes daytime through the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-9.gif)

If the movement in the two clips is a bit off, you can fix it by adding more keyframes on the mask.

**_3) Pro tips_**

You can add one more effect in Filmora to make it more magical. To do this, open the Effects window on the top left and find “Heartbeat” under the Basic section.

![add one more effect in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-10.jpg)

Drag and drop it onto the third video track and start the effect when the mask opens up. Then, trim the effect length to match the movement. Adjust the speed of this effect if needed.

![youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-learning-ai-marketing-youtube-1.jpg)

Artificial intelligence is one of the recent and most famous advancements in technology. The introduction of artificial intelligence in the industry has proved to be a boon. The introduction of artificial intelligence has made things easy to manage in every industry. AI can easily be applied in any industry be it manufacturing or the IT sector. Artificial intelligence has made work easier and increased the efficiency of people working in different areas. Even YouTube has started using AI techniques for many tasks. In this article, we have listed some of the applications of **AI on YouTube**.

#### In this article

01 [How Is YouTube Using Artificial Intelligence?](#Part 1)

02 [How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?](#Part 2)

## Part 1 How Is YouTube Using Artificial Intelligence?

Tools like artificial intelligence and machine learning have made things easier to manage. Even the introduction of **Artificial Intelligence on YouTube** has helped a lot to smoothen its procedure. YouTube being one of the most engaging websites has applied **YouTube Intelligence** to manage all its activities smoothly. Read further to know how YouTube is using artificial intelligence currently!

![youtube 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-learning-ai-marketing-youtube-2.jpg)

### 01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content

One of the main applications of **AI on YouTube** is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the "Trashy Video Classifier" to scan and examine the feedback.

Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.

### 02Add New Video Effects

The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment. You can now swap out backgrounds from videos with just one click due to the in-built AI features on YouTube. This AI neural feature is prepared by **Google’s AI YouTube** researchers to make it easier for the AI algorithms to understand video patterns. This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.

### 03Maintain Age Restrictions

Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.

YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.

Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.

### 04"Up Next" Feature

The "Up Next" feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.

This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his/her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.

### 05Training on Depth Prediction

YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that **Google’s AI YouTube** researchers used the "mannequin challenge" to understand depth predictions.

In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).

### 06Tackle Fake News

Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.

YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.

## Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?

![youtube recommendation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-learning-ai-marketing-youtube-3.jpg)

YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.

YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.

YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his/her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.

YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.

YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016\. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the "borderline content".

## Part 2 **12 Great AI Video Ideas to Bring More Traffic**

Now, let us know 12 **AI video ideas** that can become viral and get more likes and views :

### 01Idea 1: Know your Interest

Before starting a YouTube channel or posting a video, know your area of interest first. Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it's easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target.

For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals/ cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video. Similarly, if you choose a gaming-related topic, do not be more general about gaming.

Be specific towards a particular section of games like mobile gaming/ desktop/ virtual to reach more audience, and it does not seem boring to the audience.

### 02Idea 2: Interview Questions

As many students graduate every year, the competition for jobs has increased. People are more interested in getting an appointment as soon as possible, and for that, they need to prepare for the interview thoroughly. A video containing the main topics for the discussion that has references for the interview questions would benefit the students. It can engage with people within no time. Also, if the video is more specific to the department-wise interview questions/ job-level interview questions, it would reach more people and be more helpful to them.

### 03Idea 3: Full Course in Any Technology

Apart from the entertainment-related videos, education-related videos will be more helpful and engaging. Any video related to any technology course can get more views. Using **the YouTube video idea generator AI** tool, you can generate more unique videos related to education. Instead of giving a brief idea of the technology, it's better to pick up a few topics and explain them in detail so that it would be helpful for interviews too. You can use AI technology to add a voice-over and a small summary at the end of the video so that the main points get revised once again.

### 04Idea 4: Cooking Ideas

Cooking is one of the most trending topics on YouTube. Whatever the language might be, cooking-related videos can get more views, create more creativity, and engage with the audience. You can choose a dish from any cuisine and make a video. You can add slow motion/ fast forward actions and small creative animations using AI.

### 05Idea 5: Art and Craft ideas

Recently, people have seem more interested in the interior design of the house. For such people, art and craft ideas might be more helpful. Also, nowadays, schools are encouraging students in other circular activities and studies. These videos might be more attractive to the school's students. Also, in crafts, select a specific area and make videos on that so that the video will be short and crisp, and easily understandable to the viewers. You can also add a voice-over while doing the craftwork to make it more transparent for the viewers.

### 06Idea 6: Photo and Video Editing Related Videos

## Part1: When Do You Need a Hand Shake Effect?

![hand shake effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/final-cut-pro-camera-shake-effect-2.jpg)

Adding effects to your videos is a great way to make them more impactful. However, you need to apply them correctly for them to be effective. The following information explores different aspects of the Final Cut Pro camera shake effect, including its definition, why video creators use it, and how best to apply it.

### What are hand shake effects for?

Hand shake effects are video adjustments you apply to specific scenes that make the shot vibrate. Depending on the software you use, there are multiple variations of the effect. In addition, developers refer to it by different names. For example, Final Cut Pro users know it as the earthquake effect, which is a preset video effect in most versions of the software.

Typically, video creators use the Final Cut Pro camera shake effect to add energy to their videos. As such, their scenes are more dramatic and encourage you to pay more attention to the video. For example, you can apply the effect to indicate the arrival of the villain in your video. In addition, the effect will be more impactful if the villain is a giant.

You can also use the camera shake video effect for the following purposes:

* Break the monotony in a scene. Applying this scene after a long dialogue scene will give your audience a brief respite, allowing them to regain their focus.
* The camera shake effect can also be an effective tool to build your brand identity. Instead of applying it during the screenplay, you can use it in the end credits to introduce your logo to audiences. Furthermore, you can include a creative sound track for additional emphasis.

### What kind of shots are best for such an effect?

The best shot to apply the camera shake effect are still shots. This is because they give you extra creative room with the scene since the subjects are facing the camera directly from a level angle. As such, you can customize unique motion patterns for each subject when applying the camera shake effect.

### Is it better to hand shake when shooting or add the effects?

Although it may seem tempting to physically shake the camera when shooting, most filmmakers prefer to add the effect during editing. This is because shaking the camera during shooting may result in unusable shots in post-production. For example, shooting a car scene from a hand-held camera in the passenger seat often results in shaky footage. As such, video creators mount the camera on a tripod to capture still shots and then add the camera shake during post-production.

For example, for YouTube, the commonly used aspect ratio is 16:9, which is a standard for almost all videos. However, for TikTok, the required aspect ratio is 9:16.

The video’s original aspect ratio is based on the default settings of the recording device. Some phones and tablets provide the option of changing your video’s aspect ratio before you start recording. But it can also be changed afterward with the help of editing software.

Social media apps and websites require you post images and videos of a specific size. And if you post your content in its original dimensions it most probably be will get cropped in the wrong places and will diminish the quality of your video or image.

## FAQs About Changing Aspect Ratio in iMovie

**1\. What is the standard aspect ratio for YouTube Videos?**

On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for videos on YouTube is 16:9\. If your video has a different aspect ratio, YouTube will change it automatically to a size that is suitable for the website. But, it may ruin the quality of the video, or black bars might appear on the sides of the aspect ratio that is too small.

**2\. What resolution does iMovie support?**

The resolution of the first film or video clip that you add to your timeline will define the resolution of your entire iMovie project. The latest versions of iMovie can support 4K and videos with frame rates higher than 30 frames per second.

**3\. Can I crop a video in iMovie?**

Of course, you can crop a video in iMovie. To do so, open a project in iMovie and click on the “Crop to Fill” button. The video will appear in an adjustable frame. Now you can drag the frame and set it to the size you want.

**4\. How do I change movie dimensions in iMovie 10?**

You can only change the size of your movie/video when you share/export your project. Go to the “size” option after clicking on “File” to change the dimensions of your movie.

**5\. How do I compress videos in iMovie?**

Click on the “share” option after clicking on “File”. The video can be compressed for Facebook, Email, Vimeo, and more. Select the option for which you want to compress the file. You may have to make small changes for large videos.

### Final Word

Aspect ratio is simply defined as the relationship between the width and height of an image, video, or screen. Various video posting platforms have a standard aspect ratio for videos. So. Before posting your video creation, you have to make sure that the aspect ratio of your video aligns with the website standards.

To tweak the aspect ratio of your videos, you can use iMovie, which is a powerful [video editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and iOS devices. You can also use Wondershare Filmora which is the best alternative to iMovie and is highly compatible with both Mac and Windows devices.

 Cons

* Windows Movie Maker contains unlimited audio and video tracks, yet it provides just one accessible one at a time. Hence, if you wish to include some other audio or music track, you may prepare the video, thereby sending it to the ultimate file.
* It isn’t uninstallable using any remove or add control panel. Also, it is impossible to do video overlaying.
* This app requires much patience because it is prone to crashes. Moreover, you'll require enough time and effort to do video reversing. It often becomes frustrating for all advanced editors to cut clips into small parts and then add them back. Hence, Windows Movie maker isn't good for professional video editors.
* Windows Live MovieMaker can crash and freeze and is known to suffer frequent crashes. Hence, ensure saving often and avoid creating complex videos. Also, you cannot perform complex editing and can now prepare single audio and video track.

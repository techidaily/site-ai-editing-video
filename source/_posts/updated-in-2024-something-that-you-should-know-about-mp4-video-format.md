## How to Set Up Twitch Green Screen

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

**Pro tip**:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

**Pro tip**:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### XBOX

It is a video gaming brand created and owned by Microsoft. The brand consists of five video game consoles, as well as applications(games), streaming services, an online service by the name of Xbox network, and the development arm by the name of Xbox Game Studios. The brand was first introduced in the United States in November 2001, with the launch of the original Xbox console.

**Steps on Using Xbox Green Screen**

Make your Xbox console reflect your personal style by changing its look and feel. Choose a favourite colour, update your background with game art or a customised image, or select a different theme.

**Choose your color**

The color you choose will appear in tiles and accents on your Xbox. It also follows you to any console you sign in to.

1. Press the Xboxbutton  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalisation > My color & theme > My color.
2. Select a color, and then select OK.

****Choose your background**

Your background appears where you’d expect it to—in the background of Home. It can be a solid color or an image, such as game art, achievement art, a screenshot, or a customized image.

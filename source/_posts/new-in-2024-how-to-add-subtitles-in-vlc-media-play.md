##### Step1Download and Install the Software

The first step in creating an intro video requires the user to download and install the Filmora software in Windows or MacOS computers.

##### Step2Add Color Templates

After installing, wait until the installation is finished. Launch Wondershare Filmora and go to MEDIA tab at the top left of the interface and select the best suitable background color for your intro video from the dropdown menu in the MEDIA tab. Drag your cursor over the tile of the color you wish to use as a background and click to add the icon that appears in the center to add it to the timeline.

![media for use 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/media-for-use-01.png)

Additionally, if you don’t prefer the preset backgrounds and colors, Filmora lets you use your own background image or video clip. For this, select PROJECT MEDIA > click anywhere inside the media window > import media file of your choice. After importing the file, click on the imported file to add it to the timeline.

##### Step3Select and add audio effect to your Intro Video

Your video automatically grasps a lot of viewers’ attention with a spice of some music/audio in the background. To adorn your intro video further, you can add audio/music effect to your intro video using the inbuilt music and sound effects from the library. If you want to listen to a track from the inbuilt library collection of audio and music, double click on the thumbnail.

![types of audio win1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/types-of-audio-win-1.png)

Click the AUDIO tab. Choose from Recommended audio files or import your own audio. Once, you find your desired audio/music file, drag and drop it to the audio track below the video.

##### Step4Add Text/Logo to your Intro Video

Click the ‘TITLE’ tab. To customize, choose title options from Recommended or add your own custom design. To change, format, and animate the text as needed, click on your desired preset or custom title and double click or drag it to the bottom area of the main library to insert a title.

![add titles win](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-2.png)

Also, you need to adjust the position and duration of the title to get a better view. In the intro video, it is recommended to add your logo or slogan as well. To add your logo, drag and drop it to the track above the video, and adjust its position and size.

##### Step5Add Effects to your Intro Video

Go to ‘EFFECTS’ tab, choose a category from the top-left pane, and click and drag your preferred effect from the Effects library to the timeline. Adjust the playback duration by dragging the right handle of the track in the timeline as explained above. Optionally, double-click the Effects track to customize the appearance as needed.

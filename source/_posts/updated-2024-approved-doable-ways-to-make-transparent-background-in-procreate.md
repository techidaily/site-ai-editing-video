Wondershare Filmora is a versatile platform for creating or editing slow motions with smartphone services. You can access the application from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wondershare.filmorago&hl=en&gl=US) or [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/filmora-ai-video-editor-maker/id1019382747) and start editing instantly.

![filmora app for smartphones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/best-templates-to-create-slow-motion-videos-on-capcut-11.jpg)

### Method 1\. Using the Normal Speed Option

The normal method in this **CapCut slow-mo edit** alternative uses playback speed. It involves a simple slider positioning and some enhancement options. Here is how to create a slow motion in the Filmora app using the standard approach:

**Step 1\.** After downloading the Filmora application, navigate towards the top tools. From there, select the “Speed” option and choose a clip for import.

![open app and access speed section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/best-templates-to-create-slow-motion-videos-on-capcut-12.jpg)

**Step 2\.** Select the “Normal” section and drag the playback towards the left. This will slow down the video, and you can set the speed up to 0.2x for slo-mo. After speed settings, click the “ü” icon, and if you want, do other settings.

![select normal speed adjustment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/best-templates-to-create-slow-motion-videos-on-capcut-13.jpg)

**Step 3\.** Once you are done with post-slow motion settings, click the “Export” button.

### Method 2\. Using the Speed Curve Option

This method involves slightly advanced speed settings for slow-motion creation. This method features many templates alternative to **CapCut slow-mo templates.** Further, you can use the custom setting template to edit as per your taste. Here is how to create a slow motion using Filmora’s speed curve:

**Step 1\.** Repeat the same process of importing the video and go to the “Curve” section. Select a pre-designed speed template if it fits your video. If not, go for the “Customize” template, and a panel will display.

![access curve speed section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/best-templates-to-create-slow-motion-videos-on-capcut-15.jpg)

**Step 2\.** In this panel, adjust the slider position in the downward direction. This will slow down your video at specific durations. You can also enable the “+ Add beat” option for audio adjustments.

![adjust speed ramp graph](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/best-templates-to-create-slow-motion-videos-on-capcut-16.jpg)

Editing shortcuts are excellent. They allow you to save up a lot of time. Some people prefer to use a mouse only to edit their videos, but professionals always use a keyboard.

### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

## Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps

Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using **After Effects mask tracking**, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use **Track Mask in After Effects**, you can follow these steps:

##### Step 1

Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.

### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

##### Step 3

You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add **alpha matte in After Effects** or other types from here.

## Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps

Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using **After Effects mask tracking**, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use **Track Mask in After Effects**, you can follow these steps:

##### Step 1

Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.

![use pen tool to mark boundary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

##### Step 2

Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select "Track Mask." This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the "Method" option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn't moving much, you can choose a simple option such as "Position."

![set method for tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-6.jpg)

##### Step 3

Tap the "Analyze Forward" icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set "Mask Mode" from the timeline to "Subtract." This will remove the selected object from the clip.

![analyze and change mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-7.jpg)

##### Step 4

To fill in the details, go to the "Window" menu from the top and select "Content Aware Fill." Once you see the panel on the screen, set the "Alpha Extension" slider to a number of your choice and click on "Generate Fill Layer."

## How to Zoom Video in VLC Media Player

Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.

You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.

## Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom

VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.

Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.

Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.

Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.

Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg)

Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg)

Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu

Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.

Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.

Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-vlc-zoom-options.jpg)

Otherwise, you can press Shift + Z keys together to try out different zoom options.

## Part 3: Zoom VLC Video Using Magnifier

If you are using VLC Media Player on your Windows desktop computer, you can use the inbuilt Magnifier tool to zoom into a video that you are playing on VLC. You can zoom into videos to read any text in the background but this leads to low resolution and distortion. You can zoom in by 16 times which is the highest among all the three methods. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom video using Magnifier tool.

Step1Open VLC Player and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Start menu on Windows and search for “Magnifier”.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-vlc-video-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Click on Magnifier App. Once it opens, place the mouse pointer on the video and you will see its magnified version.

Step4Press Windows and “+” keys to zoom in while press Windows and “-“ keys to zoom out.

## Part 4: VLC Alternative to Zoom in Videos

You can also read any text on the video comfortably. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an alternative to VLC Media Player for zooming into videos.

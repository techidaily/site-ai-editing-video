## Change Video Speed with FFmpeg

Have you ever wanted to speed up or slow down a video? Maybe it was too long, or you wanted to draw out an exciting part of the video without having to watch the boring parts.

In this article, we will be showing you how to use FFmpeg to speed up and slow down your videos using CLI. You'll also find some other useful FFmpeg commands that you can use on your videos.

Finally, we will explain how to automate these commands so that you can run them on all your videos with ease.

![how to automate these commands](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. [What is FFmpeg?](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html)

FFmpeg is a free and open-source cross-platform software project that can record, convert, and stream audio and video. It was developed by Fabrice Bellard in 2000\. It has since become one of the most popular tools for transcoding media content on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows NT, and more.

One of its lesser-known capabilities is to speed up or slow down videos in just about any design you can think of — with either the audio or the video synced to the other if desired.

### [Uses of FFmpeg](https://ottverse.com/what-is-ffmpeg-installation-use-cases/)

FFMPEG is a command-line tool that can manipulate and transcode video files. Its uses are as follows:

* FFmpeg can create, trim, join or separate video clips on the fly and encode them into formats including MPEG, VOB, M2TS, TS, RMVB, or AVI.
* It can be used for Video processing, Video packaging support, Video compression, Audio, and Video container support, FFplay, and FFprobe.
* It also has extensive options for altering the look of an image in just about any way imaginable. Whether you want to change the brightness, hue, saturation, or perform multiple operations like subsampling (resizing) without reducing quality—the list goes on!

You could think of it as the Swiss army knife for video manipulation tasks. The interface might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, all commands are broken down into simple English phrases.

The most important thing to know before getting started with this is how to use FFmpeg's -i and -v flags for input and output, respectively. To apply effects like slow motion playback or fast motion playback, use these flags in tandem with one another when specifying which file should be edited.

### Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg

FFmpeg has many benefits over other video editing software because it is free and open source, meaning that you have access to the code so that you can modify it if needed. Thus, it's a better option when compared to other video editing software such as Avidemux, QuickTime Pro 7, and Adobe Premiere Elements 12\. Some of these benefits include:

* Being able to edit videos on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X);
* FFmpeg has features to speed up and slow down video;
* Being able to convert from one format into another seamlessly;
* An extensive amount of features are at your disposal.

Some of the drawbacks are that some settings are not configurable, like with YouTube's built-in editor. The main disadvantage, though, would be the lengthiness of the program's installation process: not only do you need to download FFmpeg itself but also three external libraries like libx264, libmp3lame, and libfaac; then you must compile all six packages before the installation completes. Luckily this process doesn't take very long.

Another possible disadvantage is the time required for downloading the various resources since they may not be readily available on standard file hosting sites such as Mediafire or Dropbox (though they can be found through third-party websites). If you're looking for something more robust than Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, we recommend checking out FFmpeg.

## Part 2\. How to Speed Up a Video in FFmpeg?

FFmpeg can be used to speed up videos. It's not the only option, but it's one of the most common ways to make your videos faster. If you want your video to be faster, then FFmpeg is the right tool for the job. Some speed-up features include: FFmpeg speed up video and audio, ffmpeg speed up video mp4, ffmpeg change video speed, and so on.

### The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide to speed up a video in FFmpeg

The presentation timestamp (PTS) of each video frame can be modified to alter the pace of a video stream.

Step1 Open a terminal and type in FFmpeg. This will open the program.

![open the program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-2.png)

Step2 Drag and drop the video file onto the window.

Step3 This is accomplished with the command -filter:v "setpts=."

Step4 According to the documentation, fast motion requires: -filter:v setpts=0.5\*PTS.

![fast motion requires](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-3.png)

Step5 Click Enter.

![click enter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-4.png)

Step6 The result would be a sped-up version of your video.

### Major approaches to speed up a video in Filmora

As we know that Filmora has the option to change the speed of a video, so let's find out step-by-step how to do that; you can also watch this [Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII):

### Method 1: Use the 'Fast' or 'Slow' option to change the speed

Just as simple as the heading is, this option is pretty straightforward, but you cannot decide how much speed you want to add to your video or how slow you want it to be.

### Method 2: Changing Uniform Speed in Wondershare Filmora

You need to check your video's FPS and import your clip first.

Pick your preferred video. Go to the menu and select "Download." After hitting the "Plus" button, you may maintain the video's quality by choosing "Match to Media."

![go to the menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-2.PNG)

After the movie has loaded, you have two options: double-clicking the clip or selecting the speed option provided below the screen.

![double clicking the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-3.PNG)

A window appears when we double-click the chosen video. We shall navigate to the "SPEED" section beneath this window. Additional "Uniform Speed" and "Speed Ramping" panels may be found on this speed panel. We shall operate within the uniform speed panel to alter the video's tempo consistently. A slider is provided for us to adjust the movie's pacing.

The general speed of the film is continually increased or decreased when we choose the option for constant pace. If we choose the speed option on the screen, it gives us a built-in range of numbers that we can use to change the video's pace in addition to presets like rapid and regular slow.

![rapid and regular slow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-4.PNG)

Once we click "OK," the video's tempo adjusts automatically.

### Method 3: Adjusting the Fast/Slow motion to fit your movie using the Speed Ramping option

To set up the speed ramping feature for your video, double-clicking the video will give us access to the "SPEED RAMPING" option in the speed panel. When we select the speed ramping option, we see a range of graphs. Each graph shows a number of tempo variations that we may use in our movie.

For Instance, when we select the "MONTAGE" preset, the video's tempo changes based on how many keyframes we choose and at what rate. As previously stated, as the graph rises above one and falls below one, the movie's tempo will slow down, increasing its regular speed.

![increasing its regular speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-8.PNG)

Moving these keyframes higher will make the video go more quickly, while moving them downward will make the movie move more slowly. We may also add more keyframes by using the add button up top, as seen in the image. When satisfied with our results, we will produce the video after pressing the "OK" button.

Watch this video and know more about speed ramping.

## Conclusion

## Free Ways to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures: No Copyright

The digital landscape is bustling with content creators showcasing their talent, brands promoting their products, and educators teaching various skills. Amidst all this digital hustle, have you ever stopped to wonder how some creators seamlessly integrate themselves into dreamy, otherworldly, or even fantastical backgrounds?

How does one moment show them standing in their living room, and the next, they’re strolling through the sandy beaches of the Maldives or floating in space?

The answer to these mesmerizing effects is the magic of green screens.

* [Part2: Free Websites to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures](#part2)

## Part1:What is Green Screen Footages and Application Scenarios

The concept of the green screen, or the green screen mobile frame, isn't new. Hollywood has used it for decades to transport actors to distant planets, into the heart of battles, or atop treacherous mountain peaks. The principle is simple: film your subject against a vibrant green backdrop, then use software to replace that green with any video or image you choose.

So, why green?

The color green is distinct, easily distinguishable, and not typically worn as a primary color in clothing. This makes it simpler for software to isolate and replace without accidentally morphing the subject into the new background. The result is a clean, nearly flawless integration of the subject with whatever setting or scene you can imagine.

But it’s not just about transporting subjects to new locations. A green screen mobile frame or video green screen frame allows for interactive presentations, imaginative storytelling, and even sophisticated effects, like adding dynamic weather elements or supernatural phenomena. It can turn a static, dull scene into something vibrant, interactive, and engaging.

**Application Scenarios:**

1. **Entertainment & Films:** This is the most obvious. From massive Hollywood productions to amateur short films, green screens create different worlds, enhance scenes with visual effects, or simply transport characters to diverse locations.
2. **Education:** Educators use green screens for virtual field trips or to create interactive lessons, making learning more dynamic and interesting.
3. **Gaming & Streaming:** Have you ever seen a game streamer with just their figure visible over the gameplay? That's a green screen at work.
4. **Digital Marketing:** Brands use it to produce compelling ads without the hefty cost of actual locations or sets.
5. **Social Media Content:** TikTokers, YouTubers, and Instagram influencers employ green screens to add a layer of creativity and uniqueness to their content, standing out in the ever-crowded space.

The magic of green screens is everywhere, bridging the gap between imagination and reality. With the rise of accessible technology and software, what was once restricted to big-budget studios is now at the fingertips of anyone with a camera, a green cloth, and a vision. And with the platforms we're about to delve into, sourcing green screen mobile frame HD content has never been easier. So, ready to jump into this world?

## Part2: Free Websites to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures

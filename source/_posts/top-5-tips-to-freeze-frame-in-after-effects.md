03 [Compared with Filmora, What Are the Advantages of Freeze-frame After Effects?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up.

In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

## Goal of a Video Introduction to Follow

Making intro video is not just only in doing a YouTube channel but you can also use this guide for any businesses like brand presentation, educational etc.

Step1 Start by introducing yourself.

Step2 Get into details.

Step3 Add a call to action.

Step4 Add personalization to your video.

Step5 Video Length.

### 1\. Start by introducing yourself

You can always start your intro by introducing yourself but don't just state your name and what

you do, tell them why you do it, what your core values are and what motivates and dives you to

do this kind of career. Because you all know doing vlog on YouTube is a job, work, and a career.

Share emotions with your audience, and help them relate to you. Doing so is going to help you stand out immediately from the crowd and get audiences interested enough to watch the remainder of your video's content.

### 2\. Get into details

Tip is always direct to the point, add a few facts about yourself, like your interest or previous experiences or who you are as a person. If you are a business owner and would want to talk about your business you can always share how it started.

If we are talking about the YouTube intro video. Every good YouTube intro video usually includes beneficial information for subscribers and viewers. Add any short important text that you feel is necessary from the video titles, your YouTube channel name, and social media handles. Keep your informative text in a consistent format and branding style.

### 3\. Add a call to action

if you have successfully maintained the interest of your viewer until the very end of your video, use this opportunity to invite them to engage with your content more. It's worth including a call to action in each video. Take a full advantage of YouTube to provide your audience with your social media channels and maybe a link or two to your other videos that might interest them,

### 4\. Add personalization to your video

Even though an intro can be more than logo animation, the latter should still be a part of it. Otherwise, there's a sense that something is messing. Include eye catchy visuals effects to your videos to stands out, so that people can easily remember your YouTube channel.

![personalize youtube intro video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/personalize-youtube-intro-video-filmora.jpg)

### 5\. Video length

A long intro, even if it's spectacular, can get boring once your audience has seen it a few times. An ideal length for intros is up to 8-10 seconds only. Just enough time to deliver your message and branding, and hook audiences in for the rest of the video. Any longer than that, and you might lose viewers who are waiting to see the video that they clicked on.

In the era of social media, tempting distractions and short attention spans, it's critical to keep your content as short and sharp as you can.

## Goal of a Video Introduction to Follow

Making intro video is not just only in doing a YouTube channel but you can also use this guide for any businesses like brand presentation, educational etc.

Step1 Start by introducing yourself.

Step2 Get into details.

Step3 Add a call to action.

Step4 Add personalization to your video.

Step5 Video Length.

### 1\. Start by introducing yourself

You can always start your intro by introducing yourself but don't just state your name and what

you do, tell them why you do it, what your core values are and what motivates and dives you to

do this kind of career. Because you all know doing vlog on YouTube is a job, work, and a career.

Share emotions with your audience, and help them relate to you. Doing so is going to help you stand out immediately from the crowd and get audiences interested enough to watch the remainder of your video's content.

### 2\. Get into details

Tip is always direct to the point, add a few facts about yourself, like your interest or previous experiences or who you are as a person. If you are a business owner and would want to talk about your business you can always share how it started.

If we are talking about the YouTube intro video. Every good YouTube intro video usually includes beneficial information for subscribers and viewers. Add any short important text that you feel is necessary from the video titles, your YouTube channel name, and social media handles. Keep your informative text in a consistent format and branding style.

### 3\. Add a call to action

if you have successfully maintained the interest of your viewer until the very end of your video, use this opportunity to invite them to engage with your content more. It's worth including a call to action in each video. Take a full advantage of YouTube to provide your audience with your social media channels and maybe a link or two to your other videos that might interest them,

### 4\. Add personalization to your video

Even though an intro can be more than logo animation, the latter should still be a part of it. Otherwise, there's a sense that something is messing. Include eye catchy visuals effects to your videos to stands out, so that people can easily remember your YouTube channel.

![personalize youtube intro video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/personalize-youtube-intro-video-filmora.jpg)

### 5\. Video length

A long intro, even if it's spectacular, can get boring once your audience has seen it a few times. An ideal length for intros is up to 8-10 seconds only. Just enough time to deliver your message and branding, and hook audiences in for the rest of the video. Any longer than that, and you might lose viewers who are waiting to see the video that they clicked on.

In the era of social media, tempting distractions and short attention spans, it's critical to keep your content as short and sharp as you can.

## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**.

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

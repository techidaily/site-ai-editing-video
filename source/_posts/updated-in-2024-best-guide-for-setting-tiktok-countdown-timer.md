##### Step1Upload Your Video Clip

![launch filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step1.JPG)

Launch Filmora and add the video clip that contains the track you want to modify for your project.

##### Step2Find the Silence Detection Feature

![find the silence detection feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step2.jpg)

Remember, you will notice the Silence Detection feature in only audio-enabled video clips. Follow the below steps to detect and remove silent gaps from the clip.

* You need to choose the Silence Detection button from the toolbar.
* You will find the video in the Media window. Right-click your media file and choose Silence Detection.
* After selecting the audio or video clip, go to Tools, followed by Audio. You will find the Silence Detection option. The Silence Detection window will appear once you touch this option.

##### Step3Modify the Settings for the Silence Detection Feature

![silence detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step3.JPG)

You may change the threshold or sensitivity to make it work for you. The sensitivity level determines the size of the pause. Thus, a lower sensitivity level records longer pauses. You can fine-tune three crucial Filmora Silence Detection settings in this step.

First, you should adjust the volume threshold to fix a specific value for silence. This parameter tells the algorithm how loud you want it to be before it becomes annoying. By default, 25% is the volume threshold. It implies that the software will consider segments silent if their volume threshold value is less than 25%.

 Now, you should adjust the Minimum Duration option. It tells Filmora how long a period of quiet or low-volume sound should be. Just 0.5 seconds is the default minimum duration. In other words, for 0.5 seconds to be considered quiet, there must be no sound.

 You can also set the Softening Buffer value. This setting allows you to add a little delay before and after audible parts begin and finish. With 0.1s set as the default, the softening buffer starts to work. It implies that the beginning and end of the audible parts may each have their own 0.1-second buffering time.

##### Step4Eliminate Any Found Silences

![choose analyze option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step4.jpg)

Hit the "Analyze" button after you're happy with the settings. The Filmora will detect and remove the silent areas in your audio track.

The software also highlights segments in two different colors. Seen in black are the portions that do not contain any sound. The highlighted sections indicate the audible portions.

##### Step5Evaluate Your Work and Adjust

![evaluate your work and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step5.JPG)

You can make sure the video segments move without a hitch. Thus, listen to the modified audio track again. You can adjust the clips in the timeline to customize the edit directly if necessary.

Of course, you also have the option to tweak the three audio settings listed in step 3\. Next, choose Restart to remove the silent segments from your video.

##### Step6Export Your Video Clip

![export video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step6.jpg)

## Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

![ispring-river-poster.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ispring-river-poster.png)

**Price: $97 for a single lifetime license**

Installing iSpring River on your PC turns it into a PowerPoint add-on that you can use from the ribbon. This isn't a limitation since iSpring River allows you to convert PPT files to widely suitable video file formats like MP4 or AVI, even though it's not stand-alone computer software.

All of the original PowerPoint presentation's animations and audio files, as well as transitions and font and text formatting, will be included in the final film. Video files exported from iSpring River may be uploaded straight to YouTube, but no other social media services such as Dropbox or Google Drive are supported.

##### Pros

It's quick and simple to use.

There isn't any support for high-definition video.

### 4.RZ PowerPoint Converter

![rz-powerpoint-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rz-powerpoint-poster.jpg)

**Price:** _There is a free version available, and prices begin at $29.99._

Using this sophisticated converter, any PPT files made with 2013 or previous versions of PowerPoint may be quickly converted to movies. RZ PowerPoint video to ppt converter also allows you to create HD video files that can be readily shared online, as well as files that can be burnt to DVDs.

Any current video playback device can play videos generated with this program, and the quality is so outstanding that you can play them on huge LCD displays. Though this video to ppt converter is accessible for free, its free edition lacks all of the capabilities that make this program an excellent alternative for professionals that prepare PowerPoint presentations on a consistent basis. It's possible to get the commercial edition of this Windows-based tool and have all of the multimedia you include in the presentations converted to video without losing any quality.

##### Pros

You may use this to burn DVDs.

All PowerPoint file types are supported.

##### Cons

However, basic PPT to video file conversion is only available in the free edition of the product.

There is no possibility to convert many files at once.

### 5.Camtasia Studio

**Price: A free trial is offered, and a single-user license is $249.**

There is much more to Camtasia Studio than simply a video to ppt converter in it. An unencumbered trial edition of this video editing program helps you create professional-looking films from PowerPoint presentations. Camtasia Studio's single-user license is a good alternative for those who just need to convert a few presentations for free, but if you're searching for a full-featured video to ppt converter, you should consider purchasing Camtasia.

When using the software's premium edition, you may add multimedia files, such as PowerPoint presentations and webcam footage to your final video project. With Camtasia Studio, you can easily post your films in nearly any video file type on social media.

##### Pros

With Camtasia Studio, adding transitions, callouts, or text effects is a cinch.

Advanced video editing tools are available.

##### Cons

Only 30 days are included in the free trial.

Expensive.

## Conclusions

When looking for the best PowerPoint conversion software, there are a lot of factors to consider. The output quality, the ability to use PowerPoint effects, compatibility with new devices, & one publishing are all key considerations. Get a free trial of iSpring Converter Pro, the number one choice on our list, if you need a dependable video to ppt converter that can handle any amount of slides and animations in your presentation.

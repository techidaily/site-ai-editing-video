## How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

Step2 The "effects" symbol, which looks like a winking emoji, should be tapped. You will have access to a wide variety of TikTok filters once inside. On your screen, click the Filters symbol in the top right corner.

Step3 The options screen opens when you press the effect filter button. Your effect will appear in your video once you just hit the red button. When you are presented with all of these filters, choose the one that best fits your video and give it a try.

Step4 You may apply the filter to your video after you have officially made your decision. After doing this, leave the filter gallery and begin recording your video. Now that all of these procedures have been completed, you are able to capture your video with the effect on it.

## The Bottom Line

Filters on TikTok work similarly to filters on other social media applications. However, there is no option or function in the TikTok app that allows you to look for a filter effect under the Filters or Effects tab. However, since most TikTok users constantly upload videos with any filter and strive to put the filter's name and hashtags on the films, you may search for some videos with the identical filter. Your films will get flair and individuality thanks to this simple technique, which also gives certain filters a chance to catch on as trends.

Step4To fade in and fade out the audio in the project, click on the gear icon from the options to the left of the screen.

![click gear icon kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-gear-icon-kinemaster.jpg)

Step5Select the “Audio” tab on the next screen and then turn on the switch next to “Audio Fade-in (Start of Project)” and “Audio Fade-out (End of Project).” This will add a fade-in and fade-out effect at the beginning of the audio and at the end of it.

![audio fade effect kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/audio-fade-effect-kinemaster.jpg)

Step6You can then easily set the duration of the “Audio fade-in” and “Audio fade-out” by dragging the slider below each option. We recommend setting the duration to just a few seconds.

Don't forget to save the project when you're done.

## Kinemaster Alternative to Edit Audio

Kinemaster is a good way to edit both audio and video on your computer, but the following options are just as good;

### 1\. VideoShop

VideoShop is a simple to use and highly effective program that you can use to create and edit videos on your computer. The interface makes it easy to import any video project that you have into the program and the wealth of very useful features can help you edit the video in various ways.

For example, you can change the speed of the video, add transitions at various points in the video, add and remove text, add and remove music and so much more. Although there is a free trial version, you will only be able to access some of the more useful features when you purchase the premium version.

The Pro version of VideoShop goes for $3.99 a month, but you can get lifetime access to the program for only $39.99\. One thing that VideoShop has over Kinemaster is that it is very easy to use, even beginner users find video editing a breeze with this tool.

### 2\. Filmora

If you are looking for a simple way to edit videos on Android or iOS devices, Filmora is one of the best options in the market. This mobile version of the very popular [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor is just as easy to use as its parent program. You can use it to create video projects from scratch or upload a video and make changes to it.

It offers you a lot of choices when it comes to editing features including trimming sections of the video, adding filters, adding music, adding or removing text, and even changing the canvas or the background of the video. Advanced options such as changing the speed of the video are also available.

One of the things that we love about Filmora is that you don't even have to create an account to use it or remove the watermark added to the completed video project, watching a video ad can be enough. But this option is only available once every 24 hours, meaning that you can only remove a watermark on the free version once a day. Filmora is available for both iOS and Android and the yearly premium plan will cost you just $19.90.

### 3\. Quik

Quik is a video editing program created by GoPro for the purpose of editing GoPro videos, but that doesn't mean that you will not be able to use it to edit other types of videos. You can use Quik to create a new project or edit an existing video and gives users a lot of different options when it comes to video editing.

One of the main benefits of using Quik is that you can easily add music, audio, and special effects to a video as well as change the length of the video, fade audio in and out and even change when the music starts. It is also one of the best ways to use images to create collages and slideshows very easily. There are a lot of slideshow and collage templates to choose from, and you can edit them easily by adding your music and images. Quik is completely free to use and you can upload your creation to the cloud ad share the link with others.

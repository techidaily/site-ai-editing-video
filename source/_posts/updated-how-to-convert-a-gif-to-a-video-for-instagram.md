## How to Concatenate Videos Using FFmpeg

Video editing is a crucial aspect of creating content for many people. Whether you're a YouTuber, a marketer, or just someone who wants to share videos with friends and family, being able to edit and manipulate your videos is key. One of the most basic video editing tasks is concatenating videos, which combines multiple files to create one cohesive video.

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to do just that, and in this guide, we'll walk you through the process of FFmpeg concatenate videos. Whether a beginner or an experienced video editor, this guide will provide you with all the information you need to seamlessly merge your videos. From installation to execution, we'll cover it all so you can streamline your video editing process.

![concat videos with ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ffmpeg-concat-videos.JPG)

## Overview and Installation of FFmpeg

FFmpeg is free, open-source project that allows you to record, convert, and stream digital audio and video. It is a command-line tool widely used in video editing and transcoding. FFmpeg can be used to concatenate videos and other tasks, such as adding subtitles, changing video resolution, and more. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a versatile and accessible tool for anyone to use.

Here's how to install FFmpeg:

Step1 **Log in** to your Ubuntu server via SSH and **update** the package index.

_$ sudo apt update_

Step2 **Install** FFmpeg and all the required dependencies

_$ sudo apt install ffmpeg_

Step3 **Verify** the version of FFmpeg that you've installed.

_$ ffmpeg -version_

## Prerequisite

Before we merge videos using FFmpeg, we must understand the various methods available to us. FFmpeg offers three ways to concatenate videos: a demuxer, a filter, or a protocol. However, each method has its own set of considerations, and the best method for you will depend on the properties of the videos you're working with.

It's crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you're merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It's essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.

### Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg "concat" demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn't require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the "concat" demuxer and "concat" protocols in FFmpeg.

**Merge Videos With the "Concat" Demuxer**

The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Create** a **.txt file and list** the paths of the video files you want to merge.

_Join\_video.txt_

_file /Users/Video/input1.mp4_

_file /Users/Video/input2.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can add more than two video files.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

![filmora export video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-05.png)

## Conclusion

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to concatenate videos in various ways. Whether you're working with videos of the same codecs and resolutions or videos with multiple audio streams, FFmpeg can handle it. However, for users new to video editing or needing experience with command-line tools, using Filmora can be a more user-friendly option. It offers a simple drag-and-drop interface and a variety of features and effects to enhance the overall look of your video.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

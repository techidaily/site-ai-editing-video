### Requirement 2\. Footage for Intro

When creating content for your YouTube videos, remember that you will also need some footage for your intro. Intros need to be as captivating as possible.

So to hook the audience from the start, you will need an entertaining start. These video clips can be the exciting moments that you cut before the climax or landscapes of the scenery. The choice is yours.

## Part 3\. Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a YouTube Intro

You can create a YouTube intro in two ways.

* Create a YouTube intro with an opener template.
* By using video clips from your library.

To use both of these methods, you will need Wondershare Filmora. For this, read below to get your hands on it!

### Create a YouTube Intro with an opener template

Opener templates are full of fancy graphics and animations that you can change according to your style. The library provides you with the most vibrant and simplest form of opener templates.

##### Step1 Download Wondershare Filmora

* Click on the Title icon above the Import window.
* On the left column, scroll down to **Titles** \> **Openers**.

After previewing the opener, we need to insert it into the timeline. Simply click on an intro you like and place it in the timeline below. Here you can edit the Opener.

##### Step3 Edit The Text

After adding the opener to the timeline, your goal is to type in your text. This text will appear in the intro. To perform this action, follow the steps mentioned below:

* **Double-click** on the opener added to the timeline.
* This will open the settings menu in the import window.
* Type in the text box your channel's or vlog's name.

* Then change the font of text if you want.
* You can also edit the **sub-heading**. Here you can write a short description of your video.
* Once you are done typing the text, click on **OK** to confirm your changes.

After you have typed in the text for your opener, it is time to add some music to it.

##### Step4 Add Music into Clip

Music will spice up your intro video and give more pleasing effect. To proceed it further, follow the following steps:

![wondershare filmora adding music to the intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-youtube-intro-3.png)

This is how you can create an opener intro for your YouTube videos. Choose the graphics that most suit your video's vibe.

Now that we have learned how to make an opener by template, let's look at how to create an intro using clips in your library.

### Create an Intro with Video Clips in Your Library

Wondershare Filmora also allows you to edit your videos to turn them into openers. This will enable your intros to be more personal and unique, giving you the edge of creativity.

Creating an intro by using video clips is an easy task. You just need suitable video clips to use as an intro, and you are good to go.

Follow the steps as mentioned to create an intro using Video clips:

##### Step1 Import the Video Clips

After downloading Wondershare Filmora, your next step is to import your video clips. To perform this, follow the steps as mentioned below:

* On the Filmora Home Interface, find the **Import** icon on the top left side and select it.
* This will direct you to your PC library.
* Select the photos and videos you want to edit and click **OK**.

![selecting video clips from the pc library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-youtube-intro-4.png)

##### Step2 Add The Video Clips to the Timeline

Once you have imported clips in the Import window, your next step is simply to add them to the timeline. For this, follow the steps mentioned below:

* Then, drop them in the timeline.

![wondershare filmora importing video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-youtube-intro-5.png)

Once in the timeline, your video is ready to go into editing mode. But before we insert the template of our intro, we need another step as shown!

##### Step3 Trim The Video Clips

As it's the intro, we need to trim the video clips, so they are concise. You may have recorded longer video clips, but we need clips that are no longer than **5 seconds**.

To trim the video clips, follow the steps mentioned:

* Move the **playhead** on the video clip to where you want to trim.
* Click on the **scissors** icon on the Playhead.

This will split your video clip into two parts. Now, you can delete whatever part you like and keep the other one.

**Note:** To measure the time of the video clip, keep an eye on the **Time map** above the Playhead.

![wondershare filmora trimming the video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-youtube-intro-6.png)

When you have trimmed your video clips to your liking, it's time to add the Title text that will act as an intro to your video!

##### Step4 Add The Title Text

This article will show you how to add camera shake to your videos using Adobe After Effects.

## Why Do We Need To Add A Camera Shake Effect To The Video?

Have you ever tried to add a simple camera shake effect to your videos? You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.

Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you're filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there's lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.

A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you're making a video that's meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that's supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:

* This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.
* Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they've seen similar videos before.
* Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.
* It's a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren't perfect humans, so we can't make perfect videos every time!"
* You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).
* You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer/audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.

## How to add camera shake to video in After Effects

When it comes to video editing, knowing how to make a layer shake in After Effects is a very useful skill. Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.

### Step 1\. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file

Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.

![camera shake effects for premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Step 2\. Press the alt/option key, then click the stopwatch next to "position."

You are adding an "expression" to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.

By pressing the alt/option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside "position" and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.

![use camera shake in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-2.jpg)

### Step 3\. Enter "Wiggle (3,8)" and adjust the settings accordingly

In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle -- basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The "Wiggle (10,3)" command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.

### Step 4\. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition

In order to make the overall effect more "choppy," you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition> Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as "8" if you want a choppy feel.

![how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg)

Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.

## Bonus! Camera Shake Presets for After Effects

In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle -- basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The "Wiggle (10,3)" command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.

### Step 4\. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition

In order to make the overall effect more "choppy," you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition> Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as "8" if you want a choppy feel.

![how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg)

Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.

## Why Do We Need To Add A Camera Shake Effect To The Video?

Have you ever tried to add a simple camera shake effect to your videos? You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.

Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you're filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there's lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.

A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you're making a video that's meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that's supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:

* This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.
* Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they've seen similar videos before.
* Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.
* It's a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren't perfect humans, so we can't make perfect videos every time!"
* You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).
* You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer/audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.

## How to add camera shake to video in After Effects

When it comes to video editing, knowing how to make a layer shake in After Effects is a very useful skill. Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.

### Step 1\. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file

Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.

![camera shake effects for premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Step 2\. Press the alt/option key, then click the stopwatch next to "position."

You are adding an "expression" to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.

By pressing the alt/option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside "position" and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.

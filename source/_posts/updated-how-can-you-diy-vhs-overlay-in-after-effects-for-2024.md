## Part 1：Step by Step DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The retro "VHS Look" has become relatively trendy in recent years. The memories associated with the popular VHS trend has helped the trend make a comeback. Creating this effect in After Effects may seem to be a complicated process if you have not tried it before. But we have made it easier for you to add VHS overlay in Adobe After Effects. Follow the steps to add it in after effects-

Before you begin, download and install VHS preset if you haven't already. Remember that VHS preset only works with After Effects CC 2018 and up. So, make sure you have the recent version of After Effects or the one not older than the 2018 version.

Step 1: To create a VHS look on your video, drop any video of your choice into the project panel and give it a name, let's say, "VCR static overlay". Set the width and height to 1920 and 1080 px, respectively.

![changing composition settings on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-composition-settings-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 2: Right-click on your video and select New Comp from Selection. Drag your video to a new composition and then go to Lumetri Color < Basic Correction. Add some contrast. You can set it to 50 or any other number of your choice. Then bring the white level down to -55.

![getting lumetri color effect to get vhs look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-lumetri-color-effect-to-get-vhs-look.jpg)

Then open the Creative tab. Increase the faded film to 40\. Set sharpening to -70\. Bring vibrance to -30.

Note: Here, I changed the number to get the effect I wanted. You can change the numbers and set the values as per your requirements.

Now, click on the Curves option. Drag down the white curve and then align it with the original curve. Move the green curve up a bit and bring down the blue curve. Then comes the Vignette tab. Open it and set the number to -1.

![changing white green and blue curves on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-white-green-and-blue-curve-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 3: Now, we will give our video a subtle RGB spit appearance. For that, we need to use the Channel Blur effect twice. First, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set red blurriness to 20\. Turn on the repeat edge pixels. Then change the Blur Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to vertical.

![giving rgb split appearance to video with channel blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/giving-rgb-split-appearance-to-video-with-channel-blur.jpg)

Step 4: Again, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set blue blurriness to 30\. Repeat the process of checking the repeat edge pixels box. Change the Blue Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to horizontal.

Step 5: Next comes giving the video artificial sharpening look using Unsharp Mask. So, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Unsharp Mask. Under the Unmask Mask menu, set the amount to 100 and the radius to 10.

![using unsharp mask to give you video sharpening look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-unsharp-mask-to-give-your-video-sharpening-look.jpg)

Step 6: To add a font to your video, simply search VHS font on Google. Look for the one you want to use in your video and download it. To give your video that authentic VHS-style look, we suggest downloading free VCR OSD Mono font and installing the font on your system.

Step 7: Go to Layer < New < Solid and choose any color. We chose white. Now, under Effects & Presets, search for a number. Drag it to the white solid. Choose the font VCR OSD Mono. You can change the number to time or date. You can also add time manually. Select the text tool, go to the source text, hold alt, and click on the stopwatch. Write "timeToCurrentFormat() and time will be displayed on the video. Let us say we want to see the date on the video instead of time. So, change the time to date. Drag the date to the bottom right of the video to give it the look of an old VHS tape.

If you are a beginner and want a simple VHS effect, you can follow these easy steps and create the VHS video that will transport you back to the 90s.

Now we can start adjusting the audio settings. Let's go with the audio levels first.

##### Step4Adjust the audio levels

To adjust the audio levels, look at the left side of the audio mixer. Here you'll see two vertical bars, which are;

* The audio levels for the video clip.
* The audio levels for the sound and music in the music track.

You can adjust the icon up or down to make these channels louder or softer.

##### Step5Adjust the audio channels

See those circles above the audio levels? These are for adjusting the audio channels.

* Rotate the knob-like icon in these circles to adjust the Audio channels' pan/bounce control. This switches the sound between the left and right channels.
* On top of that, you can see these changes on the channel control panel.

![adjust the channels of your audio tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-channels-of-your-audio-tracks.jpg)

Now it's time to select the audio mode.

##### Step6Select the audio mode

The audio mixer of Filmora provides you with two audio mode options. These are;

● **Stereo Mode**

In the Stereo mode, you can pan from left to right and control your audio just like the knob of the audio channel.

● **Surround Mode**

You can pan from left to right and front to back in this mode by rotating the video or music icons. This provides you with complete control over the audio positions. But remember that this mode works best if your video is played with the surround sound system.

![select the mode of your audio tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/select-the-mode-of-your-audio-tracks.jpg)

Once you have changed the audio mode, let's look at the master levels.

##### Step7Adjust the master levels

On the very left of the window, you'll find the Master levels.

This is where you can adjust the master section or all your audio files on your timeline.

* Just drag the master level slider upward and downwards, and you'll notice the changes right away.

One of them has to be Kdenlive video editor that is available free and compatible across all desktop operating systems. The video editor claims to be suitable for beginners as well as for professional video editors.

But is it comparable to premium video editors and is it suitable for standard and advanced video editing? Read our Kdenlive tutorial and review for everything you need to know.

## Part 1\. Key Features of Kdenlive

If you need to edit videos occasionally, a free video editor is what you will be looking for. Unfortunately, most free videos have very basic video editing tools and they are suitable for editing personal videos only. On the contrary, Kdenlive comes with all the standard as well as some advanced video editing features. Here are all the key features of Kdenlive video editor that you should be aware of.

Multi-track editing – Kdenlive comes with a versatile timeline where you can have multiple tracks consisting of video clips, audio files and different effects and objects. You can lock the tracks as well as mute them so that you can experiment as you edit your video.

Effects and Transitions – Even though limited, there are eye-catching effects and transitions available. You can also go for color correction as well as minor adjustments in your audio. Besides, the titler lets you create amazing 2D texts and titles.

Proxy Editing – Kdenlive uses proxy editing technique to lower the resolution of high-resolution videos while you edit them. This takes away the pressure on the CPU resources, but when it renders, the original resolution gets restored back. That is why Kdenlive has been effective in low-end computers as well.

Flexible User Interface – Kdenlive comes with a customizable user interface. This means you can arrange the layouts of your workflow as per your requirements. Besides, there are configurable keyboard shortcuts. There are also different themes available for the user interface.

Keyframing – One of the advanced features of Kdenlive is that you can keyframe any effect. This means you can change the parameters of the effects with time using curves. Besides, the software supports green screen effect.

Miscellaneous – The software supports almost all types of audio and video file formats. There is an option for automatic backup which is highly useful in any video editing software. The software also supports online resources and add-ons.

## Part 4\. Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos

Kdenlive has several drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the best video editor. Even though the features are sufficient for beginners, it is not suitable for professional editing.

## How to Shoot Cinematic Footage From a Smartphone

Creating cinematic videos is easy if you have expensive equipment like a film set with high-quality cameras. But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.

You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don't have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.

But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!

## Part 1\. What Is a Cinematic Video?

The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.

Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., **IMAX** cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.

With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.

Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!

## Part 2\. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video

To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:

### 1\. A Gimbal Stabilizer

When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.

If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.

A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the **Q3** Gimbal from **Zhiyun**.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-1.png)

You can also connect the Gimbal from its app. Scroll below to learn more about the app!

**Zhiyun Cami App**

**Zhiyun Q3** stabilizer also connects with the Zhiyun cami app. This app will allow users to access the filming features more intuitively and comprehensively. You can connect your Gimbal with the app via Bluetooth.

![zhiyun cami app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-2.png)

**Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes**

There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:

* **The Locking mode:** This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.
* **The POV mode** will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.

![the different modes of zhiyun q3 stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-3.png)

**Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer**

When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in **flashlight.**

This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal flashlight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-4.png)

You can also turn the flashlight towards yourself if you are recording a Vlog or taking a selfie. The light’s temperature is 4300K, giving a relatively warm light on the subject.

![spectrum of light indicating 4300k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-5.png)

### 2\. A Good Smartphone

Most smartphones these days are equipped with cameras with varying powers of recording. Some smartphone cameras focus on **Mega Pixels,** while others focus on the capture sensor. You need a smartphone camera that balances out all these qualities to record cinematic footage.

The recently released iPhone 14 pro camera is an excellent example of a good quality camera you can use to record cinematic videos.

![smartphone attached to gimbal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-6.png)

### 3\. Video Editing Software

Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.

## Part 3\. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone

You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.

Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.

* The Reveal Movement.
* The 180° Presentation Movement.
* The Following Movement.

First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.

### 1\. The Reveal Movement

This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.

The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.

To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:

* First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the **Gimbal**.
* **Align** your Smartphone camera behind the static object.
* Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.
* Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.

Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in **Locking mode**. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.

![gimbal fixed in locking mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-9.png)

### 2\. The 180° Presentation Movement

The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.

Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.

As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the **POV** **mode** of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.

![gimbal fixed in pov mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-10.png)

Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:

* First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.
* Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.
* When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.
* When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.

![the 180° presentation movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-11.gif)

By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”

### 3\. The Following Movement

You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.

The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.

![drawing a square to focus the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-12.png)

To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:

* When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.
* After that, open the **Cami** app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.
* Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.

![the following movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-13.gif)

This is how you will create the following movement.

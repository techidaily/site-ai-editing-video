In this article, we'll focus on FFmpeg, a powerful command-line tool that can help you easily merge audio and video.

FFmpeg is open-source software that allows you to convert, edit, and stream multimedia files. It's widely used by professionals and enthusiasts and has many capabilities, including merging audio and video files. This guide will walk you through merging audio and video using FFmpeg.

## Preparation

Are you ready to master the art of merging audio and video? Then let's dive into the world of FFmpeg, a powerful and versatile tool that can help you achieve professional results.

With FFmpeg, you can record, convert, and stream audio and video files in any format, making it a complete and cross-platform solution. It's also a great tool for decoding, encoding, transcoding, muxing, demuxing, streaming, filtering, and playing any media type.

But before we start merging video files using FFmpeg, it's important to understand the basics of container formats and video codecs. These are the building blocks of your videos, and the specific types you're working with will determine the method you'll use to merge them. So, buckle up, and let's get started!

### How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg

Are you looking to add multiple audio tracks to your video? With FFmpeg, you can easily combine video with two audio streams. Whether creating a foreign-language version of your video or adding an alternate audio track, this method will help you achieve professional results. This section will guide you through combining video with two audio streams using FFmpeg's command-line interface. So, let's get started!

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video**

Combining multiple audio tracks into one video can be done easily with FFmpeg's command-line interface. In this example, we will combine two audio tracks into one video so that the voiceover will play over the background music. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step1 **Open** your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your video and audio files are located.

Step2 **Replace** "**video1.mp4**" and "**audio1.mp3**" with the names of your actual video and audio files.

_ffmpeg \\_

_\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

Step3 The **\-c:v copy** flag tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream from the source file without re-encoding it. This helps to speed up the process and avoid quality loss.

_\-c:v copy \\_

_\-filter\_complex " \\_

Step4 The command "**amix=inputs=2:duration=longest**" tells amix to accept 2 inputs (**0:a and 1:a**) and **combine** them into an output stream called **audio\_out**, with the duration of the longest input.

_\[0:a\]\[1:a\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

Step5 **Map** the video stream **(0:v)** and the mixed audio stream **(audio\_out)** into the final output video.

_\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

Step6 The **\-y flag** tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.

_\-y output.mp4_

Once complete, you'll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video Adjusting Volume**

We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.

And here's the step-by-step process:

Step1 **Start** the command by specifying the input files.

_ffmpeg \\_

 _\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** option to specify a filter graph.

 _\-filter\_complex " \\_

 _\[0:a\] volume=0.5 \[music\];_

Step3 **Use** the **amix** filter to take the "**music**" stream and **audio1.mp3** and **mix** them.

 _\[music\]\[1:a\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

 _" \\_

Step4 **Use** the **map** option to **specify** which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.

 _\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

Step5 **Specify** the output file name as "**output.mp4**" and the **\-y flag** to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.

 _\-y output.mp4_

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay**

When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here's how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.

Step1 **Use** the **adelay filter** to add delay to the audio track.

_\[1:a\] adelay=2100|2100 \[voice\];_

Step2 **Mix** the delayed audio track with the original audio track

_\[0:a\]\[voice\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\]_

Step3 **Map** the video and audio tracks to the output file

_\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]"_

Step4 **Use** the **\-y flag** to overwrite the output file

_\-y output.mp4_

The final command would look like this:

_ffmpeg \\_

 _\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

 _\-filter\_complex " \\_

 _\[1:a\] adelay=2100|2100 \[voice\]; \\_

 _\[0:a\]\[voice\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

 _" \\_

 _\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

 _\-y output.mp4_

This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.

## How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

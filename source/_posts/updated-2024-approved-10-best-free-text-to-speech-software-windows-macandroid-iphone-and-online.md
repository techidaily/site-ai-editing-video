Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man's input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.

We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.

Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.

Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.

## Want to Know the Full Process of Adding the Falling Text Effect as a Video Introduction? Detailed Guidelines on All the Steps Are Mentioned Here for Filmora Users

In this context, the fun falling text effect is a unique and exciting approach to making your titles in videos engaging. It creates a fun look when the viewer clicks into the video and is met with this styling title effect.

On [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), there is a feature available for users to apply this effect to videos in a more straightforward sequence of steps than other editors. Yet, knowing how it works is still valid, even for experienced editing professionals. In this post, we shall detail all of the steps that go into creating this effect in videos, with examples.

## Final Words

Indeed, adding the falling text effect should allow you to create a stunning, dynamic, and engaging video project. While the feature is available in many other editing software, you can expect a better user experience on Filmora, especially as a beginner-level user.

The UI on this software is simple to navigate, with all features easily accessible. Besides the falling text customization benefits, you will also use other effects, filters, and title presets in videos with some simple taps. So, install it soon and give it a try.

![need a video clip of your arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-1.jpg)

Step2 After that, put the arm on the tableand keep it still while filming. Meanwhile, have another hand perform on the other side of the frame and pretend to use magic to remove the tattoo.

![put the arm on the tableand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-2.gif)

Step3 Next, you need a picture of a tattoo. Indeed, it would be better to have the tattoo in the same position on the arm so it can match the video clip we just filmed.

![need a picture of a tattoo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-3.jpg)

After preparing everything, you need to go to Filmora 11 and start editing. If you haven't downloaded Filmora already, you can visit filmora.wondershare.com.

## Part 2: Editing Tutorial

Step1 First, drag and drop the arm video clip onto the first video track and the tattoo picture on the second video track.

![drag and drop the arm video clip onto the first video track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-5.jpg)

Step2 Add a mask around the tattoo part from the picture. You must hide the first video track to see the mask clearly.Then, double-click on the picture on the timeline and go to the setting window on the top left. Find the Mask Section and select the circle shape. Now you can see the mask is applied.

Step3 Adjust the position and size of the mask to reveal only the tattoo part. Then you must change the "Blur Strength" to add more blur to the edge of the mask.

![add more blur to the edge of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-7.jpg)

Step4 With the mask finalized,unhide the first video track with the arm video clip. Next, adjust the position and size of the tattoo and make it fit the arm clip.

Step5 Go to do colour correction on the tattoo image so that it matches better with the arm skin. Double-click on the tattoo on the timeline and go to the setting window on the top left. Find the "Color" Section and open the "Tone" menu. First, you have to adjust the brightness first.

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-1.jpg)

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents' voices and customize them.

Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.

Features

* The software allows you to Customize your brand's tone.
* It creates responsive IVR agents.
* Possible to do Advertisement text generation with AI with one click.
* Allows Instant language translation.

Cons

* The user interface could be enhanced.
* \- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.
* From text to video For the first time, turn plain words into a professional-looking video.
* There are more than 60 languages available. We now support over 60 distinct languages.
* There are over 45 AI avatars. Synthesia comes with 40+ avatars right out of the box.
* These are Avatars that are unique to you.

* There is Music available for the background.
* Ability to do your Downloads in MP4

Pricing

Synthesia offers two pricing options.

$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)

Enterprise – Individualized Pricing

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.
* There isn't a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.

Because of its simplicity, Clipchamp is another excellent choice for beginners. To generate a preview, simply select your voice, language, and speed before uploading a script. The AI technology in the tool analyzes the script to identify areas that need to be changed.

Features:

$27.00 per month for Business Platinum.

Clipchamp also offers a limited-featured Free Plan.

Cons:

The fee is relatively costly for anyone looking for a low budget service.

* Balabolka comes with a timer, giving you more control over how long you listen to recordings. Because the application can be operated with hotkeys, you can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent exploring the UI. Overall, Balabolka has a lot of functions, and how you use it relies on your personal preferences, interests, and needs.

Dark One, Exterminator, and Blane, for example, are plainly meant to resemble Darth Vader from Star Wars, Daleks from Doctor Who, and Bane from The Dark Knight Rises, respectively.

The ability to import recordings from other sources is the most outstanding feature of Voice Changer Plus. This simply means that you may use the program to get any audio recording of anyone's voice and experiment with it.

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.
* From text to video For the first time, turn plain words into a professional-looking video.
* There are more than 60 languages available. We now support over 60 distinct languages.
* There are over 45 AI avatars. Synthesia comes with 40+ avatars right out of the box.

Pricing

Synthesia offers two pricing options.

$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)

Enterprise – Individualized Pricing

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.

Final Thoughts

As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.

* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-1.jpg)

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents' voices and customize them.

Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.

Features

* The software allows you to Customize your brand's tone.
* It creates responsive IVR agents.
* Possible to do Advertisement text generation with AI with one click.
* Allows Instant language translation.

Cons

* The user interface could be enhanced.
* \- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.

Pricing

Synthesia offers two pricing options.

$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)

Enterprise – Individualized Pricing

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.
* There isn't a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.

Because the application can be operated with hotkeys, you can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent exploring the UI.

## How to Make a Countdown Video

Have you ever wanted to use Adobe After Effects to recreate a countdown timer for a rocket launch or simply create a suspenseful moment in a video by displaying how the time runs out? This tutorial will show you how. It is imperative that you become familiar with the process of creating a countdown in After Effects.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to use Adobe After Effects to put together a countdown video. This procedure is a straightforward one, and it will handle expressions as well as plugins. Stay here and read on to find out more about the various methods in which we might accomplish this goal!

Let's begin!

## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

![create new text countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-new-text-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

![customize timecode countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-timecode-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.

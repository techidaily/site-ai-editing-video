Step 1

The first thing you want to do is download the [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Hit Install and allow the application to start automatically.

Step 2

Once the program loads, head straight over to the **Titles** tab and drag the Basic Title to Track 3 on the Timeline.

Now, take a snapshot of the new Title that you just created.

![make snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-snapshot-in-filmora.png)

Step 5

Next, we’re going to need a few more snapshots. But this time, double-click on the Title again and change its color to whichever one you like. Once you’ve changed its color, go ahead and click the same button as in Step 4 to take another snapshot.

![change text color in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-text-color-in-filmora.png)

Step 6

Next, double-click on the Title once again and go to **“ADVANCED”.** From there, go to **Add Shape** and select the **Rectangle** shape.

![add shape to text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-shape-to-text.png)

Step 7

Look to the left side panel and switch **OFF** the **Text Fill** button. Then, scroll down to the bottom and change the **Shape Fill** color to White.

![change shape fill color filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-shape-fill-color-filmora.png)

Step 8

Now, adjust the rectangle’s shape to a thin line, rotate it, and move it into position like in the image.

![adjust shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adjust-shape.png)

Step 9

Delete the text layer from the Advanced panel.

![delete text layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/delete-text-layer.png)

Step 10

The final step in the Advanced panel is to go to the **Animation** tab from the left side panel and select the **Round Zoom Out** animation preset. Then, click **OK.**

![round zoom out animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/round-zoom-out-animation.png)

Step 11

Now, it’s time to align the clips in the Timeline. First, move your Default Title clip 5 frames further. Then, drag the first snapshot to Track one and move it 8 frames forward.

![align clips in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/align-clips-in-filmora.png)

Step 12

Go to **Sample Color** and drag the Black color to Track 3 in the Timeline. Align it directly on top of where the clip in Track 1 starts. Then, double-click on the black color clip and align it like in the image here.

![align clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/align-clip.png)

Step 13

Now, place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip in Track 1\. Then, double-click the snapshot clip in Track 1\. Now, start increasing the value of the X-axis until it makes the text disappear, just as in this image here.

![edit snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-snapshot-in-filmora.png)

Step 14

Next, move the Playhead 10 frames further. Then, reset the position values by clicking on this button.

![reset position values](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reset-position-values.png)

Step 15

Now, move the Playhead once more and set it at 3 seconds and 10 frames. Then, click on the “+**Add”** button to add another keyframe.

![add keyframe in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-keyframe-in-filmora.png)

Step 16

Move the Playhead to the end of the snapshot clip and set the value of the X axis to 391\. Then, reduce the opacity to 0%. Move the Playhead at the start of the snapshot clip and reduce the opacity to 0% there as well.

![change opacity in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-opacity-in-filmora.png)

Step 17

Next, **Export** the clip to your PC. Just hit the Export button near the top-center of the screen. Then, select all of your clips in the Timeline and move them one track above. Then, drag the second snapshot you took earlier to Track 1.

![drag snapshot to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-snapshot-to-timeline.png)

Now, hide the clip on Track 2 by pressing this button next to it.

![hide clip in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/hide-clip-in-filmora.png)

Step 20

Click on the second snapshot clip located in Track 1\. Then, repeat the process of adding keyframes just like we did with the first snapshot. Review the previous steps to get this right. This time, **remember** to slide the X axis to the **LEFT** instead of RIGHT. Just drag the values to the left.

Step 21

Export this. Then, delete all the clips in the Timeline. Now, import both clips you exported earlier during these steps. Also, import a background video that you’d like to appear behind your slide masking text effect.

Step 22

Next, drag the clips to Timeline and adjust each of them to be the same length. Four seconds is a good option.

Step 23

Double-click on the first clip (not the background clip). Go to **Video** and under **Blending Mode** select **Lighten.**

![blending mode filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/blending-mode-filmora.png)

Step 25

Set the Playhead on frame three and drop the **Motion Shape** element from the Elements tab on Track 4.

![motion shape element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/motion-shape-element.png)

Now, place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip in Track 1\. Then, double-click the snapshot clip in Track 1\. Now, start increasing the value of the X-axis until it makes the text disappear, just as in this image here.

![edit snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-snapshot-in-filmora.png)

Step 14

Next, move the Playhead 10 frames further. Then, reset the position values by clicking on this button.

![reset position values](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reset-position-values.png)

Step 15

Now, move the Playhead once more and set it at 3 seconds and 10 frames. Then, click on the “+**Add”** button to add another keyframe.

![add keyframe in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-keyframe-in-filmora.png)

Step 16

Move the Playhead to the end of the snapshot clip and set the value of the X axis to 391\. Then, reduce the opacity to 0%. Move the Playhead at the start of the snapshot clip and reduce the opacity to 0% there as well.

![change opacity in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-opacity-in-filmora.png)

Step 17

Next, **Export** the clip to your PC. Just hit the Export button near the top-center of the screen. Then, select all of your clips in the Timeline and move them one track above. Then, drag the second snapshot you took earlier to Track 1.

![drag snapshot to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-snapshot-to-timeline.png)

Step 18

![move position of clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/move-position-of-clip.png)

Step 19

Now, hide the clip on Track 2 by pressing this button next to it.

![hide clip in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/hide-clip-in-filmora.png)

Step 20

Click on the second snapshot clip located in Track 1\. Then, repeat the process of adding keyframes just like we did with the first snapshot. Review the previous steps to get this right. This time, **remember** to slide the X axis to the **LEFT** instead of RIGHT. Just drag the values to the left.

Step 21

Export this. Then, delete all the clips in the Timeline. Now, import both clips you exported earlier during these steps. Also, import a background video that you’d like to appear behind your slide masking text effect.

Step 22

Next, drag the clips to Timeline and adjust each of them to be the same length. Four seconds is a good option.

Step 23

Double-click on the first clip (not the background clip). Go to **Video** and under **Blending Mode** select **Lighten.**

![blending mode filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/blending-mode-filmora.png)

Step 24

Drop your second clip to Track three and repeat the same edits for it.

Step 25

Set the Playhead on frame three and drop the **Motion Shape** element from the Elements tab on Track 4.

![motion shape element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/motion-shape-element.png)

## Part 2: How to Edit Time-Lapse Video on a Computer

There are a few things to keep in mind when creating a time-lapse video on a computer. First, make sure the video resolution is high enough to create a good image. Second, make sure the video is smooth and free from any choppy or jittery movements. Finally, make sure the video is timed correctly so that the scenes move in smooth, chronological order.

**Here's how you can make a time-lapse video on your computer:**

Step1 Install a program like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. These programs allow you to set up scenes and transitions in advance so that when you start filming, everything is ready to go.

Step2 Get started by choosing a period and location this will help you decide what kind of scenery will make sense for your scene. The longer the period, the more important it is to pick one that has a lot of natural light. If there are no natural light sources available, consider shooting on an overcast day or at night instead.

Step3 Next, choose what type of camera angle works best for showing off your subject matter; this could be static shots or moving ones that mimic motion through time or space. Also, consider how far away from your subject matter you want viewers to see them from before deciding on which angle works best for showing both sides equally well without making either side too large.

### Benefits of editing time-lapse on computer

Time-lapse videos are a great way to capture incredible footage of your life with minimal effort. You can set the speed of your camera, and then sit back and watch as it moves through time in real-time.

1) You can play with the speed of the camera to get just the right look. You might find that you want it to go faster or slower, or even stop altogether so that you can get a good shot of something specific in your life (like the chirping of birds or water droplets).

2) Editing time-lapses on your computer allows you to zoom in and out at will you don't have to worry about adjusting the zoom on your camera when you're filming something out of frame, which means less work for you!

3) Time-lapses are great for making movies that go from beginning to end you can make one movie that shows how you spend each day from sunrise until sunset or one where every hour is its scene. This way, people who watch your videos will see exactly what they need without having to listen over and over again about all things related to everyday life (which would be boring!).

## Easy Way to Add Transitions to Videos

Editing a video is equally important as recording a video. A raw video footage is never appealing to the eyes because of sudden cuts, unnecessary parts, and lack of eye-catching effects. That is why video editing is crucial for turning an unappealing raw video into an attention-grabbing video. As a matter of fact, the way you edit your video makes your video stand out when you are posting on social media platforms.

One of the most important aspects of video editing is adding transitions to video clips. When you jump from one scene to another and make sudden cuts, you need to apply some video transitions so that the move from one scene to another becomes soothing to the eyes. Different video editors have different transition effects and [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has the best collection of transitions. We will illustrate how to add transition in Filmora and how to improve your video with video transitions.

## Part 1\. What is a Video transition effect?

A video transition effect is the most commonly used graphical effect in video editing. A video transition effect is essential whereby you connect one shot to another, especially when you are making sudden cuts in the video. Therefore, a video transition effect sits in between two shots and connects them together smoothly so that it does not look odd to the eyes. Video editing with transitions is a common practice for short videos on social media, presentation videos, and even movies.

A video transition effect is effective when you are jumping from two moods and emotions in the video. It is equally useful while jumping between storylines, points of view, and timelines. Besides, you can spice up your narrative and make your video eye-catching as well as eye-soothing. There are different types of video transition effects such as fade in and out, zoom in and out, dissolve, wipe and pan.

## Part 2\. How to add transitions in video?

To add transitions to your video, you will need a video editor. You should choose a video editor that has a wide collection of transition effects so that you can apply them to your video as per your preference. If you are someone who regularly makes videos and edits them, a variety of transitions will make the videos look different.

## Part 3\. Video transitions tips and tricks

If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.

**Consistency** – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.

**Experiment** – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.

**Out of the Box** – The reason you recommended [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.

**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.

**Meaningful** – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood. Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.

## The Bottom Line

Video transition effects are essential in almost all types of videos. They enhance the video content and make the transition between scenes smoother. You should choose your video editor wisely so that you can avail different types of video transition effects.

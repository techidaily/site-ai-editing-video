Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video.

1. B-roll

B-roll is secondary video that is frequently used as cutaway video to add context and visual interest to your story. The term is originated from the early days of Hollywood when there used to be an A-roll which was the primary video and B-roll which served as a secondary video footage. This can help you visualize your video from different dimensions, giving it a more realistic look for captivating viewers.

1. Compression rate, bit depth, bit

The amount of data the camera records each second is referred to as bit rate. Every single second of a video is subject to significant data processing by cameras. The higher the quality of the video, the more is the bit rate. Bit depth refers to the number of colors your camera can read per pixel. Common bit depths are 8-bit and 10-bit, which enable a camera to read 256 million or 1.07 billion colors respectively. To upload your edited video, a compression is usually required to convert your resolution to internet quality so that the upload can be made simpler, without distorting the video resolution.

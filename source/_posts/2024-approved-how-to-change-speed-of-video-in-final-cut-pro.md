## How To Change Speed of Video in Final Cut Pro?

When there are certain boring but necessary parts in your video, you need to speed them up. Similarly, you may need to reduce the duration of the entire video. Speeding up the video is your only option when you do not want to cut any part. You must have also observed that certain videos look funny when you speed them up. To speed up videos, you will need a video editor that does not degrade the video quality.

Final Cut Pro is a popular choice to speed up video without distorting the pitch. Many think that the video quality can degrade when they change the speed of the video clip. This concern can be taken care of when you alter the video speed with Final Cut Pro. Instead of changing the speed of the entire video, you can change the speed of specific parts. We will illustrate how to speed up the video using Final Cut Pro and suggest a better choice than FCP.

## Part I. Speed Up Video using Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro by Apple is one of Mac users' most popular video editors. Many video creators purchase MacBooks for editing their videos in Final Cut Pro. The video editor is suitable for beginners as well as professionals. FCP, as a video editor, is super fast in rendering and processing video while exporting. Here are the steps for the Final Cut Pro speed-up clip.

Step1 Open FCP. Navigate to File>New> and tap Project to start a new project.

## Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro

You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.

**Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -**

By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video's speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.

**Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -**

You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project's frame rate.

You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.

![speed up automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

**Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -**

Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.

The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.

## Part III. The Right Final Cut Pro Alternative for Changing Speed - Filmora

While Final Cut Pro offers 2X to 20X speed options, Filmora has 2X to 100X speed presets. Here are the steps to speed up video by choosing a preset speed option.

Step1 Download, install and simply Launch Filmora. Tap Create New Project option.

![install and simply launch filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-8.jpg)

Step2 Go to File> Import Media> Import Media Files and choose the video file. The selected video will be imported into the Project Media folder. Alternatively, you can also use the drag/drop function.

Step3 Adjust the speed slider to set the desired speed as per your requirements. The duration will change as per the speed you set, and you can set the duration below the speed slider. Just like Final Cut Pro, you can turn on Ripple and Audio Pitch as per your preference.

## What Is the Best FPS for YouTube Videos?

YouTube has become one of the to go to social media platforms for internet use because it provides entertainment for people who want to get entertained, learn or catch up with their favorite personalities. This platform has also given content creators a space to showcase their talents, educate the masses or simply have a good time when playing their games.

However, being a content creator on YouTube entails more than just posting a video weekly. You ought to ensure you get the frame rate in the video right. Failure to choose the correct frame rate will affect how your audience enjoys the video, increasing the chances that you lose subscribers.

Without further ado, let's discuss the best fps for YouTube.

![best fps for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-fps.JPG)

## How Does FPS Affect Viewing YouTube Videos?

Before we dive into how FPS affects your viewing experience on YouTube and determine the best frame rate for YouTube, let's define what it is. FPS is short for frames per second and is the number of still images appearing on display in one second. The more frames per second you have in your video, the clearer your video will become. The vice versa is also true.

To further simplify this definition, we will use the example of a flipbook. An animator usually draws an image on each page of the book. When they flip the pages in rapid succession, the images appear to be in motion. Suppose the animator used fewer pages to make their flipbook.

![flipbook animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flipbook.gif)

The animation would not be as smooth and crisp as if they had used more pages, each with a different still image contributing to the final motion.

The human brain can easily differentiate between 12 distinct images. However, when the photos exceed 18 and move rapidly, the brain is tricked into believing that the pictures are in motion. A frame rate lower than 24FPS will make your YouTube video look choppy and unnatural, as if it lags in real time.

Ideally, 24fps is the best fps for YouTube videos featuring mundane activities that we see in daily life. However, if you want to pack more information into your video and make the motion a bit smoother, then 30fps is the best video frame rate for YouTube.

Perhaps you post fast-paced content about gaming and other live-action videos. You are better off choosing 60FPS, which makes high-speed scenes look more fluid and helps you capture double the information.

## What Is the Recommended & Highest Frame Rate for YouTube Videos?

Unfortunately, there is no correct answer when it comes to the best video frame rate for YouTube videos. The controversy still continues, and everyone seems to have their own opinion.

According to [Thomas Edison](https://techland.time.com/2012/12/06/riddles-in-the-dark-the-hobbits-48-frames-per-second-explained/), anything less than 46FPS for motion pictures will strain the eyes and give an unpleasant viewing experience. At the time, filmmakers and videographers were adamant about sticking to between 22-26PFS for their videos, provided the audio adaptability remained at 35mm.

Different frame rates are used for various displays, genres, and mediums. For instance, 1-16FPS was common in silent-era movies and stop-motion movies. However, this frame rate is neither universally accepted nor widespread in the world today.

![recommended frame rate for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recommended-youtube-video-frame-rate.JPG)

An excellent example of a frame rate that produces larger-than-life videos with exceptional detail is 24fps. However, the NTSC confirms that it is, in fact, 23.97 frames per second when you consider issues to do with color and hue.

Another universally acceptable frame rate is 30fps, which is widespread in television. Videographers also use it to make slow-motion segments in sports videos or other fast-paced content. The sweet 60fps makes any motion look smooth as butter and significantly reduces any blur in your videos. This frame rate is also characterized by super fine details you can easily miss with 24 and 30fps. It is also the highest fps video on YouTube.

120fps is synonymous with grandeur, with its monumental footage suitable for slow-motion scenes. Lastly, anything above 120fps works great with ultra-slow-motion videos. Of course, we are talking 240fps, which is rare but not uncommon. However, you would need a high-speed capture camera, which we believe doesn't come cheap.

To sum it all up, 24fps is the recommended frame rate for YouTube. You can go higher than the baseline and use 30fps or higher if you make videos with lots of motion, like gaming videos. Most of the time, a higher frame rate is a personal choice rather than a necessity. However, we understand you want to give your viewers a pleasant experience while watching your content.

## What Is the Best Frame Rate for YouTube Videos?

If you want to record a video for your YouTube channel, you might wonder what is the best fps for YouTube videos. You are better off sticking between 24fps and 60fps. The platform has only recently added 8K support for videos, which is a plus for many content creators. Below is a list of frame rates for the most popular genres on YouTube.

![frame rate for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-frame-rate.jpg)

* Podcasts and talk shows - 30 FPS
* Gaming videos - 60 FPS
* Makeup tutorials - 60 FPS
* Educational videos - 24- 30 FPS
* Health and fitness - 24-30 FPS
* Sports - 40-60 FPS

Remember that the list above is not exhaustive and doesn't cover all types of content on the platform. We can't also guarantee that there is a "best" frame rate for your YouTube video. We suggest you heed our suggestion and practice to determine the best frame rate for YouTube videos.

We couldn't fail to mention that your frame rate should match the content uploading and decoding. Since the interlaced content may experience performance issues on YouTube, it would help if you deinterlaced it.

## How To Check FPS on YouTube Video?

Below is a simple guide on how to check fps on YouTube videos.

Step1 Open any video on YouTube and right-click on it. A pop-up window will appear. Select "Stats for nerds."

![stats for nerds in youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-stats-for-nerds.jpg)

Step2 Narrow down on the "Current/Optimal Res" tab. The first set of figures before the forward slash represents the current resolution, while the figures after the forward slash represent the optimal resolution for the video. For instance, the figure in the picture below indicates that the resolution is 1280\*720, and the frame rate is 30FPS. The figures repeat themselves, meaning that the video is at the optimal resolution.

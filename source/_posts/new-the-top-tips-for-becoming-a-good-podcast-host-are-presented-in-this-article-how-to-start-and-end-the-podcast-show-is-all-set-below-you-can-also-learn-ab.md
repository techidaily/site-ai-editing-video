## The Top Tips for Becoming a Good Podcast Host Are Presented in This Article. How to Start and End the Podcast Show Is All Set Below. You Can Also Learn About the Ways to Call Guests to Your Show

You may be a blogger who has the habit of writing long articles. Or you may be a YouTuber with a hi-fi channel with many subscribers, but a podcast is a different thing in general.

This article will look at how to prepare, call guests, warm them up, and give practical ideas about how to host a podcast. Let's start the article by learning how to get prepared to host a podcast.

## #1 Get prepared to host a podcast

A good podcast host always gets prepared, sets up his goals, and gets easy tips to set apart from everyone in the marketplace. For this, you have to follow the below instructions and tips:

### 1\. A proper pre-interview process

Before starting the podcast, the host should have quality and organic content. The content is related to the guest or any foremost personality related to the topic.

The host should be confident and relaxed to kill the anxiety process. If the host has low confidence, he may suffer from nervousness. This will kill the authenticity.

### 2\. Share questions with the audience

A good understanding of how to pan out a situation makes you a good host. You must share the question on and off during podcasts to build engaging criteria with the audience.

You don't need to sound the script on the screen like a robot. Scripts can be helpful but only if read in a conversational mood.

### 3\. Find the right location

A good location means good conversation. A proper set prepared for the guest and the podcast will help you boost your conversation skills and get yourself and the guest into the mood of your show.

Before the show, you can change the settings or have a monotone set that fits every mood.

## #2 Warm up the audience

**Warming up** is a necessary part of the show. A warmup works just like gas in a car before a long drive. You have to do this by asking any question or by telling them an inspirational or motivational story.

A good host must realize that a warm show has a high chance of becoming viral, and you won't get that if the guest is nervous, tired, or not in the mood.

### Tip 1\. Setting the mood

Your goal is to set the mood of the audience according to the topic. Warming up the audience before getting to the guest.

You have to set the tone according to the topic of your podcast to warm them up. In this way, you need to make the connection between the guest, you, and your voice.

### Tip 2\. Build an emotional connection

Building an emotional connection helps to engage the audience till the end of the show. To make this possible, you can share a funny story with them or about a recent event or any recent incident.

### Tip 3\. Polls and questionnaires

Modern media has connected everything through the internet. You need to interact with the audience by asking questions from them and giving them a chance to answer them by live calling or on social media.

You can also do this on Instagram polls or by posting a story and asking them to select an upcoming topic for the podcast. Introducing this concept will boost your podcast views and help you engage more followers on your other social media platforms.

## #3 Try to be authenticity

You need to have authenticity if you want your podcast to be successful. An authentic show attracts a larger audience, while a show whose mood resembles a person with a multiple personality disorder will throw off the whole vibe of the podcast. And the listeners will eventually press back buttons to escape the colossal wreck.

### Tips to have authentic content

* Your topic may be emotional, happy, or of any other information.
* A good host needs to have the skills of a good actor to convey the emotions that the audience will perceive more efficiently.
* An idea of how the audience will perceive you and how to make your voice tone with emotions on podcasts.
* Don't go for a more serious tone.

**Things to Avoid**

* What you should opt away from is, **faking**
* Don't try to get **excited** about something that you're not.
* Do not pretend to **care** about something when you do not.
* The fakeness will only result in the downfall of your podcast, as the listeners will eventually grow tired and leave.
* You must act well and sell yourself more efficiently to develop that trust with the audience.

The more the audience trusts you, the more authentic you seem.

## #4 Storytelling

Tales are as old as time. As time moves on, more and more stories pile up. Your podcast has the potential to be the best if you know how to utilize those storytelling skills of yours. **It's never about information alone!**

You may have a bland topic to discuss or a guest who is tough to break character. These are the situations where your charm and concern will play their part. So you also want to learn how to make your podcasts enjoyable through stories? Then check out the short tips below:

### How to add stories to your podcasts

* First, you should have the skill to **read** the room and the mood.
* If you start telling a story about **yourself** that has no relation to the topic whatsoever will only lead to the guest being annoyed.
* You may have **called** the **guest** for a reason. This reason should tally with your topic as it will make you ask about their experience.
* Asking the right questions is important.
* You'd better not begin with leading statements such as, **"Obi-wan Kenobi is a good TV show."** the guest may simply reply, **"I do not care."**
* You should approach with question statements such as, **"Did you know that your son is a big fan of the Obi-wan Kenobi TV show."** These are **indulging** questions to help your audience be more involved in your podcasts.

The audience and the guest will also develop an interest in the conversation that will lead to a successful show for the day.

## #5 Transcribe your episodes

A good podcast also looks to give you quality content for each episode. You may call on guests upon guests and promote your podcasts in many ways. One of the ways you can also allow your podcasts to be recognized more is by the use of transcribing.

### What is transcribing?

Transcribing means converting the speech in the audio of your podcasts to a text format. Your podcast may raise some eyes if the content is desirable to the audience.

It may happen your podcast gets around a person whose brother suffers from hearing loss. By a transcription, you offer a chance to let them involved in your podcast. You can accomplish this feat in one of two ways.

* Either use an AI-powered audio editing program, like Wondershare [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), to get you through the speech-to-text transcription by default or a more auto way.
* Convert your text into audio, but this article will not look at it.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Our main focus would be manually converting speech to text using a human transcriber. And we will be doing so by using the Wondershare Filmora app.

### Transcribing podcasts with Wondershare Filmora

Filmora is an all-in-one video editing tool. In the following steps, we will learn the step-by-step process of transcribing podcast by using Wondershare Filmora.

##### Step1Add audio files or footage

* First of all, drag the imported audio files or footage into the timeline.

![adding footage into the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-footage-into-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step2Add subtitles

To show the transcription of the podcast's audio, you have to add sbtitles for better understanding. For this, perform these steps:

* Select the tile icon on the bar above.
* In the window that pops up, select your favorite subtitle format.

![adding subtitle tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-subtitle-tile.jpg)

##### Step3Adjust the size

* Then adjust the size of the video.

![sizing the subtitle tile with the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/sizing-the-subtitle-tile-with-the-video-clip.jpg)

![typing in the speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/typing-in-the-speech.jpg)

In this way, you have created speech-to-text using a human transcriber rather than an AI. Doing this will ensure no mistakes are recorded and make it even more efficient.

## #6 Put yourself in audiences' shoes

And if you feel like the general audience would want to make sense of a particular statement, ask the guest about it. This is what differentiates a good host from a bad one! A general understanding of the audience's point of view would always allow you to process your podcast accordingly.

* You should understand the general sentiments of the audience.
* When you feel a particular subject will attract more audience, do the process accordingly.
* Maybe they like how you process a story and evaluate it. Do that!

All qualities of a good podcast are there, and it's your job to identify them and make the most of them.

## #7 Understand why the guest is here

You are the host of the podcast. Your job is to be sincere with the guest. Moreover, useful information or a valued thought might be a reason why the guest has come to your show. Understand that reason and try to make the most of it.

* The guest might have **heard** about your podcast, or they could be a **constant**
* Your approach to the guest should **tally** with the topic of the podcast.
* The guest might be going through a tough time that makes them a **suitable guest** for that particular episode.
* Or it could be that your podcast attracted them, and now they want to use your interview to promote a book or any other service they think is best.
* As a host, you should allow the guest to have some **control** over the podcast.
* Develop a **sense of trust** between the host and the guest.
* The more you allow the guest to speak freely about themselves, the more they will feel interested in your podcast.

Your goal should be to captivate the guest as much as you can. If the guest is entertained, the more chances are that they will recommend you to other guests. **An experience gone wrong will be bad for the podcast.**

## #8 Invite the right guest

A podcast can be an excellent tool for attracting the audience to your content. And as podcast hosts guests, your first step is finding the right guests for your audience.

Is it necessary to search for a host before calling? Yes! It's quite a complicated and sensitive step to call out guests. A guest is the only one who can make or break the Podcast show. It's important to study the nature of guests too. Because a guest is also considered as a co-host of the show.

If a guest is bored and doesn't take much interest, then there are 100% chance that the show will fail. To find who is more compatible, we have to take assistance from a tool.

You can do this by plugging your podcast into a tool like **Sparktoro**. Sparktoro allows you to see what your audience is engaging with. It could be other platforms of podcasts such as youtube or other social media platforms.

**For example,** If we search for "the art of product podcast" on the Sparktoro website. It will direct us to demographic data, providing information about the content the audience is interacting with.

* It will show **different hashtags** and **frequently used phrases**.

![sparktoro search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/sparktoro-search.jpg)

* Here you can see the top words in bios, hashtags, and frequent phrases.
* On the left window, you can search for other related podcasts your viewers are watching.

![sparktoro search for similar podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/sparktoro-search-for-similar-podcasts.jpg)

* Similarly, you can also use the YouTube option to look at what kind of content your audience watches on youtube.

Following the above methods could give you **50-100** potential clients. Your main goal will be creating a list allowing you to call guests on your show. You can divide the list according to the priorities.

* **Close friends:** the ones who are going to be available whenever you call upon them.
* **The probable list:** the ones who would most probably agree to come on your podcast.
* **The premium list:** these guests will resemble a dream list of guests you want to call on your podcast.

Start by writing emails and promoting content that will attract these guests. Your chances are increased by how much you polish your podcast into creating **premium content**. The more premium the content is, the more premium your chances are of inviting those dream guests.

## What’s an AV1 Format and How Does It Impact Your Life?

Have you heard about the **AV1 format video**? This format is a new compression standard that promises to improve video quality while reducing file size. If you frequently stream video, the **AV1 files** could make an impact on your life, and we are just beginning to see its potential. Let's take a further look at what AV1 is and what you need to know about this new video codec.

![av1 logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Where does it come from?

AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) is a new video compression format that is being developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). AOMedia is a consortium of major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon. The AV1 codec is an improvement on VP9 in several ways, most notably in its ability to compress video more efficiently.

Although the AV1 codec is still in the early stages of development, it is already being adopted by some major tech companies. Netflix has announced that it will start using AV1 for its streaming service, and Google has said that AV1 will be the default codec for YouTube.

### How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?

![watching netflix on tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-2.jpg)

**The importance of codecs**

A codec is a device that encodes and decodes digital audio signals. Without a codec, your audio would sound garbled and distorted. There are two metrics to take into account to judge the performance of video codecs: quality and bitrate.

### The benefits of the new codec

Two of the most popular video formats, provide high-quality video at a relatively low bit rate.

The new AV1 codec offers several benefits for streaming platforms and their users. Take a look at a few of them:

1. **Lower bitrate**
1. **Reduced costs for encoding**

For streaming platforms, AV1 could lead to reducing costs for encoding as well as increasing quality and compatibility. For users, AV1 could improve streaming quality, especially on mobile devices.

1. **Smaller size with better quality**

**AV1 files** will take up less space on your hard drive or be smaller in file size when streamed online. Since AV1 can compress video files to a much smaller size without sacrificing quality, users will be able to save data when streaming video on their devices!

1. **More efficient**

AV1 will use less processing power to decode a video compared to other video codecs. As a result, the streaming platforms can save on bandwidth costs, which can be passed on to users in the form of lower subscription prices eventually.

1. **Royalty-free**

The ultimate goal of AOMedia is to develop an open and royalty-free video codec that can be used by anyone. So, you will have better video quality, lower bandwidth costs, and faster loading times.

AV1 is just one of the many new technologies that are revolutionizing online media delivery. With its superior quality and efficiency, AV1 is poised to become the standard codec for online video in the years to come where everyone can access more affordable and high-quality videos.

## Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?

As we have already discussed, AV1 is a newer codec that promises better compression. This video format has already been widely used and gaining traction in the streaming industry. It is being used more for live broadcasts and other time-sensitive applications.

#### Who will prevail?

![video editing program on a computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-3.jpg)

Since both codecs have their pros and cons, it's unclear which one will ultimately prevail. However, as the world moves towards more open standards for video codecs, there is growing concern that AV1 codec will be used to monopolize the market. While AV1 is free to use, it is encumbered by patents held by members of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), which includes companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

### How would AV1 monopolize the market?

![a pile of us dollars](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-4.jpg)

The EU Commissions' questionnaire, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-eu-antitrust-regulators-probing-tech-group-aoms-video-licensing-policy-2022-07-07/), unveiled that the alliance and its members had been requiring companies to cross-license their patents for no charge to receive the AV1 format. These companies had no affiliation with AOM when AV1 was originally devised. This was a non-negotiable requisite for companies who owned patents that were necessary to contribute to the AV1 standard's technical specifications.

As a result, this action is concerned to hinder innovation and thus prevents the new entities feasible to flourish. Therefore, there is a growing movement to antitrust AV1 which has been investigated by the European Commission.

### What happened after the AV1 Antitrust Investigation

![google logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-5.jpg)

The European Commission is looking into whether this licensing scheme violates antitrust law and whether the companies involved are colluding to keep AV1 closed off to competitors. The investigation is in its early stages, and no formal charges have been filed against Google at this time.

However, if the Commission finds that Google has indeed abused its market position, it could order Google to make changes to AV1 or face steep fines. Although the fines have yet to be determined, each company involved could ultimately pay up to 10% of their global turnover.

Nonetheless, this issue has shed light on the competitive landscape of the codec market. Well, although the outcome of the antitrust investigation is still uncertain, it is clear that it has the potential to shake up the codec market.

## Part 3: What Should You Expect in the Future?

### H.266 codec

![h.266 vvc logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-6.jpg)

H.266 is the next-generation video codec that is being developed to improve upon the current standard and the latest advances in video technology. We can expect H.266 to continue to evolve and be improved upon as time goes on. Some of their transcendence that you can look forward to:

* **Improve compression efficiency**

H.266/VVC is designed to improve compression efficiency by 20-50% over previous versions. You can have a video of the same file size and bit rate but make it look significantly better.

* **Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP) usage**

The H.266 codec uses a new type of inter-frame prediction called Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP). ILP allows the codec to exploit the correlations between different layers of a video signal. Therefore, it gives better results on image quality and file size when you encode a video with the H.266 codec.

* **Higher-quality video**

We can expect higher-quality video content to become more widespread. This new codec will also enable new types of content, such as virtual reality and 360-degree video, to be streamed and enjoyed by a wider audience.

### AV2 codec

The AV2 codec is an improvement on the current AV1\. The AV2 codec is said to be more efficient and have better quality than the AV1 codec. It is still in development and is not yet available for use.

Since this codec is expected to provide better quality video at lower bit rates than other codecs, it would be ideal for use in video applications such as streaming and video conferencing. So, what can we expect from the AV2 codec in the future? Here are a few things to look out for:

* Improved quality at lower bitrates
* Wider adoption in streaming and conferencing applications
* Continued development and improvement

## FAQs: To cater to people also ask

### 1\. How do I open an AV1 file?

AV1 is a relatively new file format. If you have an AV1 file that you need to open, you can use one of the following methods:

* Use a media player that supports AV1, such as VLC Media Player or MPV
* Use conversion software to convert the AV1 file into a more widely-supported file format

### 2\. Can MP4 contain AV1?

Yes. While AV1 is a relatively new codec, it is already supported by many popular media players and devices. MP4 is a container format, which means it can hold multiple types of data. The data can be encoded using any codec, including AV1\. Therefore, you can encode your content in AV1 and store it in an MP4 container for playback on the devices.

![final cut pro featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/adjustment-layer-in-final-cut-pro-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Adjustment Layer in Final Cut Pro?

The adjustment layer in video editing can provide you with great ease as you can apply effects to multiple videos using this particular layer. Using the adjustment layer, you can apply effects and color grading to your video clips that come beneath this layer. So, apart from adding effects and executing color correction to individual clips, you can use an adjustment layer to generate quicker results.

After creating an adjustment layer in any video editor, you can easily cut and extend it like any other clip. You can also remove it anytime from your timeline with a single tap. In Final Cut Pro, you cannot insert adjustment layers in its timeline directly, like in Premiere Pro or After Effects.

To do so, you have to use third-party tools to create adjustment layers from scratch in Final Cut Pro. The process of creating an **adjustment layer in Final Cut Pro** is a little bit longer compared to other editors. To learn more about the adjustment layer in FCPX, continue reading this article.

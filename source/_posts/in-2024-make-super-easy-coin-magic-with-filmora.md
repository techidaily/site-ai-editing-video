## Part 1: What is the filmmaking technique "Cutting on action"

Cutting on action is a technique the editors use to cut in the middle of an action to another shot that matches the first shot's action.

![show the coin and the bottom of the glass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-4.png)

![hold the coin with the fingers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-5.jpg)

Step3 You need someone else to drop the other coin from the top. Meanwhile, you are pretending to tap a coin on the glass. You don't need to worry about someone else hand in the frame. Since you can remove it easily with the masking feature in Filmora.

## Part 4: Bring the clips into Filmora 11

Step1 If you have not downloaded Filmora, you can visit filmora.wondershare.com to download Filmora's new version.

![download Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-8.jpg)

Step2 Drag and drop the clip onto the first track of the timeline.Afterward, move the playhead to the right and find the spot where you tapped the coin last time before your friend drops the other coin. Additionally, make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action and cut.

![drag and drop the clip onto the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-9.jpg)

Step3 Then move the playhead to the right and find the spot where your friend drops the coin while you tap without the coin in your hand. Make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action, and the position of your hand roughly matches that in the last cut and make a cut.

![move the playhead to the right](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-10.jpg)

Step4 Now you need to delete the middle part and play it back. Indeed, cutting on action is the key to creating the illusion that the action is continued without editing.

![delete the middle part](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-11.jpg)

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.

## Step by Step to Cut a Video in Lightworks

Have you ever tried to edit a video, but found that it was too difficult? In this article, we will take a look at the software Lightworks and learn how to cut videos using it.

In this blog post, we will cover the cutting of videos in Lightworks. We will talk about what Lightworks is and how to download it. We'll also cover the general interface so you know which buttons do what. Finally, we'll talk about exporting a finished video and getting started with your next project in Lightworks!

## What is Lightworks?

Lightworks is an editing software created by a company called Lightworks. It's a free video editor that is incredibly powerful and has been used to edit some of the most popular films of recent years.

The software was originally designed for professional filmmakers, but it's now available for anyone to use for any type of project. You can download Lightworks from the website here - <https://www.lightworks.com/>

## Downloading the Software

First, download the Lightworks software from the website. You can do this by clicking on the big green button that says "Download the Latest Version". When you click on it, you'll be prompted to select your operating system and download the appropriate package.

Click "Next" and you'll see a license agreement and a prompt for installation details. Fill in your information and click "Next" again to start your installation.

When installation is complete, launch Lightworks by double-clicking on the Lightworks icon in your files section.

The first time you open Lightworks, you'll need to go through a few steps of initializing before using it for editing videos. This includes setting up your project settings and choosing whether or not to keep a backup of your previous work.

We will cover these initial steps separately in future blog posts, so don't worry if it's all unclear right now!

## The Interface

New users to the software will notice that there are four different windows. The first window is the Project window. This window shows you all of the footage you have loaded into your project, as well as any clips you've added to your project (see below) and edits you've made. You may also notice a timeline in this window; this is where you'll be placing your clips to create your video.

The Toolbar is located at the top of all four windows and gives quick access to commonly used features like adding clips, cropping, cutting clips, and more.

## How to Zoom Picture in Picture [Easy Solution]

Zoom is one of the greatest options on the market for video conferencing. It doesn't matter whether you use it at home or in an office environment; it will quickly link the team members. One of the most popular video conferencing programs is Zoom. When in-person meetings aren't feasible, it enables you to communicate electronically with employees, and it's been a major popularity for social occasions as well. In case you're not acquainted, picture-in-picture mode enables you to watch videos from one app while using your PC normally. The movie will keep playing in a tiny thumbnail window so that two applications may work simultaneously on your smartphone.

You may create virtual audio and video conferences, webinars, live chats, screen sharing, and other collaboration tools with Zoom, a cloud-based video communications solution. Zoom's most recent iPhone apps let you dismiss a Zoom Meeting while keeping the Zoom video call open in a picture-in-picture mode. To join a Zoom conference, you don't need an account, and because the software works with Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android devices, nearly anybody can use it. Since using Zoom's picture-in-picture mode is the same as using it with other applications, you shouldn't have any trouble if you often use PiP mode. Here are the top 4 methods you can refer to picture in picture in Zoom.

## Method 1: Swap Shared Screen with Video

You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Before leaving the meeting if you're not giving a presentation or speaking, you should definitely mute Zoom on your iPhone to prevent noises from your typing or other activities from entering the conversation. Additionally, keep in mind to switch off the camera if you're engaged in something distracting, at least for the duration of your activity. To reopen the Zoom Meeting and go back to the Zoom app, touch the Picture-in-Picture mode pane. Here are some actions to keep in mind:

### Steps to Swap Shared Screen for Zoom Picture in Picture

Step1Launch or enter a Zoom meeting. Keep the video on your main screen at all times, closing the chat and participant list as necessary.

Step2Tap the Home button or swipe up from the bottom of the screen.

![how to zoom picture in picture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/swap-shared-screen-zoom.jpg)

Step3Picture-in-picture mode should be activated automatically throughout the meeting.

## Method 2: Use Ecamm Live

Simply broadcast the Zoom app using Ecamm Live's Screen Share mode to utilize Ecamm Live for picture-in-picture virtual presentations on Zoom.

Four HDMI inputs, or four cameras that can produce an HDMI video stream, may be switched between live. This device integrates Zoom meetings fast and makes it incredibly simple to set up your audio, a sometimes-forgotten aspect of video broadcasting. This sophisticated video switcher promises to offer broadcast-quality multi-camera footage with ease and is targeted at gamers, streamers, and online reviewers. It connects to a computer via a USB-C to USB-A connection. The video feed may then be sent to distant colleagues via a number of well-liked videos streaming services, including Zoom.

You may make quick changes between inputs with no latency or disruption to your video output by using the ergonomic buttons.

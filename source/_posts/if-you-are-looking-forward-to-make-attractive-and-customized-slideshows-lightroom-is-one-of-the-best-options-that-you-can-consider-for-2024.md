## Part 3: How to Slow Down Video in Sony Vegas Pro?

[Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/) stands amongst the top video editors who excel at creating slow motions. With its powerful speed manipulation, it can curate cinematic slo-mo effects. In addition, the tool offers an Optical Flow option for ultra-high-quality slomos. It offers a non-linear timeline editing, which means selective durations to apply this effect. Given below is the step-by-step guide to **Sony V** **egas** [**slow motion**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:**

##### Step 1

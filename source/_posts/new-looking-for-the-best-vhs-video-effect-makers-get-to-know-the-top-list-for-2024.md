## Dollar-Store DIY Hacks to Use for Filmmaking on a Budget

Filmmaking is usually an expensive hobby, but slowly over time, it's become more affordable. Regular gear like cameras and lights are slightly cheaper, but there are plenty of ways to DIY regular items to use as film gear.

Making DIY film gear may not give you the same look as professional gear, but it could be a fun project and give you similar looks on a budget. In this article, let's look at some dollar-store DIY hacks that you can use for filmmaking on a budget.

![diy film gear](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-1.png)

## Tip 1\. Add foreground elements to improve the frame of videos

Let's start with something we can do to enhance your framing. Sometimes we want to direct our audience's attention to a specific part of the frame. In this case, it's the talent of placing an object in the shot's foreground that can help us do that. While also making a more attractive frame. At the dollar store, try using something like these fake plants.

![fake plants](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-2.png)

You can place it in front of your lens. Then focus on the talent behind it, giving a blurry foreground that perfectly frames the talent. Here's how the shot looks with and without foreground elements.

![framing the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Remember, you can also use a **different angle** than simply approaching the object from the front. You can try and use different perspectives until you find the shot or footage you are looking for.

## Tip 2\. Adjust lights with poster boards

The shot below looks dark and boring because the background has no light. Here's the shot with and without the lights.

![shot with or without lights](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-4.png)

A practical light is a light that shows up on screen rather than lighting talent from off-screen. For example, some dollar stores have small LED accent lights for around three dollars.

Others even have lights with adhesive backings that allow you to place them all over the room—creating great lighting accents with small eye-catching pockets of light.

![lights with adhesive backings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-5.png)

On film sets, crews use a bounce to reflect light from one light source in another direction. At the dollar store, we can find something like this poster board to get a similar effect.

![use bounce to reflect light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-6.png)

By reflecting the light onto the bounce, we get softer, more spread-out light when it's reflected. Then you will get the result in a nicer look. Using poster boards, you can do multiple things with light.

* Use white to bounce light.
* Use black as a flag to shape or block light.

![use white to bounce light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-7.png)

* You can also use green for a small green screen when filming a product video

You might have seen how big production companies create those alienated landscapes, such as in the movie Avatar and many more.

The concept is recording your object in front of a green screen behind it. Then, it's much easier to add a separately filmed background to the final footage with a video editor like Filmora.

![green screen to create the fake background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-8.gif)

## Tip 3\. Smooth audio with felt pads or socks

Do you ever have audio pop while you are recording? It can get annoying. So, to fix the issues, we are now teaching you three practical ways.

### 1\. Felt pads

Felt pads with adhesive backs can be stuck onto noisy props like a coffee mug. This way, we won't hear the mug hitting the table when we're recording sound.

![felt pads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-9.png)

### 2\. Socks as pop filters

Professionals use what they call a pop filter because a pop filter can reduce the loud pops from their mouths. But what is pop? Pops usually occur when people say words that start with the letter P or B.

Then what is a pop filter? You might have seen in some YouTube videos, especially live streamers, where they use a microphone with a plate on its head; that's called a pop filter. You can purchase pricey gear like a pop filter, or we can get a pack of cheap socks at the dollar store and place them over the mic.

It will make your voiceover slightly quieter, but it should also get rid of the popping. So keep adding socks until you hear no more pops in your voiceover.

## How to Create the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect

With stranger things season 4 ending, it seems like great timing to make a stranger things style transition to the Upside Down. In the Netflix series Stranger Things, there is an opposite version of our world called the Upside Down. The Upside Down is dark, creepy, and possibly filled with aliens, monsters, creatures, and other things.

Now, you can also apply the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect to your video! This effect combines camera tricks and video editing within [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to transition from the normal world into the Upside Down.

## How-to Guide

_**1) Preparation**_

To make this effect, you will need two footage shots: one with the camera moving down and one with the camera coming back up.

When shooting for the footage, follow the steps below:

**First shot**

1. Find any item close enough to the ground that we can block our frame with.

![block our frame with item](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-1.jpg)

1. Once you have your talent lined up, rotate your camera while lowering it below the foreground item at a constant speed and leaving the camera there. The key is making sure when you go behind the object, the frame is nothing but black.

![rotate your camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-2.gif)

For the next scene, have your actor change positions, or you can change the set around to look like the Upside Down. For instance, adding fake plants and flickering lights.

**Second shot**

Start bringing your camera back up at the same speed and rotate it again in the direction it was moving.

![start bringing your camera back up](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-3.gif)

_**2) Steps**_

After you have all the footage, you can start editing it on Filmora. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download Filmora at their official website at <https://filmora.wondershare.com>.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Now, launch Filmora on your PC and follow the steps below:

Step1 Take your first clip in the “normal” world and drag it down to a video track on the timeline. Trim the edge of the clip, so it ends on pure black and in a downward motion.

![trim the edge of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-4.jpg)

Step2 Drag the second clip (in the Upside Down) onto the video track on the timeline after the first clip. Trim this video, so it begins in pure black and an upward motion.

![trim video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-5.jpg)

Cut the clips to get the timing right since it should be a very fast transition. You can cut in the black frames so they won't be too apparent.

If you don't have a perfectly smooth transition, you can add a dissolve by going to **Transitions > Basic > Dissolve**.

![cut the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-6.jpg)

**Color Grading and Effects**

After the transition, you can make the clip look a lot more like the Upside Down from the show with a color grade and Filmora effects. Follow the steps below:

Step1 Double-click on your second clip, then go to **Color > Advanced**. For a quick edit, you can try one of the presets available, such as “cool film.” It will give you the colder blue tones that Stranger Things used for the Upside Down.

![go to color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-7.jpg)

Step2 You can further edit the color grading in the white balance menu. Drag the slider to the left to get a blue, cold vibe for the Upside Down.

The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.

![further edit the color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-8.gif)

Step3 Next, move down to the color, lower the brightness and increase contrast. It makes the scene darker and more sinister than the normal world.

![move down to the color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-9.jpg)

Step4 Finally, go down to the vignette and drag the amount slider a tiny bit to give a Vinnette around your clip.

![go down to the vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-10.jpg)

_**3) Pro Tips**_

You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.

Go to **Elements > Smoke > Smokescreen 2**. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.

![drag this element on top of your upside down clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-11.jpg)

You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.

Finally, go to the **Transition > Basic > Dissolve** to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.

![open the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-12.jpg)

## Resources from Filmostock

You can also use filmstock effects to bring our video to the next level. Go to **Elements > Fire > Large Scale 12** and drag it down on top of your clip and the smoke.

![go to elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-13.jpg)

Double-click the clip and change the scale of the effect to your needs. Then, go to compositing to change the blending mode to the screen to help the effect blend in more.

![change the scale of the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-14.jpg)

Now, go to color and open the white balance menu. Drag the two sliders to change the color of the particles to match your clip.

![go to color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-7.jpg)

Step2 You can further edit the color grading in the white balance menu. Drag the slider to the left to get a blue, cold vibe for the Upside Down.

The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.

Step3 Next, move down to the color, lower the brightness and increase contrast. It makes the scene darker and more sinister than the normal world.

Step4 Finally, go down to the vignette and drag the amount slider a tiny bit to give a Vinnette around your clip.

_**3) Pro Tips**_

You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.

Go to **Elements > Smoke > Smokescreen 2**. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.

![drag this element on top of your upside down clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-11.jpg)

You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.

Finally, go to the **Transition > Basic > Dissolve** to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.

## Resources from Filmostock

You can also use filmstock effects to bring our video to the next level. Go to **Elements > Fire > Large Scale 12** and drag it down on top of your clip and the smoke.

![go to elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-13.jpg)

Double-click the clip and change the scale of the effect to your needs. Then, go to compositing to change the blending mode to the screen to help the effect blend in more.

![change the scale of the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-14.jpg)

Now, go to color and open the white balance menu. Drag the two sliders to change the color of the particles to match your clip.

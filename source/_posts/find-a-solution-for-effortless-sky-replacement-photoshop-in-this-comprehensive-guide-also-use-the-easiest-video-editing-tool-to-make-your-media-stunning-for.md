## The Complete Guide to Making Fortnite Montage

If you're skilled at playing Fortnite, you'll probably want to share your gameplay clips as montages with other players. The popularity of Fortnite montage videos is rapidly growing because millions of people play the game. Tons of people also like watching their peers play this online video game in the form of gaming montages. We'll explain how to make a montage Fortnite that will get views when you upload it on social media platforms.

## What Is Fortnite?

Fortnite is a popular online game developed by the American game studio Epic Games. The video game was released in 2017, and it's available in three-game mode versions with the same game engine and gameplay. These are:

* Fortnite: Save the World: Set on contemporary Earth, Save the World is a co-op hybrid third-person shooter (TPS), tower defense (TD), and survival game. The game allows a maximum of four players to fight off creatures that look like zombies and defend objects with traps or fortifications they have built.
* Fortnite Battle Royale: This is a free-to-play (F2P) battle royale video game that allows up to one hundred players to fight against each other until only one person remains.
* Fortnite Creative: Released in 2018, Fortnite Creative allows players to create battle arenas and worlds. They can then share these predetermined structures with up to 16 other players for a range of multiplayer game modes that have customizable rules.

Since its release, Fortnite has become a worldwide phenomenon, with more than 350 million people playing the game across the globe. In the first year of Fortnite's release, players downloaded its mobile version 78 million times.

The game became such a global hit because it's free to play. It's also available on most gaming platforms and features an engaging theme. Additionally, because Battle Royale allows up to 100 gamers to fight it out until they find the last man standing, this means the replayability of this online video game is infinite. What's more? Each game is unique.

Fortnite has also become popular because users can purchase DLC (downloadable content) to enhance their gaming experience.

## Things to Prepare before making a Fortnite Montage video

### 1\. Fortnite Gaming Clips

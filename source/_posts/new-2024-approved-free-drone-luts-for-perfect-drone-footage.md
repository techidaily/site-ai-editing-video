**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

#### Method 1: Using Uniform Speed

Using this method, you can slow down your video smartly with the help of AI. Some options in uniform speed will help you to automate the process while ensuring the quality of the content. Look at the steps below to add slo-mo to your video like a pro:

##### Step 1Import Media to the Timeline and Explore Uniform Speed

Install Filmora 13 on your device and open it to access “New Project” from the main interface. When you enter the editing window, import your file into the media panel.

##### Step 2Adjust the Speed and Other Use Advanced Options

Later, drag that file to the timeline and right-click on it to get a list. Select the “Uniform Speed” option from that list and head to the editing panel opened to the right. Under the “Speed,” there will be a slider. You have to move it to the left for slow-motion video. While adjusting speed with that slider, track video duration from the “Duration” section. Below that option, you can toggle the “Reverse Speed” option if required.

![choose uniform speed from drop down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/making-slow-motion-videos-premiere-pro-8.jpg)

Otherwise, check the “Ripple Edit” and “Maintain Pitch” option for good. Now, extend the “AI Interpolation” menu and choose “Optical Flow.” It will let AI automatically adjust the video speed in slow motion with high quality.

#### Method 2: Using Speed Ramping

If you want to bring a professional look to Slow-motion videos, use Speed Ramping. It will ensure a smooth change in video speed when it increases or decreases. To add this refined touch to videos, look at the given steps:

##### Step 1Access the Speed Ramping Option in 2 Ways

Tap the “Speed Ramping” next to the “Uniform Speed” in the right-side panel. Optionally, you can right-click on your videos in the timeline. There, you will find the “Speed Ramping” option below the “Uniform Speed” option in the list.

##### Step 2Speed Ramping Your Videos and Get Render Preview

In the Speed Ramping Section, you will get 6 templates. Pick one or hit the “Customize” to design your own speed ramping in videos. Later, move to the toolbar of the timeline section and choose “Render Preview” next to the “Copilot” icon. It will bring a smooth playback of your speed ramping in videos.

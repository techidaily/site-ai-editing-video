## 02 Canva

Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a **picture collage with music**

Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)

## 03 Express It

You can say that "Express It" is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a **photo collage with music** **app** that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.

Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.

Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free **music photo collage** tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.

**A Good Way To Introduce A Topic**

Quizzes are an excellent way to introduce a new topic or subject matter. They can help you provide context and background information to help people understand the concepts you're trying to teach or introduce.

**Increase One's Impressions Of Your Content**

By adding a quiz, you can increase the time that someone spends on your page or channel as they work to answer the questions. This is valuable because it allows you to introduce a new topic in a fun and interactive way, along with getting more impressions on your content.

### Scene

Here are some scenes where you can use the quizzes:

**Educational**

You can use quizzes in any educational setting, such as a classroom, online course, or YouTube video, to provide knowledge to others and assess their understanding.

**Speech**

Quizzes can also be used in speeches to add interest and engagement. For instance, a motivational speaker can play a quiz during their talks to the audience to help them understand his point better and get their response.

**Presentation**

Adding a fun quiz to your presentation can help to break the monotony and keep your audience engaged throughout the session.

**Social media**

Quizzes can aid in generating engagement on your social media page. For example, you can use them to drive traffic to your website or blog or simply to get people talking about your brand.

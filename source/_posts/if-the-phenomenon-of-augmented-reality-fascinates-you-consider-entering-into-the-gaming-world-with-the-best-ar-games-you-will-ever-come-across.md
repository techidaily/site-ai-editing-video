## How To Add Scrolling Text Effect

Almost every video has some titles and texts to show to the viewers. Instead of showing static texts on the video, everyone loves to add animated texts so that the video looks attractive and engaging. If you want to show credits and titles in intro and outro of the video, you will usually see texts scrolling vertically on the video.

If you want to show any text repeatedly, you can add horizontal scrolling text effect to your video so that the repeated text does not look weird. You will need a video editor to add scrolling rolling text effect to texts and titles in your video.

## Boost the Pace of Your Instagram Reels Videos with These Simple Tricks

Undoubtedly, every social media video creator loves to make use of Instagram Reels for their widespread popularity. If you want to grab your audience's attention and keep them engaged with your videos, then Instagram Reels should be your destination. On this platform, you can only make short videos maxing out the 90-second time limit. But what if your video content is lengthy? Don't fret. One simple trick is to speed up the pace of your videos.

![instagram reels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-speed-up-video-on-instagram-reels-01.jpg)

There are two scenarios regarding how to increase the speed of the video in Reels. You can speed up the video when recording directly on the Instagram app, or use a third-party editing tool if it is a pre-recorded video. We will illustrate below how to speed up video on Instagram Reels for both scenarios.

## Part I. Basic Understanding of Instagram Reels

1. **What are Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels are short-duration, vertically-oriented videos that are displayed in the dedicated reels tab on the Instagram app. You can compare Instagram Reels with TikTok videos. The maximum duration of Instagram Reels can be of 90 seconds.

Instagram displays the popular Reels on Explore tab so that the Instagram Reels creators get more exposure. Since short-duration videos and apps are in trend, Instagram Reels has become the most popular section on the Instagram app.

Reels can be entertaining videos with popular songs in the background. They can be funny videos as well as gripping slow-motion videos. Brands promote their products and services through Reels. You can add stunning AR effects and change the speed of the video while recording Reels through the Instagram app.

1. **Why Should You Make Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels have been a game-changer in the social media world. From regular video creators and social media influencers to brands and businesses, Instagram Reels has become everyone's real deal. Here are the reasons why you should make Instagram Reels:

**Reach** \- The primary reason for making Instagram Reels is to reach out to the target audiences and get more followers. If your videos become popular, your Instagram Reels can get featured in the Explore tab. Once it does happen, there will be an exponential rise in views and followers. Besides, Instagram Reels have better reach to your followers than regular Instagram posts.

**Engagement** \- The world has moved on from photos to videos. People love to check out short videos rather than still images. So naturally, when you start making Instagram reels, your followers' engagement will increase dramatically. With more engagement, your Reels will get more exposure as people will love to share them with their friends. Of course, the content has to be top-notch so that people start to pay attention to your Reels.

![social media engagement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-speed-up-video-on-instagram-reels-02.jpg)

**Showcase Personality** \- Instagram Reels are the best way to showcase your personality on social media. Personality is the magical key that attracts followers on social media platforms. You can create different genres of videos and showcase your talent and personality to get noticed.

**Brand Promotion** \- Brands and businesses use Instagram Reels to promote their products and services. They come up with creative Reels that audiences cannot ignore. Even social media influencers promote brands through Instagram Reels these days. It is a great way to make the target audiences aware of the products and services and build a strong brand image.

Now, it has become the world’s largest search engine and visited websites after Google. It is the abode of the modern world that has something for everyone.

Per day, people spend approximately 1 billion hours watching videos on YouTube. At the same time, the users of YouTube upload approximately 300 hours of video per minute. But, do you know like Google, this video platform works on a technique known as the **YouTube AI algorithm**? The platform highly depends on these algorithms to deliver content to the viewers. As YouTube is overloaded with content, AI is a powerful weapon that helps to decide the video recommendation for the huge number of users. This recommendation system for YouTube works on certain factors.

## Part 1 The Aim of YouTube’s Algorithm

YouTube’s algorithms work with 2 major aims. Its first aim is helping the viewers easily get what they want to watch. The second aim of YouTube’s algorithm is to maximize the satisfaction rate of viewers which ultimately leads to long term engagement.

## Part 2 How the YouTube Algorithm Works

YouTube has a well defined AI-based algorithm. The working of the **YouTube algorithm AI** depends on several factors. It decides the position of videos at 6 different places as per the viewer’s interest. These locations include:

Notifications, Channel subscriptions, Trending streams, YouTube’s homepage, Recommended streams, and Search results.

Let’s understand some more facts about the working of the YouTube algorithm.

### 01How YouTube Determines The Algorithm

The traffic source for each video might be different. But YouTube’s approach to determine the algorithm for video recommendation is decided by:

**●** External factors i.e. the overall audience or market

**●** Performance i.e. the success rate of video

**●** Personalization i.e. the history and preferences of viewers

### 02How YouTube Determines Its Homepage Algorithm

You might have found a large array of videos when you type Youtube.com or open the app. YouTube shows these videos thinking that person might be interested in watching any video from the list. The selection of these videos is based on performance and personalization. Performance is measured depending on the metrics such as viewer surveys, likes, dislikes, average percentage viewed, average view duration, and click-through rates. Personalization means the selection of videos based on the past behavior of the viewers.

### 03How YouTube Determines Its Suggested Video Algorithm

When a person watches any video on YouTube, they always find some video options to watch on the right side. These videos are decided by the suggested videos algorithm. Such videos are decided by AI based on the viewer's interest in a particular visit. The recommendations for these videos are decided by the following:

**●** Performance

**●** Personalization

**●** Videos watched by the user in the past

**●** Topically related videos

**●** Videos that are often watched together

### 04How YouTube Determines Its Search Algorithm

Just like Google, YouTube is also a search engine. Its search algorithm works when a user comes to search for a particular video or keyword. When the viewer types something on the search bar, it decides the recommendation based on:

**●** Keywords used on the metadata of video

**●** Performance of the video

## Part 3 Ways to Improve the Odds of Your Video = Ranking Well With the YouTube Algorithm

Algorithms work following the actions of the audience and the creator’s intelligence. If you are planning to do YouTube marketing or are struggling to get your video ranked or appear trending, then let us help you with it. Here, we will let you know about the ways to increase the views. These ways will increase the odds of your video ranking well with the YouTube algorithm. So, let’s understand what all you need to do:

### 01Keyword Research Is Important

YouTube decides the recommendations based on the user's action. What they type to search for a particular video keyword plays a very important role. So, you need to understand your target audience and research the keyword that the target audience might be interested in.

Do proper keyword research and put the keywords in the following places:

**●** The filename of the video

**●** Title of the video

**●** Description of the video (first 2 lines)

**●** Script of the video (subtitle and closed caption)

**Note:** It is not required to put the keyword in the video tags.

## Here, You Will Get the Basic Steps to Use the Speed Ramping Effect in Your Videos by Wondershare Filmora Software. In This Article, You Get a Guide to Adding the BCC Glitch Effect to Give Your Sports Montages a More Professional Look

Are you tired of using the same old way to edit your montages? Or do you want to learn to be more professional in your creativity? Don't worry. We got you.

Here you will learn how to take your videos to the next level using speed ramping with a professional video editor- Wondershare Filmora. Moreover, you will get to know two ways to add the effect.

1. Using speed ramping effect and glitch effects.
2. Using the standard speed settings.

These effects can work well for any action sports or dance video. Let's check out about speed ramping effect and ways to add it.

## Part 1\. What is speed ramping?

You've probably seen speed ramping used in suspenseful moments of a basketball video before, like a ball bouncing on the rim or a long buzzer-beating shot.

![cinematic shots of a basketball player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-1.gif)

With speed ramping, we can slow down our most exciting moments to show our audience. And then speed it up again to keep pace with the music or action. So it will give you a smooth transition effect.

## Part 2\. How to enhance action videos with the speed ramping effect?

For example, we'll create an intense basketball video with speed ramping and glitch effects in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Then, to show you how to show off your filming, editing, and basketball skills.

##### Step1 Shot the footage

To edit a montage, you must first capture it correctly. For our example footage, we want to ensure we have set our camera to a higher frame rate for filming this type of video since we're going to use slow motion.

![shot footage from a higher angels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-2.jpg)

**How to capture the best footage?**

You can shoot handheld with a camera or a mobile phone because it allows you to move around your talent and catch some movements and action while giving a shaky camera effect for added suspense. To make evenly balanced videos, you can use a gimbal stabilizer. Here are some tips to get better shots.

* Change camera angles. Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.
* Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.
* Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.
* Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.

Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage. Finally, we will dive into edit tutorials on speed ramping and glitch effects separately for better understanding.

##### Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora

There are two ways to achieve the speed ramping effect. One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speedâ€”the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.

**Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora**

The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let's start by opening Filmora.

1\. Import media

First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.

![library in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg)

2\. Apply the speed ramping feature

To apply the speed ramping feature, **right-click** on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose **speed ramping** to open the settings window.

![add speed ramping option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-4.jpg)

You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.

![speed templates on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-5.jpg)

The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.

![adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-6.gif)

Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.

After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.

**Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora**

Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.

1\. You can **drag** the video from your library to the timeline. While in the **timeline**, double-click to open the speed menu. Then choose the starting speed you want your video to be with the speed slider.

![uniform speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-7.jpg)

2\. Next, move your playhead to the **point of the video** you want to slow down the speed. Here we will cut and then double-click that clip to open the speed menu again. Change the pace with the speed slider again

![split adjusting the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-8.gif)

Following the above steps, a speed ramping style effect can be created without using the premium feature. Stealthy, isn't it?

##### Step3 Add some intensity to shots with the BCC glitch effect

We will use Boris FX BCC glitch to add some intensity to our video. It is a plug-in built-in Filmora and gives a feeling of chaos to match the action in the video. To apply the BCC glitch effect to the video.

* Click on the effects options in the top bar. For example, a window on the left side showing you the option Boris FX will have a sub-option BCC stylize. Click on it.
* Drag the effect above the place you want it in the timeline.
* Double-click the effect to open its settings.
* A drop-down menu at the top of the screen has tons of glitch presets to try out.
* We are going to scroll down and select shake with motion blur. This preset will use the exact look we want for our basketball video to make the speed ramping more intense.

![present a drop-down menu and reduce the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-9.gif)

* You can change the settings around after choosing a preset. For example, let's turn up the glitch intensity to have our glitch a little more extreme. Moving further, we can change the glitch duration to our specific needs.

Now we can watch our video to see our glitch with the motion blur effect. Isn't it crazy to make a cinematic video by yourself? The speed ramping feature and glitch effects can bring any sports video to the next level.

### **How to Edit MP4 Video in Filmora**

You never know what you'll want in the video editing room, and that is why you must equip yourself thoroughly for all of the obstacles that will arise during the video editing process. Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.

To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:

1. **Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio**

When you're ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora's desktop icon. The software's greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-2.jpg)

1. **Make a New Project**

Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software's welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora's video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg)

Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You'll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.

1. **Import Your Files**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-4.jpg)

Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.

1. **Organize Your Clips**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-5.jpg)

Filmora's Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.

1. **Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don't belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-6.jpg)

To evaluate the video clips you've uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.

1. **Apply Visual Effects**

You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora's many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-7.jpg)

If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text /Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the required text.

1. **Export Your Final Output**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-8.jpg)

Hit the Export button when you're sure there's nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.

Choose the type that better serves the project you're working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.

Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you'll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.

## **#2: iMovie**

**It is available in Windows and Mac OS.**

This software is a consumer-grade video editor that is available for free. Users who would like to produce videos with material from their Photos library quickly will benefit from the app. iMovie has a more straightforward timeline editor that excludes multi-track editing to make things easier.

Picture-in-picture video and slow-motion or fast-forward special effects are also supported. With iMovie, you can create titles, drag-and-drop effects, and insert motion graphics like 3D globes or travel maps. You can find ready-to-use music and sound effects in the program.

### **How to Edit MP4 Video in Filmora**

You never know what you'll want in the video editing room, and that is why you must equip yourself thoroughly for all of the obstacles that will arise during the video editing process. Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.

To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:

1. **Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio**

When you're ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora's desktop icon. The software's greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-2.jpg)

1. **Make a New Project**

Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software's welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora's video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg)

Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You'll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.

1. **Import Your Files**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-4.jpg)

Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.

1. **Organize Your Clips**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-5.jpg)

Filmora's Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.

1. **Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don't belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-6.jpg)

To evaluate the video clips you've uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.

1. **Apply Visual Effects**

You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora's many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-7.jpg)

If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text /Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the required text.

1. **Export Your Final Output**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-8.jpg)

Hit the Export button when you're sure there's nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.

Choose the type that better serves the project you're working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.

Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you'll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.

### **How to Edit MP4 Video in Filmora**

You never know what you'll want in the video editing room, and that is why you must equip yourself thoroughly for all of the obstacles that will arise during the video editing process. Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.

To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:

1. **Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio**

When you're ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora's desktop icon. The software's greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-2.jpg)

1. **Make a New Project**

Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software's welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora's video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg)

Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You'll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.

1. **Import Your Files**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-4.jpg)

Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.

1. **Organize Your Clips**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-5.jpg)

Filmora's Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.

1. **Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don't belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-6.jpg)

To evaluate the video clips you've uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.

1. **Apply Visual Effects**

You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora's many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-7.jpg)

If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text /Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the required text.

1. **Export Your Final Output**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-8.jpg)

Hit the Export button when you're sure there's nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.

Choose the type that better serves the project you're working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.

Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you'll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.

## Best Tips for Better Event Videography

There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional

corporate event video production. This is something that can't be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people's awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.

Let's start!

![event videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/event-videography.jpg)

## 1\. A quality corporate event video represents your business

People who are watching your corporate event video aren't just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They're also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone's phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.

You don't, but it's an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.

## 2\. A professional videographer is capable of editing

Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it's knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.

Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won't have the same

effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.

## 3\. A professional video is completed on schedule

It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or

delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.

If you're trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent

videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video

to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.

## 4\. A skilled videographer avoids interference

A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.

If you're not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you're bothering your guests and

messing up the event while you're trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as

well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don't want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.

## 5\. A video that is done well tells a story

Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story

in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in

what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It's that storyline that is going

to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.

It's also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.

## 6\. A videographer has a shot list

It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.

Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio

and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.

## Conclusion

We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special

events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and

your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the

worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won't be

many situations that you won't be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to

remain calm, cool, and professional.

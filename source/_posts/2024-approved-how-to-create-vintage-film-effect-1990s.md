## How to Create Vintage Film Effect 1990S

In the 90s, movie production technology improved a lot. This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological. In fact, we can say that the horror movies of the 90s laid the foundation for current horror movies. So, without wasting time, let's create a 1990s horror movie similar to The Blair Witch Project.

## Preparation

![1990s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1990s-vintage-scene.gif)

The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you've watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It's even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.

How to create a 1990s horror film with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1 Add the horror video to the timeline

![add the horror video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-1.jpg)

Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.

##### Step2 Apply color grading

![apply color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-2.jpg)

Next, double-click the horror clip and go to the **Color** menu. Then, click the **Tone** arrow before lowering the **Saturation** to -50%. This will give us a less saturated look popularly used in horror films.

![double-click the horror clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-3.jpg)

Now click the **3D LUT** option and choose a LUT that works for your film. For this horror film project, we'll select the **Dark Film** option.

##### Step3 Add creepiness to the video

![add creepiness to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-4.jpg)

Obviously, you'll want your horror film to look as creepy as possible. To achieve that, click the **Elements** tab, then search for the **Smokescreen 1** effect. Move the effect to the timeline above the video track before trimming the effect clip to fit with the original horror video.

![click the elements tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-5.jpg)

We'll now change the size and positioning of the smokescreen effect to match the feature video. To do that, double-click the effect track. You can also reduce the opacity to around 30% to make the smoke more visible.

##### Step4 Add a retro filming effect

![add a retro filming effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-6.jpg)

Now we'll make the film more believable by adding a retro overlay. Click the **Effects** tab, then search for **Retro Film Overlay 15** before dragging and dropping the effect above all the tracks in the editing timeline.

## EasyHDR Review: Is This a Good Choice to Create HDR

Any professional photographer knows that “photography” is a broad niche. For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you'll need an HDR program like **EasyHDR**. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether **Easy HDR** is worth the money or not. We'll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.

## Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR

Before we dive deeper into this **Easy HDRi** review, let's first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:

### 1\. Effectiveness - 4.8/5

The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn't have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.

### 2\. Price - 4.7/5

Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there's a free demo version, it's pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.

### 3\. Supported OS - 5/5

This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!

### 4\. Ease of use - 4.8

Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.

### 5\. Best for - Beginner HDRi editors

This program's simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you're a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.

**Our Verdict**

Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.

The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33/lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.

But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it's the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.

 Pros

* Simple layout.
* Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.
* Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.
* Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.
* Batch processing supported.
* Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.

 Cons

* It doesn't have advanced HDR post-processing tools.
* No HDR feature for editing.

## Part 2\. Detailed Review for Easy HDR

Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it's important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can't save HDRi in TIFF format. Let's get in!

### 1\. High-Quality Bracket Merging

A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.

### 2\. Editing features

EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.

### 3\. Ghost removal

No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.

### 4\. HDR batch processing

As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.

### 5\. LDR enhancement

Although we've mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it's important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.

## Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop

Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.

With that in mind, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It's a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you'll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. Filmora 11 works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key/green screen, etc.

**Steps to add an HDR effect to a standard video on Filmora 11:**

##### Step1Open the video on Filmora 11

![easy hdr alternative load video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-1.jpg)

Run Wondershare Filmora 11 on your Mac/Win computer and start a new project. After creating a project, click Import Media to upload the video to edit and move it to the storyboard.

##### Step2Add a blending mode effect

![easy hdr alternative add white sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-2.jpg)

Next, select the video and choose White as the color overlay. To do that, open the Sample color options and move the While color on the top timeline.

![easy hdr alternative add exclusion blending mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-3.jpg)

After that, it's time to change the Blending Mode of the color overlay. To do that, right-click the color track and choose Edit Properties. Then tap Composition and then select Exclusion on the Blending Mode drop-down menu.

##### Step3Apply the B&W Film color effect

![easy hdr alternative add b and w film effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-4.jpg)

Now tap the Effect tab and search for the B&W Film effect. This film effect should be free to use whether using a paid or free account. After downloading it, add the effect overlay to the video track and export the video.

##### Step4Import the uploaded video

![easy hdr alternative set overlay blending mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-5.jpg)

After creating the video, import it on Filmora 11 and delete the white color overlay and W&B Film effects. Now add the imported video on the first track, then search and apply a Square Blur effect. Also, change the Blending Mode of the footage to Overlay. Meanwhile, click the Effect tab and adjust the Size slider accordingly. For example, you can choose 10.

![easy hdr alternative add luma sharp effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-6.jpg)

Don't stop there. Open the Effects tab and add the Lomo effect to your video. Also, search and add the Luma Sharp effect. Remember that you can retouch these effects accordingly under the Effect tab. And lastly, export the new HDR video. That's it!

## Final Words

There you have it. Easy HDR is arguably the most-beginner friendly program to edit your photos on desktops. Although it doesn't feature much, the available editing features should be enough to help you create incredible HDR images.

Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.

### 4\. HDR batch processing

As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.

### 5\. LDR enhancement

Although we've mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it's important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.

## Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop

Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.

With that in mind, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It's a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you'll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. Filmora 11 works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key/green screen, etc.

**Steps to add an HDR effect to a standard video on Filmora 11:**

##### Step1Open the video on Filmora 11

![easy hdr alternative load video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-1.jpg)

##### Step2Add a blending mode effect

##### Step4Import the uploaded video

![easy hdr alternative set overlay blending mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-5.jpg)

After creating the video, import it on Filmora 11 and delete the white color overlay and W&B Film effects. Now add the imported video on the first track, then search and apply a Square Blur effect. Also, change the Blending Mode of the footage to Overlay. Meanwhile, click the Effect tab and adjust the Size slider accordingly. For example, you can choose 10.

![easy hdr alternative add luma sharp effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-6.jpg)

Don't stop there. Open the Effects tab and add the Lomo effect to your video. Also, search and add the Luma Sharp effect. Remember that you can retouch these effects accordingly under the Effect tab. And lastly, export the new HDR video. That's it!

## Final Words

There you have it. Easy HDR is arguably the most-beginner friendly program to edit your photos on desktops. Although it doesn't feature much, the available editing features should be enough to help you create incredible HDR images. And don't forget to use [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to apply a cool HDR effect to your footage. Give it a try!

## How To Make a Video Podcast

Starting a video podcast can be quite intimidating, but the truth is; having the proper knowledge will help you do things more correctly.

As we all know, knowledge is the key to success. So, for you to navigate your way around the video podcasting industry easily, you need to consume enough information that will enable you to make fewer wrong decisions.

To help you out, we took our time to do more research on how to record video podcasts, and in this post, we will share all you need to know to record a video podcast that stands out.

## Part 1\. But first: why record with a video?

If you've done a little research, you'll notice many podcasters switched to recording with videos instead of audio. Did they decide to start doing that so we could see their faces? Well, the answer is NO. But before we discuss more on that, you should know what a video podcast is and its types.

You guessed right. A video podcast is a podcast with video. The video element could be a static image or a video recording of the podcast host and the guest. A video podcast will help you do the following;

**1\. Enhance the visual content**

Research shows that humans learn more from what they visualize than what is heard. Yes, this is because 30% of the human brain comprises neurons dedicated to visual processing, and just 3% is dedicated to hearing. Besides, videos are always more engaging compared to audio. So why not combine both to boost your podcast performance?

**2\. Level up the personality and relatability**

Most people have more belief in what they see than what is heard. So, video podcasts allow audiences to easily see your expression and understand your passion for the subject you discuss. It also builds a deeper level of connections between you and them. Also, it helps to add to the originality of your podcast and your brand as a whole.

**3\. Make the content more accessible**

Your podcast show becomes more accessible when it's in the video. You won't be limited to just uploading it on podcast platforms but also on social media as a short TikTok trailer, Instagram post, YouTube video, etc. Doing this will get your content in front of a wide range of audience, thus prompting more people to engage with your podcast.

## Part 2\. Get your gear set up

The first step to starting a video podcast is getting your gear set up. We recommend you start with the following podcast equipment:

* A camera (if recording a video podcast)
* Microphone(s)
* Headphone(s)
* Memory cards
* Tripods
* Computers
* Recording software or a digital audio workstation

Let's dig deeper into each of these. We've compiled the best podcast equipment for beginners and pros alike based on our extensive research.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

### 3\. Declutter

You can apply LUTs using different video editing software. For instance, there is Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, and others to apply LUT. Just load the LUT and apply it to your video clips or the whole project. Moreover, you can make adjustments to the LUT according to your preference.

In addition, LUTs come in different file formats, such as .cube, .3dl, .look, or .icc. The most common one is .cube. Furthermore, different video editing tools support different formats. Moreover, choose the right format for your editing software and the colors you want.

**Customizing LUTs and Non-Destructive Editing**

You don't have to stick with pre-made LUTs. Additionally, you can create your own or modify existing ones to match your needs and style. Advanced color grading software lets you tweak individual colors, contrast, saturation, and more. Save these adjustments as custom LUTs for future use.

The great thing about LUTs is that they don't mess with your original video file. They're like a layer that sits on top, making real-time changes during playback or rendering. Moreover, you can always return to the original footage or make further adjustments without losing data.

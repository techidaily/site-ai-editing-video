##### Step 3Customize Speed Ramping to Smoothly Slow Down Videos

Otherwise, hit the “Customize” and direct downward. Go to the editing panel and hold the dots to move downward if you want to slow down. You can speed up video portions by holding the dots upward. Meanwhile, you can play the video to see the changes.

##### Step 4Use Optical Flow for Good Quality and Move to Save Changes

Extend the “AI Frame Interpolation” menu and hit the “Optical Flow.” That’s how you will get a high-quality video with slow speed. Keep editing or save changes through the “Export” button on the upper right.

### Find Core Functionalities of Wondershare Filmora

Before using Filmora, it’s important to explore it to avoid confusion. Considering this point, you should discover some of its main features below:

#### 1\. [AI Copywriting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Except for AI, no one can provide you with an engaging script on short notice. Thus, Filmora integrates an AI copywriting feature for generating the desired script within seconds. It accepts natural language prompts, not limiting experts to giving commands. This feature is considered professional in creating YouTube descriptions to rank the content.

#### 2\. [AI Copilot Editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Humans typically need suggestions in editing, whether they are beginners or professionals. What could be better than having an AI as your personal editing assistant? Filmora offers an AI copilot editor that answers your editing-related queries. Besides, it navigates you toward practical solutions by providing links or buttons.

#### 3\. [AI Audio Denoise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Sometimes, background noises ruin the vocals of the audio. Remove that noise with the help of AI, which can detect the noise type for exact results. This feature can enhance your audio by performing reverb reduction. It can make the voice clear that is present in surroundings, like electrical voices from devices. Audio denoise proves vital in recording podcasts and online course recording scenarios.

#### 4\. [AI Portrait](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It’s a human urge to look beautiful, and video editing apps are not denying it. Filmora also provides more than 70 AI portrait effects to beautify facial features. Moreover, it can assist you in removing the background and keeping humans in video frames. Some AI stickers include Heart eyes, Emojis, and Sunglasses that can evoke humorous emotions.

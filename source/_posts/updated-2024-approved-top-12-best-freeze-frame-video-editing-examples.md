## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

But several movie directors have effectively used the **freeze-frame** video editing technique that wowed the audience.

Here is a list of the best **freeze frame examples** you would love;

The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, "Ding Dong."

The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.

While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.

Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a **freeze-frame** as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.

## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

But several movie directors have effectively used the **freeze-frame** video editing technique that wowed the audience.

Here is a list of the best **freeze frame examples** you would love;

### 01**The Departed**

![The Departed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-1.jpg)

In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.

He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.

### 02**Rocky III**

![Rocky III](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-2.jpg)

The **freeze-frame** came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.

During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.

The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, "Ding Dong."

The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.

### 03**400 Blows**

![400 blows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-3.jpg)

In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.

In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.

He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.

### 04**Thelma and Louise**

![Thelma and Louise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-4.jpg)

Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.

While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.

Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a **freeze-frame** as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.

Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.

### 05**The Wolf of Wall Street**

![The wolf of wall street](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-5.jpg)

Scorsese uses freeze-frame at the beginning of this movie, just as he did in Good Fellas. The freeze-frame effect here helps introduce the character and shows us the plot of the movie hence piquing the audience's interests immediately.

### 06**Out of Sight**

![Out of Sight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-6.jpg)

This movie is another excellent example of **freeze-frame** video editing. What other way to pique the audience's interest significantly and emphasize them than capture them in a freeze-frame.

### 07**Death Proof**

![Death Proof](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-7.jpg)

In this movie, the freeze-frame stays till the very end. It captures three women as they raise their hands-on celebration after successfully beating to death a psychopath who has been killing young women.

### 08**Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid**

![Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-8.jpg)

This movie follows two train robbers, Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, known as the 'Sundance Kid.' After conducting several robberies, they go on the run as the authorities pursue them. After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.

Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a **freeze-frame** brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.

### 09**Good Fellas**

![Good fellas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-9.jpg)

Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in 'Good Fellas' to emphasize the movie plot.

In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.

They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a **freeze-frame** before uttering the lines, "As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster."

This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.

### 10**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**

![Hardy Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-10.jpg)

## What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?

If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you'll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let's look at the differences between these two operations.

### Trimming

Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.

The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers' attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.

### Cutting

Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You'll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.

This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What's more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.

You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.

People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.

## How to Trim videos in Premiere Pro in Different Ways

You can trim video Premiere Pro on the timeline or program. Let's look at these two methods.

### Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline

If you are wondering: What is a timeline? It's the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.

Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don't alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.

To learn how to trim video in Premiere Pro on the timeline, follow the steps below.

1. Double click on the video file you want to trim in Premiere Pro.
2. Adjust the timings of your edits. Drag the ends of your video clip as if you are resizing a window to shorten or extend by trimming. As your cursor gets closer at the edge of the video clip, you'll see a red arrow.

1. You can also use the Q and W keys on your keyboard to Premiere Pro trim video. The Q key removes unwanted content at the beginning of the clip, while the W key trims the end of the clip.
2. Choose the Selection tool once you've finished using the trimming tools.

### Method 2:Trim Clips in the Program

You can also trim videos in the Program Monitor. Follow the guide below to learn how to trim a video in Premiere Pro program monitor.

1. Double-click the end of your video clip to enter the Trim Mode in the program.
2. To trim, drag on the images of your video in the program monitor. You can also use the buttons on the panel.

![trimming video in premiere pro program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-4.png)

## Extra Tips About Trimming Videos in Premiere Pro

We have provided some tips that you should keep in mind when using Adobe Premiere trim video.

### How to Trim a Video without Re-Rendering?

When adding a video to Premiere Pro, it will be rendered by this software application to ensure high-quality playback and speed. Rendering takes time afterward, leading to loss of quality; however, it makes sure you have gotten the best video quality as much as possible by removing skipped frames and lag from the video playback.

If you are wondering how to trim videos in Premiere Pro without re-render follow the steps below:

1. Import your video to Premiere Pro by launching the application and choosing 'Import Media to Start'. Browse and select the video you want to trim.
2. The video will appear in the media library area at the bottom of the screen.
3. Drag and drop the video from the media library to the timeline. You'll see the complete video clip duration in the timeline.
4. You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.
5. Hold the 'Ctrl' key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You'll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.
6. You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.
7. Choose the 'Laser Tool' located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.
8. Follow steps 2 to 4 to trim from cuts you've just made.

![trimming video without re-rendering in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-5.png)

1. Go to 'File' and choose the 'Export' option. Tap 'Media' from the list, and you will be directed to the export setting. Here, you can adjust specific settings, such as quality, name, and format. Click 'Export' after entering the appropriate information.

![trim video without re-rendering in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-6.png)

### Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming

When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.

Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.

![unlink audio from video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-7.png)

Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.

### How to Trim and Re-Encode Videos without Re-Rendering

Follow the method below to trim video Premiere Pro and encode it without rendering it.

1. Launch Premiere Pro and navigate to File, then choose import. Find the video that you want to trim and double click on it.
2. Drag and drop the video into the timeline.
3. Choose the 'Ripple Edit Tool' and then Press 'Sequence'. Head to 'Sequence Settings' and set or modify the codec, bitrate, name, format, and much more.
4. Adjust the Ripple so that it defines the end time and start time that you want for your video.
5. Now, finalize the trim by choosing 'File' and tap 'Export'. To 'Export Settings,' elect 'Media'.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to trim videos in Premiere Pro, you can remove unnecessary portions at the beginning or end of your videos. In turn, your videos will attract more viewers.

### Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming

When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.

Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.

![unlink audio from video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-7.png)

Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.

## What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?

If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you'll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let's look at the differences between these two operations.

### Trimming

Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.

The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers' attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.

### Cutting

Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You'll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.

This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What's more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.

You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.

People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.

## How to Create Chroma Key Written Text Effects in Filmora

Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.

## Part 1\. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?

Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.

![chroma key text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png)

Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it's an easy way to make 3D motion videos.

To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:

## Part 2\. Filming Tips for Written Texts

To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.

### Tip 1\. A Pen and a White Paper

We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.

We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:

![purple color pen on white paper](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png)

It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it's more apparent during filming.

### Tip 2\. Different Color Paper

There are many chances that you don't have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don't need to worry because you can use different color papers too.

But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.

![different color paper with different markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don't use dull color pens with bright color paper.

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

### Tip 4\. Larger Size of Letters

As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

![the larger size of the written key text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-5.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.

After filming all the clips, you must edit those shots on the Filmora to get the chroma effect. Scroll more to get the step-by-step process!

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

Therefore, a video transition effect sits in between two shots and connects them together smoothly so that it does not look odd to the eyes. Video editing with transitions is a common practice for short videos on social media, presentation videos, and even movies.

## Part 3\. Video transitions tips and tricks

If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.

**Consistency** – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.

**Experiment** – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.

**Out of the Box** – The reason you recommended [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.

**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.

**Meaningful** – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood. Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.

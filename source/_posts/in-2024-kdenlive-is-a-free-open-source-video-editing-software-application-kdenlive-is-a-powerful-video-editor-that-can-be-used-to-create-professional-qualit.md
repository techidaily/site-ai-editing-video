### Step-by-step on how to rotate videos using Filmora

Two ways to rotate your videos using Filmora: by using the rotate option when you right click it or changing the project settings. The rotate filter is a video effect that allows you to rotate your video clip around its vertical and horizontal axes.

To apply the rotate filter...

Step 1: Import your video clip into Filmora.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-11.png)

Step 2: Right-click on the video.

Step 3: Select ‘Rotate 90 CW’ or click Ctrl + Alt + Right to rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-12.png)

Step 4: Select ‘Rotate 90 CCW’ or click Ctrl + Alt + Left to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise.

Step 5: Repeat the steps until you are satisfied. Note: It can only rotate the video in the degrees of multiples of 90.

Step 6: The video is now rotated.

Filmora's rotate filter is very similar to Kdenlive's. However, there are a few differences. For example...

\- you can use the rotate filter on clips that are already rotated

\- you can change the rotation orientation of your clip.

If you need to rotate your video clip in a different direction, or if you want to create a 360-degree rotation, follow the below steps:

Click on the ‘Edit’ option in the tool above the timeline.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-13.png)

Select the ‘Transform’ option, then go to ‘Rotate’

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-14.png)

Use the slider to set the amount of rotation you need.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-15.png)

Click OK to apply the changes.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-16.png)

The project settings allow you to rotate your video clip in any direction you need.

Both Filmora and Kdenlive offer a rotate filter that allows you to rotate your video clip by a certain amount. However, only Filmora offers the ability to rotate your video clip in any direction you need. Additionally, Filmora offers a wide range of features that can be used to create professional-quality videos. If you need to rotate your video clip in a different direction, or if you want to create a 360-degree rotation, Filmora is the best option.

Step 2: Open the Effects tab and expand the Transform, Distort Perspective tab.

## Make A Tattoo Disappear Like A Magic

Do you have any tattoos that you don't like anymore? Have you ever wished you had the superpower to make unwanted tattoos vanish? Then, keep reading this article since this article will provide you with how to use masking and colour correction to make a tattoo disappear in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 1: What You'll Need to Getting ready

Step1 The first thing you need is a video clip of your arm. Next, place the camera on a tripod, and tilt down to show the table from the top.

![need a video clip of your arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-1.jpg)

Step2 After that, put the arm on the tableand keep it still while filming. Meanwhile, have another hand perform on the other side of the frame and pretend to use magic to remove the tattoo.

![put the arm on the tableand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-2.gif)

Step3 Next, you need a picture of a tattoo. Indeed, it would be better to have the tattoo in the same position on the arm so it can match the video clip we just filmed.

Step2 Add a mask around the tattoo part from the picture. You must hide the first video track to see the mask clearly.Then, double-click on the picture on the timeline and go to the setting window on the top left. Find the Mask Section and select the circle shape. Now you can see the mask is applied.

![add a mask around the tattoo part](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-6.jpg)

Step3 Adjust the position and size of the mask to reveal only the tattoo part. Then you must change the "Blur Strength" to add more blur to the edge of the mask.

If you are a Mac user, QuickTime Player is where you play and watch videos. QuickTime by Apple comes pre-installed on every Mac. It happens to be the default video player for macOS users.

When you have a short video clip, it is usual that you want to watch it in a loop. The same is applicable to music videos. You may want to listen to the song repeatedly in the background while you work on your Mac. You may also want to show a demonstration video endlessly on the display screen. In all such scenarios, you have to play a loop video on QuickTime. We will illustrate how to play a video in a loop on QuickTime.

## Part 1\. Steps to Loop Video with QuickTime Player

Adobe After Effects is an ever-growing product, with new features introduced almost every year. One of these features is the 3D **Camera Tracking,** which allows you to take your motion graphic effects to the next level.

**Camera Tracking** is extracting the camera movement from a recorded video sequence. This process allows filmmakers to add computer-generated elements to a live action shot, track objects throughout a shot for compositing, and estimate camera movements for virtual reality applications.

In this article, we will explore what Camera **Tracking** is and Motion Tracking in After Effect. We'll also show you how to use 3D Camera Tracking in After Effects on a Windows PC.

## Part 1\. What Is Camera Tracking

Camera Tracking is a process that determines the movement of a video clip. This information can be used to add certain effects to the video, such as objects that seem to follow the camera or text that appears to be stationary in the frame.

Camera Tracking is a relatively simple process, but it can be time-consuming. However, the results are often worth the effort, as it can add a whole new level of realism to your footage clips.

For example, you have taken a video clip of a zoo and want to add an object to it while making sure it gives a realistic look. This is where the **Camera Tracking** feature can help you make a smooth transition and add the element as if it was there.

## Part 2\. Why Use Camera Tracking?

Now that you know what Camera Tracking is, let's have a look at some benefits of using it:

* Add a 3D object or element to a 2D video clip.
* Embed objects, texts, etc., to a video.
* Stabilize a shaky camera/video clip.
* Create special effects.
* Apply color grading.
* Replace a TV or PC screen with some information.

Thus, if you need some basic compositions or advanced ones, the Camera Tracking feature will help you track your videos, embed anything you want, or create special effects to make your clip different.

## Part 3\. Motion Tracking In After Effects

The Motion Tracking capability is Adobe After Effects' feature that allows you to track the movement of the camera/an object in a video clip and use the data to add effects to objects.

Motion tracking can be used for various effects, like creating realistic text animations or adding special effects to objects in a video.

There are four main types of Motion Tracking in After Effects, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:

### Single Point Tracking

Single Point tracking tracks a single position in a video clip. You can use it for composing a video clip with a single point of focus, and it is suitable for following the movement of an object with right-left or up-down motion.

**Advantage:** Single Point Tracking is perfect for tracking a single position or motion of a single object.

**Disadvantage:** No scale or rotation properties and needs a clear contrast point for effective results.

### Two Point Tracking

Two Point Tracking is a feature that allows you to track two points in a footage clip and can be used for scale, motion, and rotation tracking.

**Advantage:** Two Point Tracking can track scale and rotation along with the motion.

**Disadvantage:** It doesn't give effective results with a shaky video clip.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Four Point Tracking

The Four Point Tracking feature lets you track four different points (corners) in your footage and apply the tracking data to a layer in your composition.

The four points can be placed at the screen's corners in your shot, and new footage is applied to cover the screen.

**Advantage:** Directly pins the data to each corner of the image.

**Disadvantage:** Cannot be used to create a 3D object.

### 3D Camera Tracking

With 3D camera tracking, you can track the movement of a camera in a video and place 3D elements in the scene that match the camera's movement. This is a great way to add realism to your graphics and make them look like they're part of the scene.

**Advantage:** 3D Camera Tracking can help you add shapes, texts, or 3D objects to 2D footage.

**Disadvantage:** A bit tricky and needs an expert grip on the tool to use effectively.

## Part 4\. How To Use 3D Camera Tracking In After Effects Of Windows

Here's a simple and quick rundown of how to use 3D camera tracking in After Effects:

##### Step1Import Your Video Footage

Launch **Adobe After Effects**, create a new composition, and import your footage. Once your clip is uploaded, click the **Window Menu.** Scroll down and choose **"Tracker."**

![importing the video footage and heading to the tracker option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/importing-the-video-footage-and-heading-to-the-tracker-option.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Here you will see four tracking options:

1. Track Camera
2. Warp Stabilizer
3. Track Motion
4. Stabilize Motion

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
##### Step2Establish The Tracking Points

You have to select the tracking points and a plane to which it must be tracked. To do this, hover over the tracking point references in the **After Effect compositions window**. Between the three tracking points, a triangle will form, and a red **"target"** will appear to help you better visualize the plane.

Now, you have to find a **tracking point** that lays the red **"target"** parallel to your selected plane. Next, select the triangle that lines up best for your surface. Move the **arrow** away to disable the picker and stop the red **"target."**

##### Step3Add The Text To Your Video Clip

Once you define the plane, it's time to add text to your video clip. To do this, right-click on the **triangle** you have set previously, and a window will appear, allowing you to create new layers.

Click **"Create Text"** to place the text on your tracked video clip. A new text layer will be added using the tracking data.

![adding text to the video footage in the after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-text-to-the-video-footage-in-the-after-effects.png)

##### Step4Align Text On Tracked Footage

Now you have to align your text. In the timeline, locate the **tracked text layer** and click the **arrow** to the left to unveil all the editable properties for the layer.

Click the **"Transform"** option to use the transform options and use the layer lines to adjust the **X, Y, and Scale** values afterward.

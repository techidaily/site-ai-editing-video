## Master Premiere Pro: Custom Sequence Presets

You've probably heard of Adobe Premiere Pro – it's a top-tier video editing software that's widely recognized in the market. But have you delved into the nitty-gritty of sequence presets? A custom sequence preset is your best friend for maintaining consistency across projects.

It allows users to save specific settings for sequence attributes like frame rate, resolution, and audio settings. Instead of reconfiguring these settings for each new project, a custom sequence preset lets you jump right into editing. Now, how do you create one? Keep reading!

## Part 1: How to Create a Custom Sequence in Premiere Pro

Creating a custom sequence is like tailoring a shirt to fit you perfectly. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do just that:

### Step 1: Displays the New Sequence Window

Begin by launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once opened, navigate to the top menu and select **_File_ \> _New_ \> _Sequence_**. This will open up the New Sequence window, where all the magic happens!

### Step 2: Change the Editing Mode to Custom in the Settings Panel

You'll see several tabs in the New Sequence window, but we will focus on the **"Settings"** tab for our purposes. Click on it.

Here, you'll find the **'Editing Mode'** dropdown menu. By default, it's set to a specific format like **'DSLR'** or **'AVCHD**.' Change this to 'Custom.' This will unlock a plethora of options for you to play with.

**Deep Dive into Settings:**

1. **Frame Size:** Define your video’s width and height. Remember, 1920x1080 is Full HD, and 3840x2160 is 4K. Choose based on your project needs.
2. **Frame Rate:** 24fps is the cinematic standard, but if you're creating content for TV or web, 30fps or 60fps might be more suitable.
3. **Pixel Aspect Ratio:** Stick with **'Square Pixels'** unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
4. **Fields:** Choose 'No Fields' for progressive footage. If you're unsure, this is a safe bet.
5. **Audio Settings:** Here, you can configure the sample rate, among other things. 48000Hz is standard for video.

### Step 3: Give the New Preset a Name and Save It

Once you've customized the settings to your satisfaction, it's time to save this configuration for future use. At the bottom of the New Sequence window, you’ll see a **'Save Preset'** button. Click on it.

A pop-up window will show up, requesting you to provide a name for your new preset. Choose something descriptive so you can easily recognize it later. Once named, click **'OK'**.

Your custom sequence preset is now saved and will appear under the **'Custom'** folder in the **'Sequence Presets'** tab.

## Part 2: Why Custom Sequence Presets are Essential for Efficient Editing

As you delve deeper into video editing, you'll begin to appreciate the little things that shave off minutes from your workflow, allowing you to dedicate more time to the creative process. This is precisely where the utility of custom sequence presets in Premiere Pro comes into play. But why are these presets so crucial?

* **Consistency Across Projects:** If you’re managing multiple projects or a series of videos, having a standard format ensures that all your content has a uniform look and feel. Consistency is a hallmark of professional-grade content. It's not just about the visuals – maintaining a uniform audio quality and format is equally significant. With a preset, you no longer need to remember the minutiae of each setting, ensuring consistency effortlessly.
* **Speed Up Your Workflow:** Every minute you spend adjusting the sequence settings is a minute less you have for cutting, color correcting, audio mixing, or adding those special effects that make your videos pop. Over time, those minutes can add up to hours. By using a custom sequence preset, you can jump straight into the creative part of editing without the preliminary setup.
* **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Have you ever rendered an entire project only to find that the frame rate was off or the audio was set to the wrong sample rate? These kinds of errors can occur when setting up a new sequence from scratch each time. By relying on a preset, you mitigate the risks of such oversights.
* **Personalized Templates for Different Platforms:** Different platforms may have varying preferred settings. For instance, the ideal video format for YouTube might differ from that of Instagram or TikTok. Instead of Googling these settings each time, you can have a custom sequence preset ready for each platform, ensuring your content is optimized wherever it's destined.
* **Ease of Collaboration:** If you're working as part of a team, having standard sequence presets ensures everyone is on the same page. This is particularly handy when multiple editors are working on different segments of the same project. With custom presets, you're not just aligning sequences but also visions.

Incorporating this practice into your editing routine might initially seem trivial, but its benefits compound with time.

## Part 3: Summary

Creating a custom sequence preset in Adobe Premiere Pro isn’t just about streamlining your workflow – it’s about ensuring consistency across your projects.

By saving your most-used settings, you're creating a base template that can be pulled up any time, granting you more time for the creative process.

Adobe Premiere Pro's interface is designed to make tasks like these intuitive, so even if you're a beginner, with a bit of practice, you'll be creating custom sequence presets like a pro.

* You have to start by importing your video in the import library.
* From the import library, you can click on the video and drag it down below to the timeline.

![adding video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let's dive into it.

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.
* When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.

![add the footage to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-12.png)

##### Step2 Add the text tile

To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.

* Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.
* On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.
* Select the Plain text option.
* You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.
* Select the text title that suits you best.
* After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.

![add the text tile above the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png)

* Our next step would be to add the text.
* **Double-click** on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.
* Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, **"Hello world."**
* You can also adjust the font of your text.
* Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.
* Select the font you desire.

![type in the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png)

Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.

##### Step3 Take a snapshot

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

![taking a snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png)

* In the main play screen, you can notice a small **camera icon**.
* This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.
* Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.
* Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.

![snapshot is saved in the import library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:

* Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.
* Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.
* Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.
* If it is **longer** than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.
* If its length is **smaller** than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.

![adjust the length of the snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png)

After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.

##### Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot

To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text's blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.

Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:

* **Double-click** the snapshot.
* If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.
* From default, it would be set to **Normal**. Click on the **Normal**
* It will show a drop-down option.
* Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on **Overlay.**

![change the blending mode to overlay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-18.png)

* And press **OK** in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.

The text can be blended with the background.

* Click on the **Eye icon** to un-hide the video from the timeline.
* Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.

![final preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-19.gif)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.
* When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.

![add the footage to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-12.png)

##### Step2 Add the text tile

* Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.
* On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.
* Select the Plain text option.
* You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.
* Select the text title that suits you best.

![type in the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png)

Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.

##### Step3 Take a snapshot

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

![taking a snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png)

* In the main play screen, you can notice a small **camera icon**.
* This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.
* Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.
* Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.

![snapshot is saved in the import library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:

* Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.
* Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.
* Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.
* If it is **longer** than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.
* If its length is **smaller** than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.

![adjust the length of the snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png)

After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.

##### Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot

To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text's blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.

Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:

* **Double-click** the snapshot.
* If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.
* From default, it would be set to **Normal**. Click on the **Normal**
* It will show a drop-down option.
* Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on **Overlay.**

![change the blending mode to overlay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-18.png)

* And press **OK** in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.

The text can be blended with the background.

* Click on the **Eye icon** to un-hide the video from the timeline.
* Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.

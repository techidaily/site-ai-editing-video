## Create True 3D Text Effects Using After Effects

Every video creator wants to make their videos eye-catching and get the message delivered to the viewers properly. If you have regular graphic elements and texts, your video is not going to be as engaging as expected. That is why video creators always try to include trending and attention-grabbing effects and animations in the video. There is no doubt that 3D animations for texts and titles look really amazing.

Different video editors have different 3D text animations and effects that you can apply to the text on your video and get instantly noticed by your viewers. You can apply 3D text animation on premium video editors like After Effects as well as apply 3D text effect online. We will illustrate how to create stunning 3D text animations with different video editors in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Create True 3D Text Effects using After Effects

After Effects is a premium video editor where you can create true 3D text effect from scratch. First of all, you need to create a new composition and add your text to your video. You have to enable 3D option for the text and add depth and lighting texture to get 3D effect. Therefore, you should first create 3D text effect and thereafter, animate 3D text as per your preference. Here are the steps to create 3D text After Effects easily.

You have successfully created 3D text effect on After Effects. You will now illustrate how to animate the 3D text.

## Part 2\. Create 3D Camera Animation

You have prepared your text with 3D effect, and you can have multiple 3D texts on your video. It is time to animate those 3D texts so that the 3D effect becomes more prominent and the text instantly grabs attention. You do not have to create animation from scratch as there are 3D animation presets available. All you need to do is apply them to your 3D texts and they will start to animate automatically. Besides, you can create 3D camera animation to show the texts from different camera perspectives. Here are the steps to use 3d animated text generator on After Effects.

Step1Once you have created your 3D text effect, go to Effects & Presets panel.

Step2Go to Text> 3D Text and you will see all the different 3D animation presets that you can apply.

![preview 3d text animation presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/preview-3d-text-animation-presets.jpg)

Step3Drag and drop your desired 3D animation directly to 3D text layer.

Step4If you want camera animation on your 3D text, select the Camera layer you already created. Press C to get the Orbit tool to get the starting position of the 3D text. You can also use Dolly tool and Pan & Zoom tool for adjustment.

02 [Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF](#Part 2)

03 [How to Make an Image Background Transparent](#Part 3)

04 [How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?

Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.

Using a transparent background as a brand promotion tool helps to project forward the major highlights of your product with a supportive background image, like the brand logo. This helps the audience to have a general idea of your brand. Apart from this, you can also assure the authenticity and quality of your brand by using a watermark in the background image.

Images with transparent backgrounds are the current promotion trends, owing to their convenient compatibility with any web design and the flexibility to mix with the most diverse color palettes and different elements on the product webpage. These can further be easily rendered in 3D to present realistic product images.

## Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF

Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.

It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.

### 01Compression

Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.

**JPG**

The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.

The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.

**PNG**

This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.

You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.

**GIF**

Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.

### 02Transparency

Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.

**JPG**

The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.

**PNG**

The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.

**GIF**

This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.

While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.

### 03Color

Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.

**JPG**

The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.

**PNG**

The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.

**GIF**

The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.

### 04Animation

Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.

A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.

## Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF

Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.

It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.

### 01Compression

Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.

**JPG**

The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.

The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.

**PNG**

This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.

You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.

**GIF**

Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.

### 02Transparency

Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.

**JPG**

The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.

**PNG**

The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.

**GIF**

This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.

While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.

### 03Color

Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.

**JPG**

The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.

**PNG**

The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.

**GIF**

The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.

### 04Animation

Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.

A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.

Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.

While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.

## Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF

Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.

It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.

### 01Compression

Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.

**JPG**

The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.

The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.

**PNG**

This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.

You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.

**GIF**

Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.

### 02Transparency

Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.

**JPG**

The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.

**PNG**

The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.

**GIF**

This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.

While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.

**Step 4: Background Deletion**

When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.

Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.

In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.

**Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format**

When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.

Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.

To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.

For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.

![Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG)

In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.

![Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG)

Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.

**Step 6: Final Save**

Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.

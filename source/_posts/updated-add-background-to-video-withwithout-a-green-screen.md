You have successfully created 3D text effect on After Effects. You will now illustrate how to animate the 3D text.

## Part 2\. Create 3D Camera Animation

You have prepared your text with 3D effect, and you can have multiple 3D texts on your video. It is time to animate those 3D texts so that the 3D effect becomes more prominent and the text instantly grabs attention. You do not have to create animation from scratch as there are 3D animation presets available. All you need to do is apply them to your 3D texts and they will start to animate automatically. Besides, you can create 3D camera animation to show the texts from different camera perspectives. Here are the steps to use 3d animated text generator on After Effects.

Step1Once you have created your 3D text effect, go to Effects & Presets panel.

Step2Go to Text> 3D Text and you will see all the different 3D animation presets that you can apply.

![preview 3d text animation presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/preview-3d-text-animation-presets.jpg)

Step3Drag and drop your desired 3D animation directly to 3D text layer.

Step4If you want camera animation on your 3D text, select the Camera layer you already created. Press C to get the Orbit tool to get the starting position of the 3D text. You can also use Dolly tool and Pan & Zoom tool for adjustment.

![get start position 3d text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-start-position-3d-text.jpg)

Step5Now add a keyframe on Position option from Transform option to mark the starting point of the animation. Similarly, add another keyframe where you want the animation to end.

![add keyframe position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-keyframe-position.jpg)

Step6Use the Orbit tool, Dolly tool and others to position 3D text as per how you want the animation to end.

## 4 Methods to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora

For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

## How to Film Better in Public - 2024 Guide

Filming in public and different locations can add a new dimension to any video. The possibilities are limitless, from the hustle and bustle of a busy city street to the tranquil beauty of a remote beach.

Suppose you're a new vlogger and want to capture the perfect scene in public. Then this blog is for you. It will explain various tips and tricks to help you create the best videos, regardless of location. So let's start and learn more about how to film better in public!

## Part 1\. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?

While recording in public, you want to avoid setting and holding unnecessary camera gear. That's why you should keep your gear as low-key as possible. The essential shooting gears that you are going to need are as follows:

### A Good Camera

A good camera is essential to record a video in public because it will provide quality footage. It will also allow you to capture more detail and create more engaging videos. But if you use a phone instead, make sure it is the latest iPhone or other with high pixels camera.

![a dslr camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-1.jpg)

### A Tripod

A tripod is essential when recording video in public to ensure that your shots are stable and steady. Without a tripod, your camera can shake and create a distorted, blurry image that can ruin a shot. So having a secure tripod will help you capture professional-looking footage.

![a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-2.jpg)

### A Microphone

A microphone is essential for recording a video in public because it captures the sound in the environment, allowing the video to be recorded with better-quality audio. Without a microphone, the video would be recorded with distorted sound and would likely be challenging to understand.

![a vlogging microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-3.jpg)

Apart from the gear mentioned above, you can also bring an ND filter, extra batteries, and SD cards. Because If the battery runs out or the SD card becomes full, the video recording could be lost. The spare batteries and SD cards help to ensure that the video can be captured uninterrupted. Let's see what we need further.

## Part 2\. What Do You Need to Accomplish With Your Video?

While recording a video in a busy location, you need to accomplish three things with your video to record it better. Which are as follows:

### 1\. Clean Shots

When recording in a busy location, it is essential to try and capture clean shots. It can be done by using a wide-angle lens to get the full shot or zooming in to focus on a particular element.

### 2\. Clean Audio

Getting a clean and clear sound when recording audio in a busy location is essential. A good quality microphone, an audio recorder, or external noise reduction can help minimize background noise and capture the desired audio.

### 3\. Decent Lighting

In a busy location, decent lighting is as important as the other two factors. Look for natural light sources that can provide good light, even illumination. If these are unavailable, consider using portable lighting equipment or lamps to create a more flattering environment.

Now that we know what we need let's see how to make a video.

## Part 3\. How to Get the Best Shot While Filming Outdoor?

Whether you are a vlogger, a YouTuber, or a student filmmaker, shooting a video in a busy area is always a challenge. You must be able to plan and execute your production in a way that minimizes disruption and produces quality footage. By following these instructions, we hope you can make a difference in a shot you record:

##### Step1 Scout the Location

Before recording, visit the location in advance to plan your shots. Take note of potential distractions or noise sources and plan your angles accordingly.

![scouting the location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-4.png)

##### Step2 Choose the correct shooting time

The best time to record a video in a busy location is when the area is less crowded, such as early in the morning or late at night. Avoiding peak times and holidays is also a good idea.

##### Step3 Choose the right angle

Once you get to the location, you must find the right angle.

**Select Background**

Try to find a background that will best capture the atmosphere of the area and minimize any background noise.

![select the background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-5.png)

**Set the frame**

If your frame is too broad, you will face potential distractions that could interfere with your video, such as people walking in and out of the frame.

![setting the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-6.png)

**Set your position**

Instead of getting closer to your talent, get further away and zoom in this way, you leave space for other people in the location, and you can still get your shot!

![zoom in the talent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-7.png)

Try to get your shot and then get out quickly so you don't bother other people trying to get their photos.

## Part 4\. Best Way to Record Audio While Filming Outdoor

Audio is essential to any video production, and recording audio while filming outdoor scenes can be challenging.

Outdoor environments come with more variables to consider, such as wind, traffic noise, and other background noise, that can make capturing clear audio more difficult. Even if you use a high-quality mic, you still have chances of interruption.

If you get any such variable in the video you recorded, you can re-record the audio with the help of **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Let's see how you can do it:

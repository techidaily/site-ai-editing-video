## Part 1 What is the Speech to Text App?

In today’s busy schedules of personal and professional routines, most of us have a common habit of running away from entering lengthy text inputs to adhere specific concerns on smartphones and desktops. It is an obvious fact that given a choice to voice out or type, the former would bag in a considerably higher number of votes.

Having a technology backup, it is now practically possible to convert your voice commands into text with utmost ease, thanks to the advent of reliable speech to text applications. The utility works to transform the words you speak, into an exact text representation, thus saving both, your time and energy. Such applications work on the principle of responding to speech recognition requests and processing the same to render an equitable text output.

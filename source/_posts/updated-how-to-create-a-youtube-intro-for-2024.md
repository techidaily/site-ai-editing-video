## How To Create A YouTube Intro

Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It's a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.

However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.

## 1\. Keep your intro brief

The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.

Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don't have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.

## 2\. Stay in the theme

While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won't be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.

Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you'll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.

## 3\. Make the first 7 seconds count

Although branding is important, it won't guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don't provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.

Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.

Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn't yours or if it's obvious that you're not interested in the subjects you raise.

## 4\. Make a plan

The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don't divide them up into manageable portions, you'll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.

One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.

It's important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don't necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.

## 5\. Include a Call-To-Action

Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won't get as a content creator if you don't ask, and this also applies to YouTube.

After you've written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.

Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you'll come out as uncertain of your goal.

## 6\. Keep it simple

It's simple to assume that more is better when creating a YouTube channel. However, if you're just starting out, the opposite is typically true.

Make a thorough inventory of everything you could include before putting together your YouTube intro. After you've written down everything you can think of, pick down the one or two most crucial elements.

You'll save a lot of time by making your YouTube intro simpler. Additionally, it will make your channel feel more cohesive.

## 7\. Create a stunning intro

For the majority of producers, creating a successful YouTube channel takes years of trial and error. A perfectionist attitude will hold you back in the beginning, especially when it comes to your introduction.

Make a YouTube opening that's decent enough to get you started rather than aiming to create something ideal. You can adjust as needed as your talents advance and your understanding of the path you want to go in deepens.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

01 [Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT](#part1)

03 [How to Use Custom LUTs in Filmora](#part3)

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

## How to Remove Background Noise From Video Sony Vegas

The most popular activity you'll get from video creators is to remove unpleasant noises like rumble or buzz from a final film, whether a promotional video, a short story, a short advertisement, or something else entirely. When mixing and capturing sound effects or even other multimedia design elements, it's typical to have to remove background noises.

Thankfully, there are some techniques for eliminating these background noises. In this guide, I will illustrate how to eliminate background noise on Windows, Mac, and Online.

## **How to Remove Background Noise from Video Sony Vegas?**

Nothing is more frustrating than watching your film's current video footage and hearing excessive background noise. Well, if you're unfamiliar with Vegas Pro, don't worry; we'll show you how to reduce noise with these simple steps.

Here's a quick guide on reducing background noise in Sony Vegas. Follow these techniques to minimize background noise quickly and effectively, leaving you with clear audio:

### **Method #1: Lower the Volume**

Consider lowering the volume of your video. Low-level noise is frequently seen in audio at the lowest volume settings. Simply decrease the general volume levels to fight this, and it may clean any mild, below-the-floor background noise.

Slide down the volume lever in the track to the left to lower the level of all audio occurrences within the track. To equalize the course, press the top of the track and drag the gain level down.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-1.jpg)

### **Method #2: Utilize the Noise Gate Feature**

Reducing the volume and implementing the first method does not always eliminate background noise, so you must explore further.

There may be circumstances where the background noise is louder than the speaker, and decreasing the total volume makes it incomprehensible.

I suggest that you consider the Noise Gate if the background noise is a constant hiss. Noise Gate effectively suppresses sound below a specific volume, and background noise volume is lesser than the audio you want to include in your edit. As a result, using the Noise Gate is the best option.

To use the Noise Gate, go to the Track FX section of the interface and click the Audio FX button. Now select "Noise Gate." The choices for this are now visible. Raise the threshold level; this establishes the total volume quality threshold. The Noise Gate will remove all audio below the threshold.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-2.jpg)

## **Alternative Ways to Remove Background Noise from Video**

The learning curve of Sony Vegas may be a bit too complicated for you; then, there is nothing to worry about because you are in the right place.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-5.jpg)

**Step #2: Detect the Noise Segment**

Locate a portion with pure background noise by zooming in on the track or adjusting the Track Size under the View menu.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-6.jpg)

Choose "Noise Reduction" from the Effect tab, begin with the defaults, and then hit "Get Noise Profile" to have Audacity determine what to filter out based on the specified section.

**Step #3: Eliminate Background Noise with Noise Profile**

Next, select the entire audio track that requires noise reduction, return to the Noise Reduction panels, select how much noise you want to eliminate, and click OK to eliminate the noise. You may use the default settings. Audacity will automatically minimize the noise, and the outcome will be visible on the audio track right away.

**Step #4: Calibrate the Settings**

To address the white noise of your audio, go to Effect and Amplify. To see if the noise has been gone, click "Preview." Click "OK" and then export the denoised clip from Audacity to MP3, WAV, or other codecs.

### **#4:** [Remove the Entire Audio from Video Online Free](https://www.audioremover.com/)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, and Online.**

You can use several online audio removers if you don't want to install apps to eliminate the background noise. For example, I discovered AudioRemover.com, a free online audio extractor. In just two actions, you may eradicate audio from video.

1. Choose a video file first, then click the Upload Video button below. Depending on the size of the video, this could take some time.
2. Click the download file to save it to your PC after it's finished.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-10.jpg)

On the other hand, this online audio remover will eliminate all of your audio, background noise, narration, music, and sound. A video file can only be 500MB in size. It can play MP4, AVI, MOV, and other video formats.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is the best way to remove background noise from a video?**

I highly recommend using Wondershare Filmora video editor; all you have to do is activate the Denoise feature in the Audio editing window to eliminate the background noise from the video. Furthermore, it will instantly delete the background noise, such as the breeze.

### **Is it possible to eliminate background noise from a video online?**

You certainly can. Background noise can be removed online using online video editors like Veed.

### **How do I get rid of the background noise in a YouTube video?**

To eliminate background audio noise from YouTube videos, you may first have to download the video, then use the Filmora video editor to eliminate the noise with a single click.

**Method #2: Utilize the Noise Gate Feature**

Reducing the volume and implementing the first method does not always eliminate background noise, so you must explore further.

There may be circumstances where the background noise is louder than the speaker, and decreasing the total volume makes it incomprehensible.

I suggest that you consider the Noise Gate if the background noise is a constant hiss. Noise Gate effectively suppresses sound below a specific volume, and background noise volume is lesser than the audio you want to include in your edit. As a result, using the Noise Gate is the best option.

To use the Noise Gate, go to the Track FX section of the interface and click the Audio FX button. Now select "Noise Gate." The choices for this are now visible. Raise the threshold level; this establishes the total volume quality threshold. The Noise Gate will remove all audio below the threshold.

## **Alternative Ways to Remove Background Noise from Video**

The learning curve of Sony Vegas may be a bit too complicated for you; then, there is nothing to worry about because you are in the right place. In this article, I also prepared a few alternative ways that you can use to remove background noises from your video. Let's skip the talk and start learning:

### **#1:** [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **– Overall Best**

**It is available on Windows and Mac.**

Although there are many applications available for removing background noise, experts recommend Wondershare Filmora Video Editor. Let's get right to the point.

Aside from the standard audio editing tools, Filmora now includes better wavelengths, volume keyframing, peak detection, and audio fades, resulting in a higher-quality audio editing interface. Here are some of the trump cards of using Filmora to remove background audio noise:

* Waveform audio editing with adjustable track height
* Remove background noise with ONE click using the Denoise function.
* Adjust the Denoise level to Weak, Mid, or Strong for improved noise reduction outcomes.

Here's a guide on how to use Filmora to improve video footage, including how to eliminate background noise:

1. In the Wondershare Filmora timeline panel, upload your clip. Trim and erase the video sections that you don't wish to keep.
2. Hover over the Audio option after right-clicking the clip in the timeline. The four choices available are silence detection, modification audio, removal audio, and mute. Select the "Audio Detach" feature to extract the audio from the video.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-3.jpg)

1. Double-click on the audio file and select "Remove background noise" in the Edit Menu to eliminate the background noise instantly. You may also reach the Editing panel by double-clicking the video in the timeline without removing audio from the video and switching to the Audio page to edit audio and remove noise.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-4.jpg)

1. You may also use the Equalizer tool to fine-tune the audio to make it seem more authentic. Simply tweak the music to fit the visual frame by frame if you want a better assessment. After analyzing the results, click Export to save the noise-reduced clip to your device or share it immediately to YouTube or Vimeo.

### **#2:** [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.**

Audacity is a free, accessible, high-quality audio editing program that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You may use it to record live audio, modify it with capabilities like a cut, copy, and paste, and visualize advanced audio analysis using the Spectrogram view mode.You may also use it to eliminate background noise from your audio or video files for free.

The improved detailed instructions for removing background noise in Audacity in 2022 are listed below:

**Step #1: Import Files to Audacity**

Move to the File menu and hit Open or Import after running the program to load the audio or video source into Audacity. Before editing, Audacity will prompt you to make a copy of the audio track. This impresses me as extremely thoughtful. If you want to import a video file into Audacity, you'll have to download and install FFmpeg Library beforehand. Otherwise, you'll need to separate the audio from the video or transcode the video to a suitable audio format.

## Things To Know Before Editing

Let us be honest, most shortcuts are not available without the keyboard. To counter that, our approach will need to be more general. **General** here means you need to know all the necessary controls and panels.

![different controls and panels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-1.gif)

### Take the challenge and find a solution together

To counter these difficulties, even if you have a keyboard, you can imagine yourself in a situation. A situation in which we have a keyboard but will not be using it.

Therefore, presenting us with a challenge, so if you someday come across a situation like this, you will be prepared. All in all, you would be learning more things by returning to the roots of your practice, which in most cases, can prove helpful.

## Get Ready With the Professional Editing Tool

Before getting into the editing process handicapped from resources, you need to be familiar with the software that we will use. We will use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) You can click the link below and catch it up.

![buying wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-2.gif)

## Create a Music Video Without a Keyboard

Let us get started! Whether you have a real mouseless experience or want to take it as a challenge, let's get the things clear first.

* We need to create a **20 seconds** music video.
* We will only be using the footage from the **stock library**.
* We will be using music from the **Wondershare** Filmora **library**.
* We will have 5 minutes to **review** the footage and the music available.
* And most importantly, we don’t have a **keyboard**.

Step 1\. Review your footage

Our first and most crucial step will be to use our imagination and creativity. So get those neurons firing, and let us go!

![reviewing the footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-3.gif)

* Head to the **stock media** folder on the bar mentioned above, the Wondershare Filmora.
* Or you can simply look towards the left window, where you will find the sample **videos tab.**
* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.
* Here you will find almost more than **20 videos.**
* So apart from using the actual recorded footage, we will work our way with what we have from **default**.
* For the music, we would be scrolling in the **stock audio library.**
* Click on the **audio tab** above and start **scrolling**.
* You will also find some categories in the **left window**.
* Choose the category of your choice and **listen** to the audio.

Do whatever suit you best. Keep in mind you only have 5 minutes.

Step 2\. Pick music for your clips

Suppose you have found audio that speaks your vibe. The next step would be to find a video that tallies that audio. Let us suppose we have audio that is of the hip-hop genre. Let that creativity shine now!

![drone shot of rooftops](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-4.gif)

If you like to add a more **classical vibe**, pick a classical song or audio from the audio library.

* After picking the song, move on to the sample videos tab and search for videos that match a **classic vibe.**
* Now random **close-up shots** of a piano, cinematic footage of a big **orchestra**, or simple landscapes with minimalistic movement while focusing on a single object, consider the example below.

![still shot of a bench](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-5.gif)

Now that a scenario is constructed, our next step is to arrange these clips in the Wondershare Filmora timeline.

Step 3\. Download the clips and audio

**You have 15 minutes to create the music video. Start the timer!** Once you have selected a sample video and audio that matches your scenario, you can **download** them from the bottom right icon on the thumbnail. Only if you still need to download them.

Step 4\. Insert the audio into the timeline

* The first step is to drag the audio to the **timeline**.
* Now play the **audio** from the start. If you can work with the audio as a whole, then it's perfect.

If you want your audio to **start** at a certain point. You have to follow the below-mentioned steps. It is as simple as that!

![splitting the audio on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-6.gif)

* **Add** your audio to the timeline.
* Then move the **timer** or the slider where you want your audio to start.
* **Right-click** on the audio file. Select split.
* Your audio file will split into two parts.
* Delete the prior file and drag the file ahead to the start of the timeline.

The next step is to add the videos to the timeline.

Step 5\. Add the video to the timeline

When you have your audio in the timeline, your next step is adding the video. After you have trimmed or split your audio to your wish, follow the below steps.

![adding sample videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-7.gif)

* **Click** and **drag** to drop the video clips where you want the video to start.
* **Play** the audio first is a good feature for where you want your video to insert.
* Then adjust the **timeline** slider on that point.
* Simply drag your video and drop it into the timeline.

**Note:** now, remember you have multiple videos to match the audio length as we create a music video. The more, the more optimistic. Now, remember you have multiple videos to match the audio length as we create a music video. The more, the more optimistic.

Download the remaining videos that you would wish to be added to the music and follow the steps mentioned above to add the clips where you desire.

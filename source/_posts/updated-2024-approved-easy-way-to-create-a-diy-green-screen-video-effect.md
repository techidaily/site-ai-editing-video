## Easy Way to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect

No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.

All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.

## What Is Green Screen Technique?

A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.

Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.

Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.

## Why Use Green Screen Technique?

The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.

Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.

You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.

## How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?

If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.

* A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.
* A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.
* External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.

Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop

Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.

When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.

Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.

Step 2: Setup Camera and Light

Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.

Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.

Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect

There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Speed Up and Slow Down a Video

Speeding and slowing down the speed of a video is a marvel in the video editing world. In the older days, this feat was accomplished only by the big-budget filming industry.

This article will dive into how you can access the modern-day features available in video editing software. From these features, you can alter the speed of your video easily. However, before we get into the step-by-step guide, let's understand what fast and slow-mo videos are.

## Part 1\. What Are Fast and Slow Motion Videos?

As the name suggests, fast-motion videos are the ones that have been sped up from their average speed.

![difference between normal and fast speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-1.gif)

Similarly, slow-motion videos are the ones that have been slowed down from their average speed. The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.

![difference between normal speed and slow speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-2.gif)

Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are. Let's understand their applications. Or how you can use them in your videos. Scroll below to learn more!

## Part 2\. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

The answer to this question would be that it's a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.

### Fast Motion Videos

Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.

The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.

The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.

### Slow Motion Videos

You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.

A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first **Matrix** film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.

![famous bullet dodging scene in the matrix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-3.png)

You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.

Before we get into the editing process, let's first understand what you will need to change the speed of your videos!

## Part 3\. What Will You Need to Change the Speed of Your Videos?

You will need the following essentials to change the speed of a video:

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

To begin, you will need a good video editor. Wondershare Filmora is the best video editing software available. It has a very engaging system UI that allows inexperienced users to learn how to use it quickly. It also has a diverse collection of stock media. And not only that! It allows you to access reliable features to change the speed of a video.

### 2\. Video Clips

Well, it is evident that to change the speed of your videos, you will need video clips. But there are a few things you can keep in mind before adjusting the speed of a video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.

## Part 4\. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:

* The speed adjustment panel.
* Duration panel settings.

Let's get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.

### 1\. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel

The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.

You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.

But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!

##### Step1 Download Filmora

First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.

##### Step2 Import The Video Files

The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and select the **Import** icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.

You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:

* **Drag** the cursor to select the video clips you want.

![import video clips by drag and drop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png)

Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the **Mp4**,   **AVI**, **MOV**, **GIFs,** and more.

##### Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline

After you've imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:

* **Drag** the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, **insert** them into the timeline.

![wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png)

Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.

##### Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel

The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:

* **Double-click** on the video clip.
* In the **pop-up** column, scroll down till you see the **Unifrom Speed** option and click on it.
* The speed controls will be shown in the import window.

![wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png)

In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.

**1.00** is always the average speed. **0.5** being half and **2.00** being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:

* **To increase the speed:** Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.
* **To decrease the speed:** Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.

The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.

![wondershare filmoa opening the speed adjustment panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-9.png)

These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let's move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.

### 2\. Change Speed via the Duration Panel

The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.

This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.

It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.

Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.

##### Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline

After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and click the **Import** icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.
* Choose the videos to be edited, then click **OK**.

Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:

* Drag the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, insert them into the timeline.

You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.

##### Step2 Open The Duration Panel

The Duration Panel comes attached to the **Unifrom Speed Panel**. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.
* In the pop column, scroll below to **Unifrom Speed**.

It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.

##### Step3 Change The Speed of The Video

In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to **reduce** the speed of your video, you have to **increase** the duration of your video. Similarly, if you're going to **increase** the speed of your video, you would have to **decrease** the duration.

##### Slow Down The Video

To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:

* In The Duration Panel, **Increase** the time of the video.
* Type in a number bigger than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If the average speed of the video is **00:01:00:00,** increasing the value of the duration to **00:02:00:00** will reduce the speed of your video by half.

![wondershare filmora adjusting slowing down the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-17.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.

## Part 4\. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:

* The speed adjustment panel.
* Duration panel settings.

Let's get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.

### 1\. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel

The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.

You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.

But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!

##### Step1 Download Filmora

First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.

##### Step2 Import The Video Files

The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and select the **Import** icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.
* It takes you to your computer's library.
* Select the videos to be edited and then click **OK**.

![wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-5.png)

You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:

* **Drag** the cursor to select the video clips you want.
* Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.

![import video clips by drag and drop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png)

Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the **Mp4**,   **AVI**, **MOV**, **GIFs,** and more.

After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!

##### Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline

After you've imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:

* **Drag** the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, **insert** them into the timeline.

![wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png)

Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.

##### Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel

The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:

* **Double-click** on the video clip.
* In the **pop-up** column, scroll down till you see the **Unifrom Speed** option and click on it.
* The speed controls will be shown in the import window.

![wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png)

In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.

**1.00** is always the average speed. **0.5** being half and **2.00** being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:

* **To increase the speed:** Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.
* **To decrease the speed:** Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.

The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.

![wondershare filmoa opening the speed adjustment panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-9.png)

##### Step5 Detach The Audio

* **Double-click** on the audio file.
* A settings menu will open in the import window.
* Adjust the **Fade** options for your Audio.
* Drag the **Fade out** slider to the right to Fade out your Audio.

![wondershare filmora adjusting detached audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-11.png)

You can also remove the background noise and the pitch of the audio if you want. You can also replace the video's original audio with a new one. Click on the audio file and press **Del** on the keyboard to delete it. To add new audio, do as mentioned ahead:

* Click on The **Audio** icon above the import window.
* Browse The Audio that matches the vibe of your video.
* Drag and drop it below your video clip.

![wondershare filmora adding custom audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-12.png)

Doing so would have created alternate audio for your video. Play the video from the start and confirm your changes.

##### Step6 Save Your Project

Saving a project on Filmora is straightforward. First, you need a few steps to proceed with it. Then, when you are done making changes to the video, simply follow as guided ahead, and you'll be good to go.

These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let's move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.

### 2\. Change Speed via the Duration Panel

The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.

This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.

It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.

Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.

##### Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline

After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and click the **Import** icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.

* Then, insert them into the timeline.

You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.

##### Step2 Open The Duration Panel

The Duration Panel comes attached to the **Unifrom Speed Panel**. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.
* In the pop column, scroll below to **Unifrom Speed**.

It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.

##### Step3 Change The Speed of The Video

In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to **reduce** the speed of your video, you have to **increase** the duration of your video. Similarly, if you're going to **increase** the speed of your video, you would have to **decrease** the duration.

##### Slow Down The Video

To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:

* In The Duration Panel, **Increase** the time of the video.
* Type in a number bigger than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

## Guide on VHS Technology and Its Influence on Video Editing

Videos are a person's crucial and cherished memory, and no one wants to compromise their quality. People tend to rely on several effects to exceed the quality of the beloved videos. VHS is the most used effect, popular in professional and personal videos. It stands for “Video Home System” and is often integrated with noises, color bleeding, and smooth glitches.

With **VHS-style** videos, you can not only make videos more high-class but can also intuitively define their worth. If you are new to this field, you should get familiar with the VHS effects in video. This context will provide basic information about **VHS tapes** and how to add VHS effects to videos.

## Part 1: What Is VHS Technology? An Overview of the 70s Sensation

From definition to usability, every piece of information plays an important role in your videography journey. Don't worry if you don't have video editing skills or know what **VHS means**. This section will provide you with reliable information about this:

### What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?

VHS, also known as Video Home System, are the auditory artifacts and visual glitches you see in the pictures. It creates a sense of distortion in the video, making the viewer think the camera equipment is malfunctioning. From the 1980s to the 1990s, this effect gained considerable popularity among video creators and viewers.

In recent years, retro lovers have brought this intuitive effect again into a trend to create a perfect flashback scene. The nostalgic and vintage appeal of these effects is insane. VHS is not just one effect because it divides into further categories. You are also free to select the VHS effects according to the theme of your video and the scene you are going to create.

### Key Aspects of The VHS Effects

Several key aspects are crucial to making high-quality VHS effects in the videos. You can see some of the key aspects listed and discussed here:

* **Tracking Lines of VHS:**The **VHS tapes** are integrated with magnetic strips to sort audio and video signals. However, over time, these tapes degraded, leading to glitches in playback with noticeable distortion.
* **Video Color Bleeding:**You must have noticed that color is bleeding in the VHS videos. In this, the colors in the videos are quite smudged and mixed. This together adds the unique yet smoother distortion in the videos.
* **Vintage and Glitching:**Vintage and glitches are essential to videos with VHS effects. This was initially caused by the limitations of playback equipment and signal interference. At this time, people add **glitch VHS** to the videos in a manual manner to add a sense of interference in the scene.
* **Noise and Jitters:**VHS tapes are known to be susceptible to wrappings and jitters. It causes a slightly unstable effect in the videos in the form of distorted objects. Moreover, the grainy and noisy appearance due to analog recording technology is also a part of this effect.

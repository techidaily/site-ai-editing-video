## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1

#### 2\. Select the video you want and put it on the timeline

#### 3\. Premiere luts are accessible from two sections of the program

Alternatively, you can get them by accessing the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Section of the Effects Control Panel.

#### 4\. Then, open the Input LUT dropdown menu and choose the premiere lut you want

Adobe Premiere Pro has preset input LUTs. However, you can also add your own by clicking browse. Doing so opens your computer’s File Explorer and you can locate your custom premiere luts. The software applies the premiere lut, after which you can use the tools to make adjustments.

Additionally, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to install custom LUT files to use. Below is the process for macOS users.

1. Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative

1. Follow the above process through to step 5.
2. Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.
3. Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.

Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.
5. Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:  
.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.

01 [How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?](#part1)

02 [How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?](#part2)

03 [How to save and export your LUTS?](#part3)

## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Now that you are aware of how the program classifies the Luts, here is how you can correct your footage.

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1  
iv. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.0

#### 2\. Select the video you want and put it on the timeline

![use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-2.jpeg)

#### 3\. Premiere luts are accessible from two sections of the program

Input luts are available under the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Panel as above.

Alternatively, you can get them by accessing the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Section of the Effects Control Panel.

#### 4\. Then, open the Input LUT dropdown menu and choose the premiere lut you want

Adobe Premiere Pro has preset input LUTs. However, you can also add your own by clicking browse. Doing so opens your computer’s File Explorer and you can locate your custom premiere luts. The software applies the premiere lut, after which you can use the tools to make adjustments.

Additionally, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to install custom LUT files to use. Below is the process for macOS users.

1. Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Technical

Adobe Premiere Pro accepts .look and .cube file types, allowing you more creative freedom. Additionally, you can save and export any custom premiere luts to use in other projects. The next section offers a step-by-step guide on how to do that.

Finally, Looks allow you to make quick adjustments to your videos using the presets available on the Lumetri Panel. You can access these from the Effects Panel. Furthermore, it also allows you to preview the result. The intensity of the look can vary depending on where the slider is on the effects panel.

## How to save and export your LUTS?

Most filmmakers prefer to save their premier luts for later use. Here is how to do it:

1. Follow the above process through to step 5.
2. Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.
3. Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.
4. You can save custom luts in the following ways:  
Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.  
Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.
5. Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:  
.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.  
.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.

## Step-By-Step Guide To Creating Halftone Effects In Photoshop

Halftone is a technique that uses dots to create a deliberate screen-like image and textured effect. In recent years, it has become trendy in digital design.

This effect is often used in magazines, newspapers, and other printed materials. When applied correctly, it can add depth and dimension to an image, resulting in a softer, more pleasing, and appealing look.

So, if you have ever wanted to add interesting effects and textures to your images, but weren't sure where to start, then keep on reading to discover and learn everything you need to know regarding **creating the halftone printing effect in Photoshop.**

Without further ado, let’s get started!

## What Are Halftone Effects?

Before we know [how to create a halftone effect in Photoshop](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let's have a basic understanding of it first.

In the 19th century, William Henry Fox Talbot introduced the **halftone screen printing** effect to create the illusion of tones in black and white images.

The halftone originated from printers who previously only worked with cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ([CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel)). The solid colors were tiny dots placed together closely with continuous tones that remained unchanged. From the mixing and matching of these four colors, a wide range of colors emerged.

The effect is usually created by putting dots of ink on paper in different sizes and positions. This illusion uses optical bleeding to make the desired impression on the human eye. These color dots act like analog **pixels** that result in a recognizable image.

For instance, when you look at a pixelated picture and zoom it, you will see missing details. When you zoom out, the photo gets more minor and back to its original form.

### Modern Definition and Usage

In the 21st century, the halftone is a static-visual technique applied in print and digital images to create continuous tone imagery using dots that vary in spacing and size to create a gradient effect.

Halftone produces a deliberate screen-like image distortion in different fields, such as pop art, graphic designing, and screen printing, to create nostalgic or vintage effects and make the images more captivating.

## How To Use Photoshop To Create Halftone Printing Effect

Below we’ve provided detailed step-by-step guidance on creating a color halftone effect as well as black and white halftone printing effects in Photoshop:

### 1\. How to Create Color Halftone Effect

If you want to create a color halftone effect in Photoshop, do the following steps in a sequence:

Step1 Launch the **Photoshop** software on your laptop/desktop, and drag and drop the image file on which you want to apply the Halftone effect.

Step2 Click **“Filters”** in the top toolbar and select the **“Pixelate”** option from the drop-down menu.

Step3 Click the **“Color Halftone”** option from the menu. On the new pop-up window, adjust the radius and channel to configure the appearance of the effect.

![creating color halftone effect in photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/creating-color-halftone-effect-in-photoshop.png)

That’s about it! You have successfully created the color halftone effect in Photoshop.

### 2\. How to Create Black and White Halftone Effect

Follow these steps to **create black and white halftone printing effect:**

Step1 Open your image in **Adobe Photoshop** and click the **“Image”** option from the top taskbar.

Step2 Now, click the **“Mode”** option from the drop-down menu and select **“Greyscale”** to convert your RGB image.

![select greyscale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/changing-rgb-image-to-grey-scale-to-create-black-and-white-halftone-effect.png)

Step3 Again, open the image menu and click the **“Mode”** option. From the drop-down options, click **“Bitmap…”**

![click the mode option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/setting-bitmap-to-create-halftone-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step4 A dialogue box will open. Set the resolution to 1000, 1,500, or 2,000ppi to create smooth edges on your halftone. Next, click **“Halftone Screen…”** under the **“Method”** header and click **“OK”** to proceed further.

Now, you can adjust the frequency (Lines/Inch), angle (Degrees), and shape (Circle, Line, Cross, etc.) to determine how big your halftone dots are at the maximum diameter and their direction.

Step5 Finally, click **“Files”** from the top taskbar, scroll down, and select **“Save As…”** Save your file as **PSD or TIFF** and import it to **InDesign** to apply color.

### Video Tutorial - How To Create Halftone Effect | Photoshop 2022

To help you better put the guidance into practice, we have prepared a video tutorial to deepen your understanding.

## Two Concepts You Should Know In Creating Halftone Effect

Apart from the practical guidance, there are two important concepts you need to be aware of: radius and channels. Below, we’ve discussed both of them in detail to make things more understandable to you:

### 1\. Radius

Radius refers to the size of the dots that make up the halftone image and is an important factor in determining the overall look of the photo.

You can adjust the sizes of the dots to change the gradient, spacing in between, and blur of the color and image. However, if you want a more subtle effect, you will need to use a smaller radius. For a more dramatic effect, like vintage comics, old ads, or DIY grunge zines., you will need to use a larger radius.

### 2\. Channel

Channel refers to the number of values that are used to create the image. The more values you use, the more details will be visible.

The Channel setting of halftone effects affects how the dots are positioned and overlap. Each Channel is governed by a Screen Angle setting, which is listed in degrees. Changing the value modifies the angle at which Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black dots are added to the pattern. When the dots overlap, a new color is created depending on the combination of the primary colors and black.

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we've explored the halftone effect, how it originated and discussed its modern definition and usage. We've also provided step-by-step processes to help you create the halftone effect in Photoshop, both colored and black and white.

Furthermore, we discussed two important concepts (radius and channel) of the halftone screen printing effect to help you understand the technique in detail.

## Vintage Film Effect 1990S - How to Make

In the 90s, movie production technology improved a lot. This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological. In fact, we can say that the horror movies of the 90s laid the foundation for current horror movies. So, without wasting time, let's create a 1990s horror movie similar to The Blair Witch Project.

## Preparation ![1990s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1990s-vintage-scene.gif)

The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you've watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It's even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.

How to create a 1990s horror film with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1 Add the horror video to the timeline ![add the horror video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-1.jpg)

Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.

##### Step2 Apply color grading ![apply color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-2.jpg)

Next, double-click the horror clip and go to the **Color** menu. Then, click the **Tone** arrow before lowering the **Saturation** to -50%. This will give us a less saturated look popularly used in horror films.

![double-click the horror clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-3.jpg)

Now click the **3D LUT** option and choose a LUT that works for your film. For this horror film project, we'll select the **Dark Film** option.

##### Step3 Add creepiness to the video ![add creepiness to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-4.jpg)

Obviously, you'll want your horror film to look as creepy as possible. To achieve that, click the **Elements** tab, then search for the **Smokescreen 1** effect. Move the effect to the timeline above the video track before trimming the effect clip to fit with the original horror video.

We'll now change the size and positioning of the smokescreen effect to match the feature video. To do that, double-click the effect track. You can also reduce the opacity to around 30% to make the smoke more visible.

##### Step4 Add a retro filming effect ![add a retro filming effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-6.jpg)

Now we'll make the film more believable by adding a retro overlay. Click the **Effects** tab, then search for **Retro Film Overlay 15** before dragging and dropping the effect above all the tracks in the editing timeline.

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.

Part 1\. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking

We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let's quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,

Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion  
Add text or solids as additional compositional elements  
Add 3D elements to 2D footage  
Use effects or color gradation methods  
Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television

These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.

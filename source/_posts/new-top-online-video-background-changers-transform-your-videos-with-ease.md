## [Tutorial] How To Add Motion Blur in Blender?

Motion blur effect, as a terminology, holds great significance in multiple industrial uses. From filmmaking to basic photography, the motion blur effect is consumed as a reality-setting standard, which defines its significance. Many platforms are providing this effect to enhance the creativity of their users. Blender is also known among these software providing such services while designing animations.

We will target a comprehensive guide on **adding motion blur in Blender** using the right way. Therefore, if you seek the appropriate way of adding motion blur in Blender, the following description is for you.

## Part 1: What is Blender?

As we start our discussion, we will review [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a free and open-source software. Following this, we will continue realizing the benefits of adding motion blur through Blender:

### Introduction to Blender

For those unaware of Blender, it is an open-source, free creativity software. You can find it as the perfect designing platform for your 3D content. This software has made itself accessible to the market with ease. This has made it quite famous among professionals, and is recommended for its high-quality, feature-rich design. From modeling to sculpting, Blender provides some great options to work with.

If you are up for editing some videos through Blender, it offers a great course of features, including motion blur. This **Blender motion blur tutorial** intends to bring you a similar insight into this great software. This will help you know the procedure of executing such facets to perfection.

![blender interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-1.jpg)

### Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect

There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:

**· Perfect For Idolizing Speed**

The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.

**· Resolves Flickering**

Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.

**· Attenuates Real-Effect**

One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.

## Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?

As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on **how to add motion blur in Blender**:

Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the "Render Properties." Look to enable "Motion Blur" from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.

![enable the motion blur option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg)

Step2 Start by setting its "Position" in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use "Center on Frame." If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the "Shutter" value or vice versa.

![adjust the shutter value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg)

Step3 Following this, define the "Background Separation" according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the "Max Blur" pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.

![set background separation and max blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg)

Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.

## Combining 2 or 3 Videos into 1 Using Photos App on Windows 10

Photos App on Windows 10 empowers you to experiment with the photos and videos to make them look better. It allows you to merge multiple videos and edit the video content, compare videos, and create films. It is easy to use and offers all basic viewing and fixing options.

Follow the step-by-step guide to merge videos using Photos App on Windows 10:

### Step 1: Lauch the Photos App

You might wish to put all of the films or photographs you want to merge into one folder on your computer before going to the Photos app. It will aid in the speeding up of the entire procedure.

Type 'Photos' into your computer's search bar, then click on the program that appears.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-6.jpg)

### Step 2: Start a New Video Project

You want to start your video production after launching the Photos app. To do so, go to the top right corner of your screen and select New Video Project, which will take you to the editor mode.

The second part of this procedure is known by several titles in different versions of Windows 10's Photos app, such as creating a video with music, creating a film with text, and a new video project.

Launching the editor mode directly from the photo if you're using photos in your video project is also possible. In that case, consider the following:

* Open your file in the Photos app
* Select Edit & Create
* Select Create a movie with text from the drop-down menu.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-7.jpg)

You can name the project by typing it in the name tab in the top left corner of your screen. Then, by clicking the pencil icon next to your project's name, you can alter your title at any moment.

The video editor in the Photos app won't allow you to upload files until you've given your project a title. When you try to add a file, a pop-up choice will display, and you may write in the project's name and then click OK or Create a Video to continue.

### Step 3: Import Files

To add files to your video project, go to the Project Library portion of your screen and click the + icon that you see in the top left corner.

If you have all of the files you wish to merge into one video in one folder, you can select them all and add them to your project using the 'This PC' option. Alternatively, you can add the files one by one.

The tool will automatically combine all of your files into a single video. Then, you can alter the video order in the Storyboard and edit them.

Go to your Project Library and drag all of the files you added to the video editor into the Storyboard section to get started on your project.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-8.jpg)

### Step 4: Trim Video Clips

You can also trim your clip in the Photos app if necessary. Here's how to do it:

* On your Storyboard, select the Trim icon.
* Using the handlebar, shorten or prolong the duration of your clip as desired.
* Select "Done" from the drop-down menu.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-9.jpg)

### Step 5: Remove/Add Sound

You can now select numerous music options from the Windows library or upload your own.

Select the Background Music option in the top-right corner of the screen. Then, mute or adjust the volume of your video.

Or select Add an audio file from the Custom Audio menu in the top-right corner of your screen, select the file you want to Import, click Open, make any necessary changes to the audio file, and select Done.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-10.jpg)

### Step 6: Add Text

You can add text to your video project using the Windows video editor, but there aren't many font styles to choose from. You'll also have to add and optimize your text for each clip separately, which isn't the most time-efficient approach.

To add text to your clips, follow these steps:

* Choose Text
* Select the small box icon on the clip you want to add text to
* In the empty box, type the text you wish to add.
* Select the font style you want to use.
* Choose where your text should show in the video.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-11.jpg)

### Step 7: Export/Save Merged File

You can save your video project to your computer after being happy with it. To do so, follow these steps:

* Click the Export, Share, or Finish movie option in the top right corner of your screen.
* Select the video resolution in which you want your video to be saved.

Once the process is completed, you can export your merged video files to any platform you like.

## FAQs

### Q1\. How to merge two MP4 videos into 1?

Whether you have two MP4 clips or videos with different extensions, you can easily merge them into one with Filmora. To do that, position both videos on the same track without space. Then, export the project in your desired output format, such as MP4.

### Q2\. What is the best app for combining videos?

For fast video joining, you can choose Filmora or Adobe Premiere Pro. Both apps are available on Windows and Mac operating systems. Moreover, the combining process is also trouble-free.

### Q3\. How to merge two videos without losing quality?

Professionals with years of video editing experience choose Premiere Pro to maintain the quality of the merged videos. But remember, any mistakes in the export settings can reduce the calibre.

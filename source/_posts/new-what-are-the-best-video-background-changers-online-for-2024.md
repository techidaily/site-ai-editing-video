## What Are the Best Video Background Changers Online?

Popular Trends in the creative space engendered the creation of several tools that have reduced the difficulties involved in content creation. A few years ago, executing simple post-production tricks was a huge task. Simple edits like changing video backgrounds needed an expensive light setup and a proper green/blue screen background.

## **What is a Video Background Changer?**

A video background changer is a tool that can swap the background of any video. These tools usually work in three simple steps.

* Analyze the footage.
* Separate the subject or “subjects” from the background
* Switch backgrounds.

The process starts when a user uploads a video clip. The tool analyzes the footage and separates the subjects from the background. The user can select other available pre-made backgrounds or upload a preferred one to the platform. After this process, users can share the finished video or save it to their devices. Other kinds of background changers only merge a transparent clip with a background.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

Xilisoft Video Cutter is an effective programming cutter that lets you choose and cut your preferred segments in a single file as well as cut out the segments you don't like. It is compatible with almost all popular video formats, including VCD, AVI, MPEG, MP4, WMV, 3GP, /MPEG-4 AVC, /PSP AVC, MOV, ASF, and others. It enables you to precisely set the start and end points.

While the software cannot cut segments from multiple input files at the same time, it can cut your selected source video into the number of clips you require in a single step. Xilisoft Video Cutter goes beyond standard cutting or slicing by allowing you to convert your video input files to a variety of well-known codecs. It is possible to convert the entire source file or just a specific segment, but this requires removing those unnecessary parts that frequently cause problems (TV advertisements, trailers, etc.).

**Features:**

Easily Cut Video Clips

Multi-trim Video to Whole

Output Clips to Multiple Formats

Instant Preview

Clear Timeline

Advanced Editing

1-2-3 Interface

Multilingual Interface

**Pros:**

Supports all of the most widely used video file formats

Converts your videos between formats

Simple cutting interface

Allows for multiple cuttings from a single source file

**Cons:**

**Steps On How To Cut Your Favored Segments:**

1. **Add Source Video File**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-42.jpg)

Click the "**Open**" button on the main interface, and select a video file in the pop-up window.

1. **Set Clip Segments**

Click "Play" and click the "Set Start Point" and "Set End Point" buttons successively during playing the video to set the start point and endpoint of the clip.

You can also set several segments. Click the "Show Advanced Mode" button and click the "New Clip" button in advanced mode to set the start and endpoints of the segments. Repeat the above steps to set several segments.

Tip: To delete a segment, please choose the segment in the segment list, and click the "Delete Clip" button on the toolbar; to adjust the segment order, please choose the segment and click the "Move Up" or "Move Down" button to adjust its order.

1. **Output Settings**

Click the "Cut" button at the bottom of the window to open the "Output Settings" window.

1. **Start Cutting**

Click the "OK" button to start video cutting. During cutting, you can check the cutting status by dragging the process bar or canceling the cutting. Tip: After cutting is done, click the "Open Output Folder" button to open the destination folder to check the clippings. Click the "Done" button to go back to the main window.

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID VIDEO CUTTER ON MAC?**

Whether you choose Free or Paid Video Cutter, it still depends on your edit and navigation if the project will succeed like what you’re anticipating. Beginners in the industry can go for Free Video Cutters to practice the craft without worrying about the monthly subscription.

However, if you’re a professional, I highly suggest that you choose Paid Video Cutter to lessen the hassle and create amazing output.

**FAQS ABOUT CUTTING VIDEOS**

1. **How can I cut a video without losing quality?**

Trimming VLC through LosslessCut

LosslessCut is an open-source video cutter that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Like Filmora, this software also allows you to cut videos without re-encoding, so there is no loss of quality.

Filmora is one of the best video cutter software that allows you to change the aesthetic of your video with one click. It comes with a wide range of video effects that enable you to make clips look good. Features: This tool provides fast editing processing and adjustable preview quality.

1. **Why does trimming videos reduce quality?**

In most cases, trimming only causes a minor loss of video quality. And there is no clear causal relationship between trimming and losing video quality. The main factors that influence video quality are Resolution, Bitrate, and Frame size.

If you are longing to pick up the best video cutter for Mac, you are supposed to evaluate it from different aspects, like operating interface, cutting features, output quality, post-processing ability, etc. Frankly speaking, there is no fixed answer. Everything depends on your actual requirements. If you want to cut videos on Mac with the forthright method, iMovie can be your top priority. If you prefer top-leading editing features, Blender is competitive enough for you.

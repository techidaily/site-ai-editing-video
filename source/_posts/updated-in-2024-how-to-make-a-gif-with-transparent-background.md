All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle.

How to Make a GIF With Transparent Background?

#### In this article

01 [Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?](#Part 1)

02 [Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

## Top 6 Drones for Videography

Drones are all the rage these days and for good reason. They're a lot of fun to fly, and they can be a great addition to your toolkit for capturing aerial footage. But with so many different drones on the market, it can be tough to know which one is right for you.

![best drone for videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/best-drone-for-videography.jpg)

That's why we've put together this guide to the best drones on the market for every budget. Whether you're looking for an entry-level drone that won't break the bank or a top-of-the-line model that will let you capture stunning 4K footage, we've got you covered. So read on to find the perfect drone for you!

## Buyers Guide: The Best 6 Drones on the Market for Every Budget

**#1\. DJI Air 2S:** Among the best options for most people.

![dji air 2s](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-air-2s.jpg)

The DJI's new Air 2S is our top pick. It finds the ideal compromise in terms of size, weight, picture quality, intelligent features, and price. The camera on the Air 2S isn't as nice as the Mavic 2 Pro's, which has a variable aperture for more flexible shooting in sunny conditions and includes neutral density filters to help make up for it.

1.3 pounds might not seem like much, but the Air 2S is a force to be reckoned with- it's durable enough to fly in light winds and can stay up for 30 minutes! Plus, the new collision-avoidance system will keep you safe even when there are trees around, and the 1 inch 20 mp sensor captures amazing 5K video or still photos.

**#2\. Skydio 2+ Drone:** If you want your flights to be handled automatically.

![skydio 2 drone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/skydio-2-drone.jpg)

The Skydio 2+ has the best collision-avoidance system, far outperforming any other drone on the market. If you want a drone that can follow your mountain bike off-road or quickly maneuver through obstacles without your help, this is it. Its 27-minute flight time and 6-mile range make it restrictions for some people, but plenty for most. The 1/2.3-inch sensor on this camera is good enough for 4K footage at 60 frames per second, but it's not as great as the 1-inch sensor in the Air 2S and Evo Lite+. D-log support is also absent, so video professionals might want to keep that in mind.

However, if you can live without D-log and don't mind the slower sensor, this drone is capable of flying in places where other drones can't. For certain applications, a smaller sensor may be preferable to having a great one.

**#3\. DJI Mini 3 Pro:** The Best Ultralight Drone for Most People

![dji mini 3 pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-3-pro.jpg)

The DJI Mavic Mini 3 Pro is the third version of the name, and it has been greatly improved from its original state. It features a 4K/60p footage with 1/1.3" sensor as well capture 12.1 megapixel RAW photographs. The Mini 3 Pro also has a 48-megapixel mode that improves image quality, but loses some camera functions. A faster F/1.7 lens is now on the front of the drone, and it also incorporates three-direction obstacle avoidance and a gimbal that allows for vertical shooting--all while weighing in at less than 250 grams. This number is important because, in many areas, a drone under 250 grams does not need to be registered (however, you should always check your local laws).

I was ecstatic about the performance of the Mini 3 Pro. It can fly in an impressive 45 minutes when using its extended battery--which is a dramatic improvement from the 32 minutes I got with the standard battery. Not to mention, it's delightful to fly because it maneuvers so effortlessly in even high winds. The only issue I have with it is that its price has risen since DJI released Mini 2; however, they still sell both models.

**#4\. DJI Mini 2:** Most Affordable Drone

![dji mini 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-2.jpg)

The Mavic Air 2S has advanced collision-avoidance tech, but at a high cost. Even the new Mini 3 Pro sells for $750\. If budget is more important to you than features, DJI's Mini 2 would be your best bet. It flies compared to its larger siblings, though wind gusts that wouldn't bother bigger drones like the Mavic 2 Pro will ground the Mini. The lack of collision-avoidance sensors makes it better suited for experienced pilots.

Even with those minor drawbacks, the Mini 2 is still a great beginner drone. It's enjoyable to fly, captures 4K video footage, and can be stored in smaller spaces than many smartphones. And that last part is essential because the best drones are ones that you'll actually bring with you instead of leaving at home. The Mini 2 only weighs 249 grams so it's easy to transport, and you don't even need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration

**#5\. DJI Mavic 3:** The Most Luxurious Drone

![dji mavic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mavic-3.jpg)

The DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a cut above the rest. It's the finest drone on the market right now. The new 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor produces outstanding image and video quality, and 45 miles per hour mobility allows you to follow and track objects without missing a beat.

If you're willing to spend the money, this drone is definitely worth it. It has a 45-minute flying time and can avoid obstacles in all directions. The Cine model also supports Pro Res video and comes with 1TB of storage space- perfect for filmmakers or anyone who wants to capture high-quality footage.

**#6\. Autel Evo Lite+:** Great for Long Flights

![autel evo lite](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/autel-evo-lite.jpg)

The Evo Lite+ is your best bet if you want to stay airborne as long as possible. Its massive battery provides a 40-minute flight duration, and the additional weight makes it more stable in the wind (though not by much). The Evo Lite+ features a fantastic camera with variable aperture controls, a 1-inch sensor, and night mode for better low-light photos.

The control does resemble an Xbox controller, which is nice, but it lacks the storage capacity for detachable joysticks that you get with DJI drones. It's still perfectly functional, and Autel's software will be familiar to anyone who has used a DJI drone.

## Some Final Suggestions

Drones can be used for a variety of purposes, from shooting landscapes and cityscapes to capturing footage of sporting events or outdoor activities. They can also be used for wedding videos, real estate videos, and other types of commercial work. And if you're just looking for some fun footage to add to your home movies, drones are the perfect way to do it.

Of course, not all drones are created equal. If you're looking for a drone that can shoot high-quality video on a budget, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

* First, make sure the drone has a high-resolution camera.
* Second, make sure the drone has a long battery life so that you can get plenty of shots without having to recharge.
* Third, make sure the drone is lightweight and easy to control so that you can get the perfect shot every time.

So, what's the best drone for you? It depends on your budget and your needs. If you want a high-quality camera that can shoot in low light, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a perfect choice. If you're looking for a long-flight drone, the Autel Evo Lite+ is a great option. And if you're just starting out, the DJI Mini 2 is an affordable and easy-to-use drone that anyone can fly. With that said, happy flying!

## Easily Sync Audio With Video With Filmora

Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it's not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

That's why in this brief guide, we'll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio & video when a single camera can record both. So let's first answer this simple question.

## Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio & Video?

Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can't expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That's why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.

You might think it's an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.

![recording audio and video separately for higher quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg)

But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don't do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn't it?

Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let's first see what preparations we need. After that, we'll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let's begin our journey.

## Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording

You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It's to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.

And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.

![a clapper board used to start a film scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/film-start-clapper-board.jpg)

Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It's best to clap before you say "Action" or speak so that it's easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a **Tail Slate**!!!

After you've recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world's leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let's move forward and see how to sync audio with video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![import your media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Prepare your files

Now, it's time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the "Import Media" section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.

![drag the media files to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/drag-the-media-files-to-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step4Sync the audio & video files using the audio spike

Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you'll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we'll see a spike.

**_Bonus Tip:_** _If you can't find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier._

![find the sound spike on video and audio files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg)

Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.

![align the sound spikes with each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/align-the-sound-spikes-with-each-other.jpg)

That's it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let's see how to do it now.

##### Step5Remove the audio from the video footage

To detach the audio in the video footage, right-click on this file and select the "Detach Audio" option. Or you can also use the "Ctrl+Alt+D" as the hotkey.

![detach audio from video file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-from-video-file.jpg)

Once the audio file has been separated, you can move forward and delete it. To delete this audio, right-click on it and select "Delete."

![delete the detached audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/delete-the-detached-audio.jpg)

##### Step6Enjoy your video with the new audio track

So here we go. Our video file has been synced with the high-quality audio file. You can now hit the Export button to get this edited file. But wait a minute. Didn't we say we'll show you a method to automatically sync audio with video? Let's start this method now.

## Part 4: FAQs About Synching Audio With Video

### Is auto synchronization better than manual syncing?

Well, auto synchronization is no doubt easier than manual syncing. But that doesn't mean you don't need the manual process anymore. Many situations may arise where you may be left with no choice but to use the manual syncing of separate audio and video files. So make sure to properly learn both these methods, and each one of them will definitely come in handy someday.

### How can we sync audio & video for free?

Syncing audio and video files for free is not a difficult task. Download the Filmora right now, and after installation, you can freely sync any Audio file with its corresponding video file by using the manual method described above.

## Conclusion

For any video creator, knowing how to sync audio with video is a must. That's because most creators record audio and video separately for higher quality.

This brief guide has covered all the details about how to sync audio and video files using an outstanding video editor, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). We hope it comes in handy.

Moreover, the vast arsenal of video effects, images, short clips, AI avatars, and many other things are also available. You just have to pick out the one you like and add it to your video with just a single click.

On top of that, you can also adjust the audio files like audio ducking, silent detection, audio mixing, and synching audio with the video files.

![wondershare filmora official website interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wondershare-filmora-official-website-interface.jpg)

As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let's start with the manual process first.

### Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora

##### Step1Download & install

If you haven't downloaded the latest version of Filmora yet, click the button below to download it without any cost. And after the download is completed, you can install it on your device right away.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step2Import your files

The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the "New Project" button from the opening interface.

![click on the new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-a-new-project-on-filmora.jpg)

When a new project is created, you'll see an "Import Media" section on it. Click on this section to browse your audio and video files from the computer. Or you can also drag and drop these files here to import them.

![import your media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Prepare your files

Now, it's time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the "Import Media" section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.

![drag the media files to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/drag-the-media-files-to-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step4Sync the audio & video files using the audio spike

Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you'll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we'll see a spike.

**_Bonus Tip:_** _If you can't find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier._

![find the sound spike on video and audio files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg)

Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.

![align the sound spikes with each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/align-the-sound-spikes-with-each-other.jpg)

That's it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let's see how to do it now.

##### Step5Remove the audio from the video footage

To detach the audio in the video footage, right-click on this file and select the "Detach Audio" option. Or you can also use the "Ctrl+Alt+D" as the hotkey.

![detach audio from video file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-from-video-file.jpg)

Once the audio file has been separated, you can move forward and delete it. To delete this audio, right-click on it and select "Delete."

![delete the detached audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/delete-the-detached-audio.jpg)

##### Step6Enjoy your video with the new audio track

So here we go. Our video file has been synced with the high-quality audio file. You can now hit the Export button to get this edited file. But wait a minute. Didn't we say we'll show you a method to automatically sync audio with video? Let's start this method now.

* **Learning curve**: You need to compare the editing software options that you have to determine which one is complex to learn and which one is easy. This will save you the time and effort you would have spent downloading multiple products to test.
* **Quality**: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, and you need to choose the one that supports your video format.
* **Resources**: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor with all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.
* **Compatability**: Check whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you want to use. Consult the internet for compatibility by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.

## How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion  & Free LUTs Resource

LumaFusion is one of the most complex iPad and iPhone video editing apps. Many of its customers adore it, and it has some incredible capabilities that you'd find incompetent editing software. They've effectively opened up the realm of LUTs to iPhone and iPad users.

LumaFusion LUTs are individual files that act as containers in LumaFusion. This container file includes standard LUT data as well as LumaFusion-specific color preset data. A LumaFusion LUT Preset file is similar to a Super LUT. LumaFusion can only employ one standard LUT at a time; however, LumaFusion LUT presets enable simultaneous Color Grading and Color Corrections.

## How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion

Colors in today's cameras are vibrant, but they may continuously be improved. Color correction corrects the color that's already there, whether it's boosting the exposure to brighten a darker photo or increasing the saturation to make the colors pop. Color correction in other NLEs can be difficult, but not in LumaFusion.

The Color Presets tab in the Color & Effects section is where you begin color correcting footage. There are various presets from which to pick. I wouldn't use these settings on my videos because they're too stylized, but they're there. You may alter any of the presets to your taste, so some of the more dramatic ones can be toned down. By picking the original setting, purists can color-fix their raw footage without using LumaFusion. Moving the sliders till the color seems perfect is all that's required from there.

Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, mid-tones, and saturation and hue are all controlled by sliders. The color sliders can be used for a more forceful approach. But proceed with caution. The sliders are delicate, and it's easy to overdo them. Play around with the sliders until you get the look you want. If you don't like it, toss it in the trashcan and start over.

Color grading and color correction are not interchangeable terms. Color correction is a technical requirement, but color grading is primarily creative. You'll have no command over the color grading process if you're working with film material where primary colors aren't even visible. Before diving into the creative LUTs, make sure you complete adequate color correcting.

Color grading, unlike color correction, adjusts the shot's color to modify the atmosphere or feel. The only way to do that in LumaFusion is to play around with the color sliders under the Color Presets tab, but that's not ideal. As previously stated, the three sliders are sensitive and limited. LumaFusion isn't designed for color grading, which is OK. Thankfully, LumaFusion allows you to use LUTs.

Always color correct your footage before utilizing any LUTS, which entails changing the White-balance, Highlights, Contrast, and Shadows. Do not apply the LUTS to your footage directly.

## How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?

Videographers, colorists, and editors use LUTs because they are efficient. Rather than starting from zero every time you work on a video editing project, you may speed up the color grading process using a LUT with predefined color profiles. It's elementary to import LUTs. Simply import the preset files into LumaFusion and add the preset to your footage like an Instagram filter.

The Import button in the Color & Effects editor is the easiest way to load LUTs.

1. Double click on any video/photo clip on the timeline to access the Clip Editors.
2. At the bottom of the Clip Editor UI, select the Color & Effects tab.
3. The import button is located directly below the effect preset library.

## How to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect?

No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.

All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.

## What Is Green Screen Technique?

A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.

Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.

Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.

## Why Use Green Screen Technique?

The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.

Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.

You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.

## How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?

If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.

* A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.
* A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.
* External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.

Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop

Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.

When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.

Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.

Step 2: Setup Camera and Light

Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.

Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.

Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect

There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing. The reason behind the recommendation is that the steps to replace the green screen with any image or video are super simple and anyone can do it. There is no need to be a professional video editor.

## Conclusion

Making videos with DIY green screen stand is no more an esoteric concept. You can set it up anywhere and start shooting video. The magic begins in the post-production stage where you can use Wondershare Filmora to replace the green screen with video effects that will blow the mind of your viewers and followers. Filmora has intuitive options and controls through which you can apply green screen effect in simple steps.

Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop

Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.

When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.

Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.

Step 2: Setup Camera and Light

Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.

Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.

Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect

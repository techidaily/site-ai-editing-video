## Conclusion

In conclusion, a good video depends not only on your camera. There is so much post-production work behind good-quality content. You have to create a feel and ambiance in a video using effects and other overlays. You can create an old-themed video using the right filter and adding a VHS audio effect. Wondershare Filmora provides you with a platform where you can create such content with ease.

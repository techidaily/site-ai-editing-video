## How to Make Video Slow Motion? [Complete Guide]

Slow-motion videos are in trend now, especially when shooting for [Instagram Reels](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), TikTok videos, or [YouTube Shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.

That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.

#### In this article

01 [How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?](#part1)

02 [How to Apply the Smooth Slow-Motion Effect in Post-Production?](#part2)

03 [When to Use Slow Motion?](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences**

Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between **120** FPS and **240** FPS as needed. Tap **1x** from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.

![adjust slow motion zoom level iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-slow-motion-zoom-level-iphone.jpg)

**Step 3: Start and Stop Recording**

Tap the **Record** button from the bottom-center of the screen to begin recording the video in slow motion. Tap **Stop** when you are done. You can access the recorded video from the **Videos** container of the **Photos** app in your iPhone.

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences**

Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between **120** FPS and **240** FPS as needed. Tap **1x** from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.

It has been downloaded over 315 million times by users worldwide. It generates over $50 million in revenue from users.

02 [TikTok Video Tips You Should Know](#Part 2)

## Part 1 TikTok: Brief Definition

Social media is one of the fastest ways to gain popularity. Using TikTok challenges and trends, content creators and businesses can drive their profits, popularity, and high visibility. The app allows users to create, edit and share short videos, which are made more entertaining with filters and music, dancing, and lipsyncing.

Tiktok has a certain prescribed video width and height to make videos. This TikTok ratio allows users to be perceived favorably in the program algorithm. The main reason why users are drawn to TikTok is for entertainment and to foster a sense of community.

The brief 15-60 second videos can offer entertainment for any duration, no matter how short. It remains a popular site frequented by teenagers and young adults. Thanks to the popularity of challenge videos and honest product reviews, it becomes a go-to haven for them. This makes Tiktok an ideal platform for marketing aimed at that demographic.

## Part 2 TikTok Video Tips You Should Know

In TikTok, the video creation editing process goes hand in hand. You can edit a video as you create it. As you start and stop your video, your videos are going to be automatically ‘stitched’ together. This does not mean you can’t trim the videos and edit them after they are made.

Similarly, if you’re not happy with how the video turned out, you can select the backspace button to delete the video on the app. Now let’s dive into the TikTok Video ratios that will make your videos shine.

Another thing that helps you form video ratios for TikTok is to know the audience. The TikTok gender ratio among US viewers is skewed to be 61% female and 39% male.

### 2.1 TikTok Video Format

There is a difference in the specification of videos for android and ios. For example, TikTok allows 72 MB on Android or 287.6 MB in size for iOS. The videos are designed to be viewed on mobile so aiming for vertical videos helps promote your videos on the algorithm.

The frame size for a TikTok video should be 1080 x1920 pixels. This gives the highest quality video output. As a content creator, it is advised to record videos in the .mp4 file format. Ad-creators should look into the .avi and .gif formats for better placements.

You can use premium video editing software like Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos. It offers cutting-edge features like motion tracking, color matching videos, and offering a split screen in the same video. This can help push your creativity to its full potential.

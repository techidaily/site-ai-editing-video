## In This Article, We Introduce You Our Top 5 Picks of Video to Ppt Converter

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

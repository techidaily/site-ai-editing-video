If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.

**Consistency** – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.

**Experiment** – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.

**Out of the Box** – The reason you recommended [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.

**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.

**Meaningful** – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood. Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.

Do you wonder how some pictures or videos look so stunning? As you keep reading you will discover the secrets of achieving similar quality for your content. You need a video or photo-editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and LUTS. Premier Pro luts are file types that you use to make color corrections to your content. They are available in different formats, each with varying capabilities. Below is everything you need to improve your editing skills using Adobe’s software and premiere luts.

![how to use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-1.jpeg)

#### In this article

01 [How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?](#part1)

02 [How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?](#part2)

03 [How to save and export your LUTS?](#part3)

## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Now that you are aware of how the program classifies the Luts, here is how you can correct your footage.

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1  
iv. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.0

#### 2\. Select the video you want and put it on the timeline

![use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-2.jpeg)

#### 3\. Premiere luts are accessible from two sections of the program

Input luts are available under the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Panel as above.

Alternatively, you can get them by accessing the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Section of the Effects Control Panel.

#### 4\. Then, open the Input LUT dropdown menu and choose the premiere lut you want

Adobe Premiere Pro has preset input LUTs. However, you can also add your own by clicking browse. Doing so opens your computer’s File Explorer and you can locate your custom premiere luts. The software applies the premiere lut, after which you can use the tools to make adjustments.

Additionally, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to install custom LUT files to use. Below is the process for macOS users.

1. Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Technical

Adobe Premiere Pro accepts .look and .cube file types, allowing you more creative freedom. Additionally, you can save and export any custom premiere luts to use in other projects. The next section offers a step-by-step guide on how to do that.

Finally, Looks allow you to make quick adjustments to your videos using the presets available on the Lumetri Panel. You can access these from the Effects Panel. Furthermore, it also allows you to preview the result. The intensity of the look can vary depending on where the slider is on the effects panel.

## How to save and export your LUTS?

Most filmmakers prefer to save their premier luts for later use. Here is how to do it:

1. Follow the above process through to step 5.
2. Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.
3. Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.
4. You can save custom luts in the following ways:  
Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.  
Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.
5. Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:  
.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.  
.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.

## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Now that you are aware of how the program classifies the Luts, here is how you can correct your footage.

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1  
iv. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.0

#### 2\. Select the video you want and put it on the timeline

![use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-2.jpeg)

#### 3\. Premiere luts are accessible from two sections of the program

Input luts are available under the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Panel as above.

Alternatively, you can get them by accessing the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Section of the Effects Control Panel.

#### 4\. Then, open the Input LUT dropdown menu and choose the premiere lut you want

Adobe Premiere Pro has preset input LUTs. However, you can also add your own by clicking browse. Doing so opens your computer’s File Explorer and you can locate your custom premiere luts. The software applies the premiere lut, after which you can use the tools to make adjustments.

Additionally, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to install custom LUT files to use. Below is the process for macOS users.

1. Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Technical

Adobe Premiere Pro accepts .look and .cube file types, allowing you more creative freedom. Additionally, you can save and export any custom premiere luts to use in other projects. The next section offers a step-by-step guide on how to do that.

Finally, Looks allow you to make quick adjustments to your videos using the presets available on the Lumetri Panel. You can access these from the Effects Panel.

## A Complete Guide to the Best Brand Story Videos |2023|

With the advent of streaming content accessible anytime, anywhere, conventional marketing has somewhat lost grip on its performance. Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.

However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.

This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their **brand storytelling**. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray **your brand story** than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.

Modern-day consumers are much more educated and sophisticated than before. You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their **branding and storytelling** strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own **brand storytelling video** and are wondering how to make it a successful one.

## Part I. The Most Successful Video Practises of Brand Storytelling

### 1\. Spotify - All Ears On You

Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.

One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk) to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.

**Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:**

* **Get the Most Out of Big Data:** The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.
* **Leverage User-Generated Content:** Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.
* **Utilize The Trending Hashtags &** **Topics**: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.

Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:

* Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms
* Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions

### 2\. Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging

The center of focus of [Airbnb’s brand story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU) revolves around the basic ideology of ‘belonging.’ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can ‘belong anywhere.’

Their official tagline also turned out to be ‘Belong Anywhere,’ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure it’s instantly recognizable.

**Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:**

* **Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization**: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.
* **It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story**: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.
* **Content Is The King:** Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.

### 3\. Apple - Chase

Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.

They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the [iPhone 14 pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk) with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.

Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.

### 4\. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos

If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring [LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FdIAMe1sQno) or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They don’t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.

This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audience’s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.

There’s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - ‘Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:

* They promote the advantages of their product’s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called **benefit-based marketing practice**.

Part I. The Most Successful Video Practises of Brand Storytelling

### 1\. Spotify - All Ears On You

Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.

One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk) to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.

**Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:**

* **Get the Most Out of Big Data:** The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.
* **Leverage User-Generated Content:** Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.
* **Utilize The Trending Hashtags &** **Topics**: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.

Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:

* Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms
* Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions

### 2\. Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging

The center of focus of [Airbnb’s brand story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU) revolves around the basic ideology of ‘belonging.’ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can ‘belong anywhere.’

Their official tagline also turned out to be ‘Belong Anywhere,’ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure it’s instantly recognizable.

**Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:**

* **Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization**: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.
* **It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story**: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.
* **Content Is The King:** Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.

### 3\. Apple - Chase

Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.

They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the [iPhone 14 pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk) with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.

Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.

### 4\. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos

If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring [LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FdIAMe1sQno) or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration.

This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audience’s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.

There’s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - ‘Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:

* They promote the advantages of their product’s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called **benefit-based marketing practice**.
* They **sell brand stories more than their products**, which has always been their primary marketing strategy.
* Nike is very strong in the **social media game**. They leverage user-generated content to create their video ads.

1. **Trimming the video**

After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.

### Steps to Slow Down Video in Filmora

In this section, we will discuss the Filmora Speed Ramping feature to create a slo-mo. If you are a beginner and have never edited before, this feature suits you the best. It has over 6-speed ramping templates for adding creative speed change effects. You can modify these models to fashion a slo-mo, and here is how to do it:

##### Step 1Access the Speed Feature

After opening Filmora and opening a project, select the clip in the timeline and go to the settings panel. From there, reach the "Speed" > "Speed Ramping" tabs and select a preset. If you don't like the featured presets, click on "Customize" for manual editing.

##### Step 2Add Video Frames

Once you have set the slo-mo speed, reach the "AI Frame Interpolation" section at the bottom. Click on the navigation icon and select "Optical Flow" from there.

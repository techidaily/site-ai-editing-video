## How to Make Coin Magic With Filmora

Do you want to become a magician in your videos? Now, everyone can look like a magician with the magic of editing. This article will show you how to do a cool coin trick in [Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 1: What is the filmmaking technique "Cutting on action"

Cutting on action is a technique the editors use to cut in the middle of an action to another shot that matches the first shot's action. Typically, the subject starts an action in one shot and continues the action in another, creating a smooth transition. For example, when you make the coin trick video, you need to cut on the tapping so it can trick the eyes, and the cut won't be noticeable.

## Part 2: Things You Need to Prepare for The Coin Magic Trick

1. Glass and two coins

![glass and coins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-2.jpg)

1. Set the phone on a tripod. Because utilizing a tripod can significantly improve the recording's stability.

![set the phone on a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-3.jpg)

## Part 3: Start Filming

Step1 Firstly, you must show the coin and the bottom of the glass.

![show the coin and the bottom of the glass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-4.png)

Step2 After that, you need to hold the coin with the fingers part of one hand and tap down on the coin. Make sure it looks like the coin is going through straight to the glass.

![hold the coin with the fingers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-5.jpg)

Step3 You need someone else to drop the other coin from the top. Meanwhile, you are pretending to tap a coin on the glass. You don't need to worry about someone else hand in the frame. Since you can remove it easily with the masking feature in Filmora.

![drop the other coin from the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-6.jpg)

Step4 It would help if you had a second shot for a clean plate of the background. You can record background for 20 seconds.

![record background for 20 seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-7.jpg)

## Part 4: Bring the clips into Filmora 11

Step1 If you have not downloaded Filmora, you can visit filmora.wondershare.com to download Filmora's new version.

![download Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-8.jpg)

Step2 Drag and drop the clip onto the first track of the timeline.Afterward, move the playhead to the right and find the spot where you tapped the coin last time before your friend drops the other coin. Additionally, make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action and cut.

![drag and drop the clip onto the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-9.jpg)

Step3 Then move the playhead to the right and find the spot where your friend drops the coin while you tap without the coin in your hand. Make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action, and the position of your hand roughly matches that in the last cut and make a cut.

![move the playhead to the right](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-10.jpg)

Step4 Now you need to delete the middle part and play it back. Indeed, cutting on action is the key to creating the illusion that the action is continued without editing.

![delete the middle part](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-11.jpg)

Step5 Next, you must remove your friend's hand in the frame with the Filmora masking feature. Afterwards. drag and drop the clean plate video onto the second track of the timeline.

![remove your friend's hand in the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-12.jpg)

Step6 Next, double-click the clip to open the setting video. Find the Mask Section and select the single line.

Step7 Here you can see the mask is applied.First, adjust the angle and position of the mask to only show the top part of the frame. Then you have to change the Blur Strength to add more blur to the edge of the mask.

![adjust the angle and position of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-14.jpg)

Step8 With the mask finalized, unhide the first video track and adjust the length of the clip on the timeline. Finally, playback the video and see how it looks.

## Want to Speed up Your Video to Shorten Its Duration and Make It More Entertaining? Here Is How to Speed up Videos in Final Cut Pro. Get a Better Alternative to FCP to Speed up Videos

When there are certain boring but necessary parts in your video, you need to speed them up. Similarly, you may need to reduce the duration of the entire video. Speeding up the video is your only option when you do not want to cut any part. You must have also observed that certain videos look funny when you speed them up. To speed up videos, you will need a video editor that does not degrade the video quality.

Final Cut Pro is a popular choice to speed up video without distorting the pitch. Many think that the video quality can degrade when they change the speed of the video clip. This concern can be taken care of when you alter the video speed with Final Cut Pro. Instead of changing the speed of the entire video, you can change the speed of specific parts. We will illustrate how to speed up the video using Final Cut Pro and suggest a better choice than FCP.

![speed up the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-1.jpg)

## Part I. Speed Up Video using Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro by Apple is one of Mac users' most popular video editors. Many video creators purchase MacBooks for editing their videos in Final Cut Pro. The video editor is suitable for beginners as well as professionals. FCP, as a video editor, is super fast in rendering and processing video while exporting. Here are the steps for the Final Cut Pro speed-up clip.

Step1 Open FCP. Navigate to File>New> and tap Project to start a new project.

![start a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-2.jpg)

Step2 Go to File>Import> Media and fetch your video clip. After that, drag/drop the video clip into the timeline.

![clip into the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-3.jpg)

Step3 Choose the video clip from the timeline. Click on the Speedometer(Retime) icon at the top of the timeline.

![video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-4.jpg)

Step4 Tap the Speedometer icon, to get the drop-drop menu. For the Final Cut Pro speed-up video, go to Fast and select the speed. You get to choose from 2X to 20X.

## Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro

You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.

**Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -**

By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video's speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.

**Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -**

You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project's frame rate.

You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.

![speed up automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

**Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -**

Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.

The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.

## Part III. The Right Final Cut Pro Alternative for Changing Speed - Filmora

Final Cut Pro has a steep learning curve. Unless you have some experience in video editing, you will find the user interface slightly complicated. Besides, Final Cut Pro is only available for Mac users since it is an Apple product.

The speed ramping feature comes with several graphical presets. You can choose from the presets and customize the speed as per your requirements. Check the steps to use speed ramping to change your video speed.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline. Click on the Speed(timer) icon at the top of the timeline.

Step2 Click on Speed Ramping option. This will open Speed Ramping above the timeline.

Changing video speed in Filmora is super easy. You can speed up your video as per your requirements in a number of ways. That is why Filmora happens to be a better option than Final Cut Pro. We will illustrate all the different methods to change video speed in Filmora.

You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII) to understand how to change video speed in Filmora.

### Method 1\. The Simplest Way - Click "2x-100x" Speed Options

Just like Final Cut Pro, you can choose from preset speed options to change video speed. This is undoubtedly the easiest way to change video speed instantly. While Final Cut Pro offers 2X to 20X speed options, Filmora has 2X to 100X speed presets. Here are the steps to speed up video by choosing a preset speed option.

Step1 Download, install and simply Launch Filmora. Tap Create New Project option.

![install and simply launch filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-8.jpg)

Step2 Go to File> Import Media> Import Media Files and choose the video file. The selected video will be imported into the Project Media folder. Alternatively, you can also use the drag/drop function.

![the project media folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-9.jpg)

Step3 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline. Select the video clip from the timeline and click on the Speed (timer icon) option at the top of the timeline. If you want to speed up a portion of the video, you need to split the video clip.

![split the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-10.jpg)

Step4 From the menu, go to Fast and select any speed option as per your requirements. Thereafter, play the video to see the changes.

Step5 Press Export to save the video file in your desired file format.

### Method 2\. Use Uniform Speed to Change Speed

If you want to customize the video speed uniformly, there is a dedicated option called Uniform Speed in Filmora. This means you do not want to choose from the preset speed options. You may want to set the speed of the video to 3X, but it is not available in the preset options.

That is where Uniform Speed comes in handy, and you can set any speed from 0.01X to 100X. Here are the steps to follow.

Step1 Once you have dropped the video file onto the timeline, click on the Speed(timer) icon.

Step2 Click on the Uniform Speed option. This will open the Uniform Speed tab above the timeline.

![uniform speed option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-12.jpg)

Step3 Adjust the speed slider to set the desired speed as per your requirements. The duration will change as per the speed you set, and you can set the duration below the speed slider. Just like Final Cut Pro, you can turn on Ripple and Audio Pitch as per your preference.

Step4 Once you are satisfied with the speed, click on the Ok button. Thereafter, tap Export to save the edited video file.

### Method 3\. Use Speed Ramping to Change Speed

There is a unique way to change your video speed called speed ramping. You can speed up some parts and slow down the other parts, like crests and troughs in a graph.

The speed ramping feature comes with several graphical presets. You can choose from the presets and customize the speed as per your requirements. Check the steps to use speed ramping to change your video speed.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline. Click on the Speed(timer) icon at the top of the timeline.

Step2 Click on Speed Ramping option. This will open Speed Ramping above the timeline.

![click on speed ramping option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-14.jpg)

Step3 Select from the available preset as per your requirements. Otherwise, you can select Customize option and edit the nodes as needed.

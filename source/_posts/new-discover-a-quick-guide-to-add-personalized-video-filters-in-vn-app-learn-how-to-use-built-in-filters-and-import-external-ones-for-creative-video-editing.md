* [Part 4: Summary](#part4)

## Part 1: Use VN App Built-in Video Filters (LUTs)

**_Step 1: Locate the Filters Feature_**

You must know where the magic happens before you go Spielberg on your videos. Upon launching the VN app, you'll see a range of editing tools. Look for an icon resembling a magic wand or palette – your gateway to the wonderful world of video filters.

**_Step 2: Preview and Apply Effects_**

This step is all about experimenting and having fun. Tap on the filter icon, and voilà! You're greeted with various preset looks, waiting for your videos to don them. Glide through the options; VN has got it all from vintage vibes to futuristic glow. Found one that catches your eye?

Tap on it and watch your video transform instantly. Not sure about your pick? No worries; simply swipe left or right to preview other effects. Once you're satisfied, tap 'apply.'

**_Step 3: Adjust Details with Color Settings_**

Okay, young director, you've chosen your filter. But what if you want to tweak it just a bit? VN's got your back.

Once a filter is applied, you'll notice sliders or dials – these are your video filter editor tools. Play around with them! You can adjust the filter's intensity, making it as subtle or dramatic as you like. Tweak the brightness, contrast, and saturation until your video looks like you envisioned.

## Part 2: Download External Filter Installation Package

**_Step 1: Locate the My Filters Feature_**

The VN app is awesome, but can you add even more flair to your videos with custom filters? Yup! These aren't just your regular video presets – they're unique styles you can download and add to your VN arsenal.

To begin, tap on the “My Filters” section within the app. If you're wondering where this is, it's usually nestled beside the built-in filter options, represented by a '+' or 'Add' icon. This personal space is ready to be filled with your downloaded filter goodies.

**_Step 2: Import the Downloaded VN Filter APK_**

Here comes the cool part! To get new custom filters:

1. Visit the website or store where the VN filters are available for download. (**Hint:** Search for “vn filter download APK" or "vn iPhone filter download” based on your device.)
2. Once downloaded, head back to the VN app and click the **'Add'** or '+' icon in the **“My Filters”**
3. Navigate to your device's download folder or wherever the vn filter apk is saved.
4. Select the filter file (it should have a .apk or similar extension for Android users and a different format for iPhone users).
5. Tap on **'Import'** and wait for the magic to happen. Your brand-new filter will now be housed in **“My Filters”**!

**_Step 2: Save the Filter Preset and Use It Directly Next Time_**

After importing your snazzy new filter, the next step is super easy. Simply apply it to your video, and if you love how it looks, save it as a preset. This way, the next time you're editing, you can head straight to **"My Filters**," find your favorite custom filter and slap it onto your video without a hitch. Talk about convenience!

## Part 3: Best Alternatives

Though VN offers many fantastic filter options, it's always nice to have alternatives, right? Meet Filmora, another stellar video editing tool known for its expansive video filter collection.

Filmora is more than just an editor; it's a canvas for videographers. One of its most raved-about features is its extensive range of video filters. With Filmora, you can transport your audience from a sun-kissed beach to a moody, rain-soaked alley in just a tap. Whether you’re going for a documentary feel, a Hollywood movie vibe, or something out of a dream, Filmora's filters have covered you.

**Getting started is a breeze:**

1. Launch Filmora and import your video.
2. Head to the **“Effects”** tab and immerse yourself in the filter options.
3. Preview, select, and apply – it’s that simple!
4. Like VN, Filmora allows you to tweak the filter settings for that perfect look.

While Filmora is a great tool, the best fit depends on personal preferences and specific project needs. However, it's always good to have choices in your editing toolkit. Variety is, after all, the spice of life (and video editing)!

## Part 4: Summary

The beauty of video editing lies in the limitless possibilities it offers. With every video filter, editor tweak, and custom preset, you're not just editing – you're storytelling. And with tools like VN and Filmora at your fingertips, you have everything you need to tell your story your way.

Remember, whether you're a seasoned videographer or someone just starting, there's no 'right' or 'wrong' regarding creativity. Play around, experiment, and, most importantly, have fun with the process. In the vast universe of video editing, every filter is a star waiting to shine on your masterpiece.

## How to Create an Alternate Reality Effect

Ditch boring one-dimensional videos and create a mesmerizing video with this alternative reality effect you can easily create using Wondershare Filmora.

This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?

Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.

![a preview of the alternate reality effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-1.gif)

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

## Editing the video

If you have your footage or stock video ready, then you can start editing. Follow this simple step-by-step guide to create your own alternate reality using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Enhancing the effect with rotation keyframes

Step 1: Double-click the video footage on the first video track to open the **Animation Settings > Customize**.

![move the playhead to the beginning and click add](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-11.gif)

Step 3: Now move the playhead to the end of the video footage and add another keyframe. This time, set the rotation to 20 and adjust the scale number to 115.

![move the playhead to the end and click add](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-12.jpg)

Step 4: Do Steps 1 to 3 to the second video footage. Don't forget to preview the result to see if both footages are rotated properly.

![previewing the result](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-13.gif)

Step 4\. Next comes the adding and editing of the background music. You can either add a song of your choice or can also use a music file from the built-in audio library. Voice-over recordings can also be added to give that extra personal touch. The audio files can also be edited using the supported features of the software.

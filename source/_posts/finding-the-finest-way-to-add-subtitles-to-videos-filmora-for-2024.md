## Part 3\. How to Add Font Effects Online

If you edit videos occasionally and you want to add font effects to your video without downloading any video editor, you can use an online video editor. There are several online video editors you will come across, but for adding free font effects, we recommend FlexClip video editor. It is a completely free online video editor where you can edit and export video without any watermark. There are several elegant font effects available, and you can make easy adjustments instantly. Here are the steps to add font effects to your video.

Step1Open your web browser and visit on “flexclip.com/tools/add-text-to-video”. Click on Browser Video button. Select the video from your storage device.

Step2Once the video is uploaded, you will see Text tab already selected. Go through the list of font effects available. Drag and drop the desired font effect into the video on the Viewer.

## Conclusion

Adding font effects on video is a common practice especially when you have intro and outro in your video clip. Instead of the regular titles and texts, you should opt for creative font effects so that the text parts on your video look attractive. If it is a one-time thing, you can opt for an online video editor. If you use a Mac, you can use iMovie, and for Windows PC, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

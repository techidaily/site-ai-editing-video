You have videos on google photos that are automatically rotated, others are not.

How do you rotate them manually?

It’s is so simple and will not take much of your time.

Let’s dive in…

## **Rotating videos in google photos**

Rotating a video in google photos is pretty simple and will not take much of your time. You can easily fix the rotation and aspect ratio of your videos. But it’s a little tricky.

I'm going to show you how to flip your videos from portrait mode to landscape mode or from landscape mode to portrait mode.

You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you're going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.

**Step 2: Merge FLV files into one…**

At the bottom of this FLV file merger, there lies a **Timeline**.

That’s very important as if you put one video to another, the original video will get split. Also, make sure that all FLV files are placed in the sequence in which they are to be played. If not, you can rearrange any video clip with a simple drag-and-drop.

button, then go to the **"Format" tab > "FLV" output format** in the output window.

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool.

With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.

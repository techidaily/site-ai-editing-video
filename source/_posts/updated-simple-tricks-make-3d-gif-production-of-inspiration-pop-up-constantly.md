## Part 2\. Polishing Your Music Video

Just like ladies apply polish to their nails to make them more attractive, you can use editing to your music video to get the same result. Ladies can go to the beautician if they want. You can go to a professional editor if you like it.

However, these options are pretty expensive. The best way is to do it yourself. It is fun. Also, you can let loose your hidden artist for a while. Stick to the following points to understand how to begin polishing your music video.

### How to put cuts on beats?

Adding beat cuts to a music video is imperative. Randomly placing beats yield an inferior-quality video. It also gives the impression that video editing is not done by a professional. The beats must be adjusted to synchronize with the storyline of the video.

Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.

##### What are the beats?

Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern. They are essential for music videos. It adds attraction for the viewers. Also, without beats, no music video can go viral. In the digital age, beats boost your music video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Cuts are recommended on every 2nd and 4th beat. In that way, a smooth transition of music beats takes place, making it more ear-pleasing. It also gives a professional outlook to the whole music.

Let's learn how you can put cuts on your beats.

##### Step1Import the music video

* Import the Music video to which you would like to add any beat.
* You can also use the one given in Filmora.
* Drag and Drop the music video in the timeline panel.

![importing video in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/importing-video-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step2Detach its audio

* Right-click on the video.
* Select the option "Detach Audio." It will separate the attached audio from the music. You will be able to add cuts where you deem necessary.

![detach audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-in-filmora.jpg)

You can also import audio from your drive. After that, drag and drop the imported file into the timeline panel.

* Right, Click on the audio file in the audio panel.
* Select the option **"Beat Detection."** It will show beats (with red markers) on the audio timeline, making adding cuts to the beat easy.

![beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/beat-detection-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Cut the beats where you find necessary

* Listen carefully to the audio file and plan where you want to add a cut to your beat.

![cutting the beat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/cutting-the-beat-in-filmora.jpg)

* Adjust the beat according to your music video.
* Join the trimmed video segments to maintain continuity. The final product should look like the one given below.

![adjusting cut to the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjusting-cut-to-the-music-video.jpg)

Resultantly, it will readjust the beat to a different spot on the video. You can make multiple cuts in the beats. However, it is not recommended. It makes the whole experience of listening quite jarring.

Once you've added cuts to the beats, it is time to make them smooth. For that, keep reading the instructions given below.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Let us understand from the example given below.

* **Shot 1**: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.

##### What are light leaks?

Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.

Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.

![adjusting blend mode to screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjusting-blend-mode-to-screen.jpg)

##### Step4Fit the effect to the width of the screen

* Click on both circles in front of the Scale option. It will adjust the effect to the entire frame width, giving it a pleasing outlook.

![adjusting the effect to frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-effect-to-frame.jpg)

![final result after light leak effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-result-after-light-leak-effect.gif)

Now, you are done with adding some additional color and light to your cuts. Your cuts are now smooth and trouble-free. Moving onto our next tip that will further polish your music video. It is called Reframing and Zooming.

### Reframe and zoom to polish your video

Another significant feature of Filmora is that it allows you to readjust the frame and zoom of the video. Any zooming option left undone in the shooting phase can be addressed in the editing phase.

## Part 2\. Polishing Your Music Video

Just like ladies apply polish to their nails to make them more attractive, you can use editing to your music video to get the same result. Ladies can go to the beautician if they want. You can go to a professional editor if you like it.

However, these options are pretty expensive. The best way is to do it yourself. It is fun. Also, you can let loose your hidden artist for a while. Stick to the following points to understand how to begin polishing your music video.

### How to put cuts on beats?

Adding beat cuts to a music video is imperative. Randomly placing beats yield an inferior-quality video. It also gives the impression that video editing is not done by a professional. The beats must be adjusted to synchronize with the storyline of the video.

Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.

##### What are the beats?

Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern. They are essential for music videos. It adds attraction for the viewers. Also, without beats, no music video can go viral. In the digital age, beats boost your music video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Cuts are recommended on every 2nd and 4th beat. In that way, a smooth transition of music beats takes place, making it more ear-pleasing. It also gives a professional outlook to the whole music.

Let's learn how you can put cuts on your beats.

##### Step1Import the music video

* Import the Music video to which you would like to add any beat.
* You can also use the one given in Filmora.
* Drag and Drop the music video in the timeline panel.

![importing video in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/importing-video-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step2Detach its audio

* Right-click on the video.
* Select the option "Detach Audio." It will separate the attached audio from the music. You will be able to add cuts where you deem necessary.

![detach audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-in-filmora.jpg)

* Select the option **"Beat Detection."** It will show beats (with red markers) on the audio timeline, making adding cuts to the beat easy.

![beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/beat-detection-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Cut the beats where you find necessary

* Listen carefully to the audio file and plan where you want to add a cut to your beat.

![cutting the beat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/cutting-the-beat-in-filmora.jpg)

* Adjust the beat according to your music video.
* Join the trimmed video segments to maintain continuity. The final product should look like the one given below.

![adjusting cut to the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjusting-cut-to-the-music-video.jpg)

Resultantly, it will readjust the beat to a different spot on the video. You can make multiple cuts in the beats. However, it is not recommended. It makes the whole experience of listening quite jarring.

Once you've added cuts to the beats, it is time to make them smooth. For that, keep reading the instructions given below.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Let us understand from the example given below.

* **Shot 1**: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.

##### What are light leaks?

Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.

Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.

**Steps to Add Fly-in Text Animation in AE:**

Step1 The first step is adding your Title Layer to a Comp that has a colorful backdrop and create a route for the text to follow using the Pen tool.

### 3\. Wiggle Text Animation in After Effects

By using the many effects tools of Adobe After Effects, we may edit any image inside of After Effects. One of them is Wiggle, which you can think of as an effect that aids in introducing vibration to the motion of any object to create motion graphics for a variety of objectives in a specific project.

**Steps to Add Wiggle Text Animation in AE:**

Step1 Go to the menu bar at the top of the working screen, choose Composition from the menu, then modify the composition's parameters to your specifications before clicking the dialog box's Ok button.

![choose composition from menu pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-composition-from-menu-pr.jpg)

Step2 Go to the Window menu on the Menu bar and choose the Wiggler option from the drop-down list to get the Wiggler option. You are free to choose the wiggle value.

## Part 2\. Alternative Way to Add Animation Effects

Without any prior animation skills, this user-friendly program enables you to create animated text for your ads, square recordings, and even Facebook covers.

There are several capabilities included in this free animated text maker program. Additionally, you can combine videos and animated GIFs with your photos to create brief, captivating video posts that you can easily publish on your preferred social media site, notably YouTube. Are you new to [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)? Do not fret! Here, we'll give you a brief introduction to this feature - packed animated text generator, along with clear instructions. Let's start now!

![import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png)

##### Step2 Add Texts and Titles Presets

Select the Annotations tab from the menu on the left side of the screen. Double-clicking the default text will allow you to replace it with your own. You may change the hue and opacity by selecting the properties option on the right side, based on your preferences and how well they go with the movie.

![add texts and titles presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-1.png)

##### Step3 Create Your Animated Text

Adjust your text and lower third length to the longest name or title that will be typed on the same toolbar as the Annotations tab. This makes it possible to maintain a constant text size and length throughout your whole movie. You may modify the layers you've made to suit your preferences and the way your movie flows best.

![create your animated text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/text-animation-win-1.png)

##### Step4 Add Keyframing

Use animated effects and keyframing to give your films life and movement. It simplifies animation and enables rapid application of adjustments like expanding, rotating, narrowing, etc. Simply choose the beginning and ending keyframes, and Filmora will add all the intermediate frames automatically while preserving coherence. Keyframes may be altered by adjusting their position, transparency, size, etc.

##### Step5 Export the Animated Content

When you're through wanting to add the text animations to your projects, just click the Export button in the top-right portion of the screen as shown below to export them as a GIF.

In addition to the GIF export option in the export box, you may choose to share your creation with just one click on your official YouTube account.

## Part 3\. Related FAQs About Text Animations

### 1\. How do you make words move in After Effects?

In the Composition panel, choose the exact characters you wish to animate, or choose a text layer in the Timeline panel. Choose one of these: Select a property from the menu by selecting Animation > Animate Text. Use Animate. To animate a parameter, click the button to the right of the term "Animate." A Text Animator will be applied to the text after a parameter has been selected.

### 2\. How do you make 3D text in After Effects?

To begin, enter a word using the Type tool (T). To activate 3D on a layer, utilize the Switches/Modes toggle to examine the switches in the timeline and turn on the 3D Layer switch to the layer's right. When a layer is enabled for 3D, options to move it in 3D space and change the layer's appearance in the composition are made available.

### 3\. How to make logo animation in After Effects?

In After Effects, you may add your animation to the render queue as usual and choose "png sequence" from the output module options. Choose the 3D layer you wish to rotate. To find out if the Rotation tool affects Orientation or Rotation attributes, choose the Rotation tool and select Orientation or Rotation from the Set menu.

## The Bottom Line

Text animation may be obtained in a variety of methods. Text presets in After Effects are simple-to-use presets that may be applied to text layers, if you are not already acquainted with them. With the help of this manual, it is now incredibly simple to use and add animation flavor to the text and videos with little effort especially with the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) solution.

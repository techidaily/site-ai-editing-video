## How to Control the Speed of Video

Speed doesn't course at the same level for everyone. You can change momentum. You can slow it down and speed it up to convey a particular mood. In this article, you will learn how and when to control the speed of the video and its importance.

## Importance of Speeding up/Slowing Down Your video?

Speeding up or slowing it down, known as slow or fast motion, can make your video faster or slower than its actual speed, called speed ramping. Overall, adjusting the speed of video clips can enhance the video's visual effects, especially if you want to convey a particular mood to the audience. Speeding up your video may create a comical and dramatic impact, while slowing down your video can give viewers a time-lapse feel or an emotional mood.

This video speed controlling software can instantly speed up video up to 50x times. On the contrary, you can also slow down the video up to 0.1x, which means a one-minute video will run for 10 minutes.

How important is this Feature? The technique plays an essential role in adjusting the video's speed. You will appreciate this technique once you've started editing your video. At first, controlling the speed of your video without music will give you a plain or bare impression. Based on my experience, I cannot quickly identify which video part needs to control the speed. Still, once you've added music at the start, you can quickly determine when and where you should maintain the momentum based on the beat of the music.

## How to Speed up/Slow down a Video?

Nowadays, most video editing software offers an effortless way of giving special cinematic effects through speed ramping? Speed ramping is an approach to adjusting the clip's speed to send the message across and provide the audience with an element of confusion. Since speed ramp is a gradual increase in the acceleration or deceleration of a video clip, reasons to slow down or speed up video vary from merely decorative to practical, but whatever your reasons, speed effects can add some production value to your projects.

Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.

![adding paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png)

Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting **IN and OUT** points as we did before. Press the **I** key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the **O** key.

![selecting in and out points](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-015.png)

Step14 This time use the shortcut **Control + E** to open the export window. Again, let's name it **freeze frame 2** and then export it.

Step15 You can use the keyboard shortcut **Shift + X** to cancel the selected range. Then import **freeze frame 2** into the media folder and replace the freeze frame + paper photo. Adjust the length of this new clip to about 1 second.

![replaced the freeze frame and paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-016.png)

Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the **Transitions window** and find Evaporate 2.

![select the transition effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-017.png)

Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between **clip 1** and **freeze frame 1** and the cut between **clip 2** and **freeze frame 2**. You can also adjust the length of the transition.

![dropping the transition effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-018.png)

Step18 Then, find **Torned Paper Transition 4** in the **Transitions window**. Drag and drop it to the cut between **freeze frame 1** and **freeze frame 2**. Then choose **Prefix** mode in the transition setting video. Adjust the length if needed.

Finally, it's done. Let's play the video and see how the paper effect and transitions enhanced the video.

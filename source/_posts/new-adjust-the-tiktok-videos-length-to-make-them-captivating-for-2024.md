### Bonus Tip: Requirements and Specifications of TikTok Video

If you are confused about the details related to the TikTok video specifications, then look at the following specs table:

| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| **Aspect Ration** | 9:16 (Recommended)   |

## Part 3\. The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video

Hope the above part will prove helpful to you in terms of adjusting the TikTok video using Wondershare Filmora. Now, let's see what the common reasons which hinder users from adjusting the length of TikTok Videos are:

### 1\. The Video is Too Short

Most TikTok users worry about **why they can't adjust TikTok clip length.** The common reason behind this query is the short length of the video. If your video length is 3 seconds, then it would not be possible to shorten it further on TikTok. Thus, try to make a Video of at least 15 seconds to upload it on TikTok successfully.

### 2\. The Video is Too Long

If you have recorded a too-long video, it would not be possible to adjust its length on TikTok. Too long videos, especially more than 10 minutes, are less likely to be modified by TikTok. For that, you can take the help of Filmora to adjust its size. Filmora will trim the video to a suitable length within seconds.

### 3\. Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects

Sometimes people use those effects in videos that are difficult to edit. For example, using a green screen creates some technical issues in your video, which gets weirder when you try to adjust the length of such a video. Due to this, proper adjustments in such videos are difficult to do on TikTok.

### 4\. App Glitch

As many people are engaged in using TikTok, so sometimes the app slows down. It becomes pretty difficult to adjust the length of TikTok videos when the app shows glitches. However, on Filmora, the case is totally the opposite. You will never face any difficulty, no matter how many users are using it.

**Method 3\. Use Speed Ramping In Filmora for Better Video Results**

Speed ramping is evident as the action switches between slow, regular speed, and fast motion in innumerable action films and sports videos. When you progressively increase the pace of a video clip, this is called speed ramping. You have the option of changing pace swiftly or consistently in Filmora. It can vary the pace of the audio or video clips. Use the Speed Ramping feature in Filmora.

Double-click the media you want to speed up - choose **Speed > Speed Ramping**. Alternatively, right-click on the media and choose **Speed Ramping.** Another option is clicking the **Speed icon > Speed Ramping** in the toolbar.

The Speed Ramping tab will let you customize the speed line. Also, it provides you with 6 different templates you can use to enhance action footage. The templates are Bullet Time, Montage, Jumper, Hero Moment, Flash in, and Flash out. In case none of the templates appeal to you, you can create your own preset and save it.

The best thing about this feature is Filmora allows you to maintain the original audio pitch. Thus, it would not sound strange after speed-ramping the media.

For instance, the app may require up to 2 GB of storage space if your finished film is 1 GB.

If you're experiencing trouble downloading samples from the website, check that your Splice account is logged in on both the website and the desktop client. If you're not logged onto the same profile on both the website and the app, samples/packs you've purchased online won't appear.

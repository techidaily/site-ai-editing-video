## Part 1: Popular Visual Effects you can add to Zoom

You may apply one of four main graphic effects to your Zoom meetings. The visual effects that you may use in your next Zoom video chat are briefly summarized below.

### 1\. Visual Backgrounds

Virtual backdrops may transform any plain wall into an artistic setting. Zoom provides you the choice to add photographs to your backdrop in addition to offering you a few pre-made backdrops. Zoom lets you add a movie to your backdrop in addition to simply photographs. With the help of this imaginative feature, gather your pals and enjoy your favorite meme or video. A presentation's collection of photos, a video, or a single image may all serve as virtual backdrops. A green screen would often be used as your real backdrop and consistent lighting would be required.

To avoid having to reveal your real surroundings while in a conference, you may add any picture or video as a virtual backdrop in Zoom. You have the option of adding own photos and movies or selecting from the pre-existing backdrop films and images. The file type for video backgrounds should be MP4 or MOV, and the resolution should range from 360p to a maximum of 1080p. Ensure that the mirroring of your video is deselected in the Zoom's Video settings if your backdrop picture has text that may be read. By using virtual backdrops, you may alter the background of your video as it appears to the audience member with whom you are speaking. During the video conference you're in, the other participants will be able to view your face and body overlaid on the backdrop of your choice.

### 2\. Filters

With these filters, you can have fun in all of your Zoom meetings! Filters are a fun way to spend time with loved ones who are far away, particularly at a period when maintaining social distance is crucial. Filters are the modifications you make to yourself during Zoom meetings (such as a mustache, beard, etc.). They enliven the proceedings and contribute to the fun and memorability of your Zoom meetings.

Your films' colors may be changed, and video filters can also add new aspects. By selecting a filter appropriate for each event, like team meetings or game nights, you may create the right atmosphere. You may embellish your face in the video with flowers or animal traits by using Zoom's various filters. Alternately, you might just convert your video's color to black and white. The video filters from a different program, however, allow you to apply more vibrant filters and place a greater emphasis on special effects.

### 3\. Lighting and Touch-ups

The Lighting function enhances lighting effects and makes adjustments for low light situations to make you seem more professional during a Zoom conference. Similar to this, Touch-up enhances your facial characteristics by making your skin shine, erasing wrinkles, and giving your face a radiant appearance.

On your Zoom videos, changing your lighting and applying touch-ups may improve how you seem. By adjusting your lighting, you can make even dim illumination look bright. By doing touch-ups, you may get a smoother skin texture and get rid of any obvious imperfections.

### 4\. Studio Effects

Zoom has been developing on a new feature called Studio Effects that would give customers the option of using virtual cosmetics in their movies. They are still checking it out before formally releasing it since it is still in beta. However, it is still available to users under the Backgrounds & Filters area. You may adjust the opacity as you like. You have the option to choose a new color or one of the predefined colors. Additionally, you may decide to employ the face effects in all of your next meetings, albeit doing so might be problematic if you use Zoom for business. Don't worry if you're running late. Zoom can give your face a natural-looking cosmetic makeover in only one minute!

This function is intended for less formal settings, such as gatherings of friends or family. Anyone who wants to seem more professional during meetings has access to Studio Effects, which offers the choice of various eyebrow colors, beards, and lipsticks. These are a few recently added features. You may add mustaches, beards, and brows in a variety of designs, hues, and intensities. Additionally, you have the option of coloring your lips.

## Part 3\. Advanced Editing with Kdenlive

Now that we have discussed the basic editing Kdenlive tutorial, let us focus on a couple of useful advanced editing features of Kdenlive.

Use green screen effects:

You must have the video clip with green screen background on the timeline. Below the green screen clip should be the background image with which you want to replace the green screen background.

Step 1: Go to Effect> Alpha, Mask and Keying option.

Step 2: Drag and drop “Chroma Key : Advanced” on the video clip where there is a green screen.

Step 3: Click on video clip and adjust the parameters to soften the edges and make it as natural as possible.

****Add audio:**

Adding audio files and music files to the video is as easy as adding video clips. You should have your audio file ready on your hard drive.

Step 1: Go to Project menu option. Click on “Add Clip or Folder” option. Select the audio file or folder from your hard drive.

![kdenlive add clip or folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kdenlive-add-clip-or-folder.jpg)

Step 2: The imported audio files will have to be dragged and dropped on the timeline from Project Bin.

## Part 4\. Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos

Kdenlive has several drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the best video editor. Even though the features are sufficient for beginners, it is not suitable for professional editing. There is a lack of advanced options such as motion tracking or faster video production. Besides, the effects are very limited in number and so are the text and audio effects. That is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to Kdenlive Mac and Windows.

Filmora is a [premium video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with video capturing feature. You can record your screen and webcam video. There is no dearth of effects, filters, elements and royalty-free media files. The user interface is cleaner and hence, it is suitable for both beginners and professionals. Here are the key features of Filmora.

## How to Create Intro with Renderforest

When individuals hear about free online items, they frequently associate them with being of poor quality, ineffective, or unreliable. Renderforest, on the other hand, is an exception. This can be precisely what you need if you're seeking a cheap—or even free—high-quality online video editing platform. The service offers both freemium and premium solutions. The more expensive solutions provide the most flexibility.

## What is Renderforest?

A free online tool for making animated videos and slideshows is Renderforest. The web platform makes it simple, quick, and affordable for organizations and individuals to produce slideshows, explainer and promotional business movies, logo animations, and much more.

The online video creation platform Renderforest enables people and companies to produce "broadcast grade" videos for personal or professional usage. Anyone may register as a user in just a few easy steps, and using it is free.

Users can produce an infinite number of high-quality videos, export them, and then share them online or on social media.

The web platform already provides various tailor-made options for blog animations, wedding and photo slideshows, instructional films, and video invites for personal use.

Additionally, the platform offers simple-to-use alternatives for company presentations, invites to events, promotional films, kinetic typography, explainer videos, testimonials, and more.

**Renderforest's Primary Attributes include:**

* Videos of high quality
* A sizable collection of animation templates and storylines
* Access to more than 195,000 Royalty-free stock footage clips with an intuitive online movie editor
* One-click video publishing to YouTube channels or Facebook pages
* A music library with commercial licenses for use in making videos

**Added characteristics:**

* Create an infinite number of color schemes
* Countless font uploads

## How it Works

Choose a video template from their selection by browsing. Once you register, you can utilize any of the hundreds of editable templates that they have available.

You will be presented with various categories when you choose video templates, from promotional templates to logo animation templates to slide displays and everything in between.

You may freely post high-quality photographs, audio, and voice-over, an incredibly fantastic feature. The ability to share their tales in a way that customers can relate to is given to business owners by this.

After you've finished editing, the video must render for a while before it's prepared for publishing. Click the edit button if you want to make some changes to the video or are unsatisfied with it. The video can be edited as many times as you like.

Users can directly post their videos on social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and Instagram, through the website.

Renderforest maintains all your projects on your dashboard for as long as you use the service, so you don't have to fear that you'll lose your work..

## Pricing

Regarding costs, Renderforest provides four different kinds of subscription options. The Free, Amateur, Pro, and Business plans are among them. The Free program makes a fantastic study aid. It's possible to take your time with it, hone your talents, and upgrade to the paid plans after becoming familiar with the platform.

Regarding the free plan, you may watch and share your films on social media but not download them. You must utilize one of the paying subscriptions to download your videos. Choose the Business package if you don't want Renderforest's watermark to appear on your video. If you select monthly billing, it will cost you $149.99 per month or $49.99 per year.

If you want to take your company to the next level with distinctive videos, think about selecting one of the expertly produced video production packages. The starting package, which starts at $699, is the least priced.

## Tutorial on How to Create an Intro Using Renderforest

Professional video creators are likely aware that starting a video without a suitable introduction is equivalent to sneaking into someone's house without permission. A good intro is a doorbell to let people know you've arrived.

A strong introduction ensures that more people will view your film. Adults have an attention span of about 12 seconds, according to studies from 2000\. It is now only 8 seconds. You have 8 seconds to entice viewers to watch your video, so don't waste it. A captivating introduction will give your content a professional touch and pique your audience's interest. This task is worthwhile if you want to advertise your videos successfully.

These days, you don't necessarily need to hire a pro to make a film if you need one. The majority of the available tools are free. We'll demonstrate in this lesson how to use Renderforest to create a polished video intro. Our intro maker will let you start strong, whether for a fun birthday video or commercial use.

When you're prepared to begin producing your videos, go to Renderforest, register for an account, or sign in if you already have one.

Check out the vast selection of templates under "**Intros and logos**" in the "**Create Video**" section of the navigation menu. Here, you can select the intro you like most and begin altering it, or use our advanced search filters to locate the specific content you require.

![select intros and logos renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-intros-and-logos-renderforest.jpg)

We'll use the "**Swift Glitch Logo**" template for this tutorial, enabling you to present your logo with glitch effects. This template may produce intro and outro movies for presentations, your YouTube channel, lobby backgrounds, and other uses.

Select your preferred template and click the "**Create now**" button to start.

![swift glitch logo renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/swift-glitch-logo-renderforest.jpg)

Your logo should now be uploaded with a transparent background (PNG). You can upload it in one of three ways: using an image URL directly from your device or selecting an existing file from your "Media library." If you don't already have one, you may make one right away using our logo maker tool, which is also accessible in the editor.

![edit image for intro video renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-image-for-intro-video-renderforest.jpg)

Write your company's name, tagline, or other brief words in the text field once you've added your logo. To save the changes, don't forget to click "Save and close."

You can select the overall design of your logo and the preferred font style in the "Style" section.

## Competition to Renderforest

Animoto and PowToon are a couple of the site's main rivals. These are excellent online video editing tools, but Renderforest stands out because it is simple to use and enables even novice users to create, share quickly, and download "broadcast grade videos."

**Renderforest vs PowToon**

One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It's challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.

PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn't provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.

PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.

Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.

Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.

Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.

Fortunately, you don't have to believe us. You may experience all the main advantages of Renderforest yourself by giving it a try. Check out the pros and drawbacks list in our Renderforest review if you need more assistance.

##### Step5 Add a Fade effect

You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:

* Search the **Fade** option from the Transitions tab above the import window

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.

* Download the **Fade** transition and **drag** it between the Black screen and the first clip.

![adding a fade effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png)

Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!

##### Step6 Add The Music

You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:

* Click on the **Audio** icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.
* Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.
* Then add it to the timeline's audio track.

**Add Beat Detection**

To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:

* Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.
* You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.

* Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.

**Match The Video With The Audio Markers**

To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:

![matching the video with the audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png)

* Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.
* For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.

![synced video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png)

After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![unscaled photo in the main play window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png)

To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:

In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Effects** tab above the import window and search for **Blur**.
* Download the blur effect that suits you best and then **drag** the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.

You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.

* Head over to the Effects tab, where the **effects library** will open up

### 03Steps to create a graduation slideshow with music using Wondershare Filmora

Step 1\. Download, install and launch the Wondershare Filmora software on your system from the official software page. Tap on the New Project button to start creating a new slideshow.

Step 2\. Next, import and add all the images, music, and other media files to the Media Library of the software. These files can be then moved to the timeline. The order of the files can be changed as needed.

The editing features can be used to crop and customize the images and other media files as needed.

Step 3\. Now transitions can be added to the slideshow. The software has multiple options available like cross merge, sweep clockwise, and many more to choose from. The duration of the transitions can also be adjusted as needed.

Step 4\. Next comes the adding and editing of the background music. You can either add a song of your choice or can also use a music file from the built-in audio library. Voice-over recordings can also be added to give that extra personal touch. The audio files can also be edited using the supported features of the software.

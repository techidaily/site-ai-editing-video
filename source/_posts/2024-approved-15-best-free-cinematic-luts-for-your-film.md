For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file.

 First, upload the video to Kapwing's video merging tool. This free tool is available for iPhone, Android, PC, or tablet in Chrome or Safari browser. Click Upload to add the videos one at a time, or select multiple clips to import them all at once.

 Kapwing supports major video file types such as MP4, .FLV, .3PG. To embed a video from the web, just copy and paste the link. You can upload photos and GIFs and combine them with videos.

![combine-several-xvid-files-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-several-xvid-files-28.jpg)

Think of a video that looks great when spliced together into two consecutive videos. This can be a similar color palette, an event or travel video, or a video of the same person. When

videos are uploaded, the video preview shows how they look combined. Kapwing highlights each scene with a purple box during playback.

![combine-several-xvid-files-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-several-xvid-files-29.jpg)

**Step 2: Place the video /photo in the desired order.**

Think about which clips are next to each other and work best, and arrange them accordingly. You can drag clips to rearrange them and delete them when you no longer need them.

In the menu on the left, you can choose the format of the finished video (choose 1: 1 (square)), whether to crop the video (choose Fit to Border), and the length.

![combine-several-xvid-files-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-several-xvid-files-30.jpg)

The video should be a montage photo Kapwing also has the option to crop the video clip to shorten the required section.

Creators can crop videos and remove sections from the center. To crop a clip, first select it and click Edit to open Kapwing Studio.

![combine-several-xvid-files-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-several-xvid-files-31.jpg)

Drag both ends of the layer to change the timing of the start and end of the clip, or click the timing and use the arrow keys to make fine adjustments.

Besides trimming, you can look at other edits. To remove a section or add a clip in the center, use the split tool above the timeline or type "s" on your keyboard and use the shortcut.

Next, delete the layers you no longer need, drag the clips to combine them, and display them side by side on the timeline.

 creators have more control over the montage by editing the scene in Studio. In Studio, you can add music to your montage,

 insert title slides, attach endings, watermark corners, and animate.

![combine-several-xvid-files-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-several-xvid-files-32.jpg)

**Step 3: Save the merged video**

When you have finished merging the video into the merged video, click Export Video in the upper right corner. Once the video is processed, you will be taken to the download page.

From here, you can save the video to your device or create a free account with your Google or Facebook login credentials to remove the watermark first.

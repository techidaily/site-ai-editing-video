03 [How to Create After Effects Gifs](#Part 3)

## Part 1 General Knowledge on GIF Animation

### 01What is a GIF?

The acronym GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and the file is created in bitmap image format. This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.

This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.

However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.

Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.

You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.

### 02Why create a GIF?

Here are a handful of things you can keep your eye on if you are just starting on making GIFs;

**●** Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.

**●** You can provide instructions in a short span of time.

**●** UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.

**●** You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.

**●** You can display some amazing things on your website.

## Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop

Creating GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop are both one in the same thing but the results may vary depending on which choice of tools and features suits you better.

Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.

### 01What’s Similar?

Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.

### 02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition

In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.

Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.

Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.

### 03Vector and Shapes

You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.

### 04Destructive Effects

After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.

You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.

## Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs

After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.

Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.

### 01Animating in After Effects

**Step 1:** Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.

![new composition after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.

![project panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.

![timeline panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg)

Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.

![set scale after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg)

You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.

![set scale after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-5.jpg)

Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.

![repeat process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-6.jpg)

Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.

![set position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-7.jpg)

Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.

**Step 4:** Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.

![render after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-8.jpg)

If you find **exporting gifs from After Effects** too complicated, you can also upload and loop videos using **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** which has plenty of other amazing video editing features you can drag and drop to create.

### 02Converting Animation to GIF in Photoshop

**Step 1:** Create a new file in Photoshop with the same specs as you did in After Effects. Now go to ‘File’ > ‘Import’ > ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.

![import file photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-9.jpg)

**Step 2:** If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows > Timeline.

![timeline photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ > Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.

![export and save as gif photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-11.jpg)

**Step 4:** In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.

## Part 1 Ending Thoughts

**●** GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe **after effects gifs** or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.

**●** You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.

![import file photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-9.jpg)

**Step 2:** If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows > Timeline.

![timeline photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ > Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.

![export and save as gif photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-11.jpg)

**Step 4:** In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.

## Part 1 Ending Thoughts

**●** GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe **after effects gifs** or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.

**●** You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.

**●** After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after **exporting after effects to gif**. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.

GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.

Unfortunately, you won’t be able to **make a gif in after effects** directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.

Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.

In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create **after effects GIFs** within a matter of minutes.

02 [What Is the Difference Between After Effects Gifs’ Making and Photoshop Gifs’ Making?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create After Effects Gifs](#Part 3)

## Part 1 General Knowledge on GIF Animation

### 01What is a GIF?

The acronym GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and the file is created in bitmap image format. This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.

This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.

However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.

Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.

You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.

### 02Why create a GIF?

Here are a handful of things you can keep your eye on if you are just starting on making GIFs;

**●** Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.

**●** You can provide instructions in a short span of time.

**●** UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.

**●** You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.

**●** You can display some amazing things on your website.

## Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop

Creating GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop are both one in the same thing but the results may vary depending on which choice of tools and features suits you better.

Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.

### 01What’s Similar?

Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.

### 02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition

In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.

Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.

Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.

### 03Vector and Shapes

You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.

### 04Destructive Effects

After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.

You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.

## Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs

After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.

Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.

### 01Animating in After Effects

**Step 1:** Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.

![new composition after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.

![project panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.

![timeline panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg)

Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.

![set scale after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg)

You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.

![set scale after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-5.jpg)

Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.

![repeat process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-6.jpg)

Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.

![set position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-7.jpg)

**Step 4:** Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.

![adding a fade effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png)

Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!

##### Step6 Add The Music

You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:

* Click on the **Audio** icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.
* Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.
* Then add it to the timeline's audio track.

**Add Beat Detection**

To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:

* Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.
* You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.
* Click on **Beat detection**.

![adding beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png)

* Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.

**Match The Video With The Audio Markers**

To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:

![matching the video with the audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png)

* Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.
* For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.
* Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.

![synced video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png)

After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![unscaled photo in the main play window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png)

To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:

* **Double-click** on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.
* Go into the **Transform** Here you can see multiple settings.
* Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.

![scaling of the photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png)

**Add a Background Blur Effect**

In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Effects** tab above the import window and search for **Blur**.
* Download the blur effect that suits you best and then **drag** the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.

You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.

![photo with blurred background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png)

##### Step8 Add a Transition

You can also add a transition effect to spice up things. It can get bland when your video or photo changes from one to another. To create a good slideshow video, you can add a transition effect by following the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Transition** icon above the import window.
* **Browse** the library until you find a transition you like, then download one.
* Click on the transition and drag it between the clips.

![transition effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-15.gif)

**Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition**

Now it's time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:

* **Double-click** on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.
* You can adjust the duration by setting the timer as per your requirement.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.

![adjusting the duration of the transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-16.png)

When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.

##### Step9 Add the Effects and Filters

If you create a slideshow video of your trip to a historical place. You can add a Vintage filter to your video to give it that vintage tint. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Head over to the Effects tab, where the **effects library** will open up
* Select any effect and **download**
* Click on the effect and **drag** it to **drop** in the timeline.

![adding the vintage effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-17.png)

* Click on the **effects** and search for **Glow** in the search bar.
* Click and drag the glow effect above the timeline and ensure the effect is in the separate video timeline.

![adding the glow effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-18.png)

We are almost done. Let us now move toward our outro!

##### Step10 Create an Outro

The steps we will do will be similar to the ones we did initially. As we are creating, we will again need a canvas. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Head to the **media** icon on the bar and scroll until you see the sample **media tab**.
* In the sample color option, **drag** and **drop** the black color at the end of your video.

**Add an Outro Transition**

To finalize things, add a transition effect at the end of the clip by these steps:

* In the **Transition** tab, search for the Fade effect.
* Drag and drop the **Fade** effect between your last video clip and the Black screen.

![adding a black screen at the end](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-19.png)

**Fade out The Audio**

If the audio suddenly ends at the end of your slideshow, it will create a bitter effect. Therefore, you should always fade out audio at the end of the video. To do this, follow the steps mentioned:

* **Double-click** on the audio in the timeline, and the settings list will pop up.

Let's start with the step-by-step instructions for making a slideshow video now that you know the requirements for generating a slideshow.

## Part 5\. Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Slideshow Video

Utilizing filmora will reduce your workload while producing quality work. Follow the below step-by-step guide to make your slideshow video instantly!

##### Step1 Download Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare Filmora will provide the working platform. Follow the below steps to download it:

* First, install the Wondershare Filmora.
* Then, launch this application on your PC or Mac

Let's proceed to edit our video after downloading the Wondershare Filmora software. Continue reading to find out how to begin the editing process.

##### Step2 Import your Photos and Videos

Importing your videos and pictures to Filmora's media panel is best to have them all in one folder. Therefore, when you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.

* Click in the center of the **import** window upon the import icon.
* **Browse** from the PC library to where your target Videos and Photos are stored.
* Please select the required videos and photos and **Open**

![import your videos and photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-2.png)

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.

##### Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline

When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want.
* Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![add your photos and videos to your timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-3.png)

Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.

##### Step4 Add the Title

To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.

**Add a Black Screen**

The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:

* Click on the **media** icon from the bar above the import window.
* You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.
* Scroll below to find the **sample media**
* Download the black color if it is not downloaded already.
* Click and drag it down below to the start of your video.

![adding a black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-4.png)

**Add a Title Tile**

Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a **Title** icon.

* Click on the **title** icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.
* For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called "**Title 29**."

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.

* Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.
* **Double-click** the title to open its settings.
* Here you can type in the text that you want.

![add a title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-5.png)

You can also change its font. When you click on the font bar, a drop-down option will pop up, and you choose whichever you like.

* Change the **animation** of the text title from the top left corner **animation**

**Change The Timing of The Title**

You can also adjust the timing of the title by below steps:

* Click on the **advanced option** in the bottom right corner, and settings will pop up.
* Find the title bar and drag it to the right side to increase the timing of the title.

![change the timing of the title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-6.png)

After adding the title, it's time to go with fading effect as shown below!

##### Step5 Add a Fade effect

You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:

* Search the **Fade** option from the Transitions tab above the import window

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.

* Download the **Fade** transition and **drag** it between the Black screen and the first clip.

![adding a fade effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png)

Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!

##### Step6 Add The Music

You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:

* Click on the **Audio** icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.
* Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.
* Then add it to the timeline's audio track.

**Add Beat Detection**

To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:

* Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.
* You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.
* Click on **Beat detection**.

![adding beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png)

* Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.

**Match The Video With The Audio Markers**

To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:

![matching the video with the audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png)

* Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.
* For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.
* Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.

![synced video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png)

After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![unscaled photo in the main play window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png)

To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:

* **Double-click** on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.
* Go into the **Transform** Here you can see multiple settings.
* Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.

![scaling of the photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png)

**Add a Background Blur Effect**

In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Effects** tab above the import window and search for **Blur**.
* Download the blur effect that suits you best and then **drag** the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.

You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.

![photo with blurred background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png)

##### Step8 Add a Transition

You can also add a transition effect to spice up things. It can get bland when your video or photo changes from one to another. To create a good slideshow video, you can add a transition effect by following the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Transition** icon above the import window.
* **Browse** the library until you find a transition you like, then download one.
* Click on the transition and drag it between the clips.

![transition effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-15.gif)

**Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition**

Now it's time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:

* **Double-click** on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.
* You can adjust the duration by setting the timer as per your requirement.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.

![adjusting the duration of the transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-16.png)

When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.

##### Step9 Add the Effects and Filters

If you create a slideshow video of your trip to a historical place. You can add a Vintage filter to your video to give it that vintage tint. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Head over to the Effects tab, where the **effects library** will open up
* Select any effect and **download**
* Click on the effect and **drag** it to **drop** in the timeline.

![adding the vintage effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-17.png)

Combining a vintage effect with a dreamy glow will make your video pop up even more. To add a nostalgic glow to your video, follow the steps:

* Click on the **effects** and search for **Glow** in the search bar.
* Click and drag the glow effect above the timeline and ensure the effect is in the separate video timeline.
* Ensure the effect is applied to every photo and video.
* **Double-click** on the effect, and settings will open in the import window.
* Then, you can adjust the radius and opacity of the video. Adjust as you desire.

![adding the glow effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-18.png)

We are almost done. Let us now move toward our outro!

##### Step10 Create an Outro

The steps we will do will be similar to the ones we did initially. As we are creating, we will again need a canvas. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Head to the **media** icon on the bar and scroll until you see the sample **media tab**.
* In the sample color option, **drag** and **drop** the black color at the end of your video.

**Add an Outro Transition**

To finalize things, add a transition effect at the end of the clip by these steps:

* In the **Transition** tab, search for the Fade effect.
* Drag and drop the **Fade** effect between your last video clip and the Black screen.

![adding a black screen at the end](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-19.png)

**Fade out The Audio**

If the audio suddenly ends at the end of your slideshow, it will create a bitter effect. Therefore, you should always fade out audio at the end of the video. To do this, follow the steps mentioned:

* **Double-click** on the audio in the timeline, and the settings list will pop up.
* On the top section of the import window, you will notice fade options.
* In the fade-out bar, drag it to the side to set your fade-out timer.

You can show your friends and family the slideshow or upload it to Youtube. Play the Slideshow Video from the beginning to see the changes.

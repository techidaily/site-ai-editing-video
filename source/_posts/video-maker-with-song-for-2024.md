## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

![how to freeze-frame in After Effect 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tips-to%20freeze-frame-in%20after-effect-2.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

02 [FAQs on Freeze Effect on After Effects](#Part 2)

03 [Compared with Filmora, What Are the Advantages of Freeze-frame After Effects?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

Thus, you successfully used the **After Effects Freeze Frame** to bring cinematic effects to your video.

## Part 2 **FAQs on Freeze Effect on After Effects**

Now, let us view some common FAQs that may come across while using **After Effects frame hold.**

**●** **What does freeze do in After Effects?**

With After Effects holding the last frame (freeze-frame), you can instantly add multiple layers, effects, transitions, audio, and other media. In addition, the **freeze-frame in After Effect** pauses or stops the specific frame that you want to feature or focus.

**●** **Why can't I freeze-frame in After Effects?**

The reason you cannot **freeze-frame in After Effect** could be a result of the greyed-out features. With this grey-out feature, a freeze-frame cannot be created or added from a sequence, as you will be required to go back to the original clip to create a freeze-frame or any other type of Effect.

**●** **How do you Freeze the current frame for the duration of the layer in After Effects 2020?**

**●** First, in the Composition or the Timeline panel, pick the layer.

**●** Place the current-time indicator on the frame that you want to freeze.

**●** Choose Layer > Time > Freeze-frame.

Other Advantages of Freeze-frame in Adobe After Effect is that:

**●** The images can be worked upon quickly without discussion or rehearsed and planned.

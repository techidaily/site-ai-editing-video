Telegram's security function allows you to hide your profile picture so that only people who you approve can see it, which is a great way to keep your privacy and avoid unwanted attention.

Follow the instructions below step-by-step to hide your **Telegram profile picture** on iPhone and Android.

##### iPhone

Step1 On your iPhone, launch the **Telegram app** and go to the **"Settings"** tab at the bottom right of the screen.

Step2 Select **"Privacy and Security"** and tap the **"Profile Photo"** option.

Step3 If you want to keep your profile picture private, choose the **"My Contacts"** option. This way, only people in your contact book will be able to see it.

Step4 You can add exceptions to your privacy settings from the **"Exceptions"** section. To hide your Telegram profile picture from certain users/contacts or groups, tap the **"Never Share With"** button. This will help prevent someone who is harassing you from seeing your profile picture.

Now, choose **"Add Users or Groups,"** search for and select their name from your list of contacts. Finally, tap **"Done"** to apply your changes.

![setting profile picture to never share with certain people](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/setting-profile-picture-to-never-share-with-certain-people.jpg)

## Have the Desire to Create a Stylish Glitch Effect to a Text on Your Video? Use Filmora for the Editing, Following the Given Steps Explained in Detail

Have you noticed the glitching effect that appears when you play a video or in games, creating a sporadic shaky effect on video edges? While this usually signifies a systematic software issue in these cases, the effect itself can work to create a dynamic visual style for different objects when done intentionally.

In fact, many video editors today use the glitch effect on elements in their videos, like the introductory title in movies or trailers. It creates a futuristic look to the text, which highly appeals to viewers who engage more in the video itself.

Suppose you are looking to add a similar effect to the title of your video project or other text-based content that you will add to your video, use a good tool for that. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), in particular, makes adding this effect very simple. Let's learn how.

## 1\. Launch the Filmora software

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The first step in preparing a customized glitch text effect is getting your software ready.

Visit the official website of Wondershare Filmora and tap on the Download button at the top to get the free software. The features necessary to create this effect are available under the free version, so you can avoid the plan upgradation process at this point.

After clicking the free download icon, the software's installer version will save into your device automatically. Double-click on and agree with the related Terms and Conditions prompt. Then, tap on the Install button, and the software will take a few seconds to complete the installation process fully.

After that, click on the Start Now button to launch the software on your Mac or Windows computer that you are using. Filmora will open on its homepage.

## 2\. Add the default title to timeline

Next, click the Create New Project button on the main page to access the editor section. Then, you have to click on the Titles tab and choose the Default Title option from the menu.

Drag it down from the media library section to the timeline and drop it in the Track 2 row. After that, move the play head with your cursor to the 1-second and the 10th frame on the timeline. Then, hold and move this clip until the end part of the clip is at this mark.

![move to playhead](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-2.jpg)

## 3\. Adjust the font of the title

Next, double-click on this clip on the editor timeline to open the text editing window. Here, under the Preset section, change the title font to what to want to first word of your title to be.

Change the font style to a bigger bold option like Impact and increase the font size to 100\. Then, scroll a little downward and tap on the Text Spacing option. Increase this value by 5 and press the OK button when you are done.

![tap on the text spacing button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-3.jpg)

## 4\. Add and copy all of the word clips

After adjusting the text font, tap on this clip on the timeline and copy it. Then, paste it just after the first clip ends, reducing its duration to around 1 second.

Then, double-click on the copied clip to open the text editing window. Click on the section where you can add the text and change it to the second word of your title. Again, copy this clip and paste it next to it, adjust it to be one second long, double-click on it to adjust the text to read the third word, and so on.

![change text to second word](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-4.jpg)

Continue until all of your intro's words are added in these clip forms.

## 5\. Create and add the snapshots

Following the previous step, click on the My Media section. Then, tap on the first clip in the collection and tap on the Snapshot icon at the end of the editing toolbar right above the timeline. Repeat this step for all the clips you have added until a snapshot of each of the words is stored in the media library.

Next, you have to grab hold of the first snapshot that you click and move it to the Track 1 of the timeline. Use the cursor to hold it and reduce the size of the clip to the same amount as the first clip on Track 1\. To be sure, you can place the playhead at this point to see that the ending time for both clips is aligned.

![reduce snapshot clip size same as track 1 clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-5.jpg)

## 6\. Adjust the text effect for the first word

You have to click on the first-word snapshot in Track 1 of the Filmora editing timeline and double-click on it. Next, when the text editing window opens, you must change the Scale section to display the value of 290%. Following that, click on the slider in the Opacity parameter and decrease it to the 7% mark. Then, press the OK button.

On the timeline, right-click on this edited clip and choose the "Copy Effects" option from the drop-down menu.

![press the ok button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-6.jpg)

## 7\. Edit the snapshots for all words

After making changes to the first word, you must take hold of the second word's snapshot from the media library. Drag and then drop it onto Track 1 of the editing timeline right next to the first clip. Then, hold the edge of this clip and reduce its size to fit the same duration as the second clip adjacent to it on Track 2.

Following that, you must choose this clip on Track 1 and right-click on top of it. Click on the "Paste Effects" option from the next drop-down menu, and the same adjustments will apply to this clip.

![click on the paste effects option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-7.jpg)

Repeat this step with all of the next snapshots of the following words.

## 8\. Add the first effect layer

Next, you have to add stylish effects to your text. For that, you must tap on the Effects tab from the top toolbar of Filmora- a list of many effects collections will appear on the left panel.

Scroll down until you reach the Filmstock option. You must click on it and find the Flicker option from the list. Under this collection, there are many options available. You must choose the Video\_seg effect and drag it to the editing timeline above Track 2.

![drag it down to the editing timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-8.jpg)

At this point, ensure the effect falls right above the first and second clip parts in the track below. Tap on the edges of this clip to reduce the size of the video effect, taking careful note to keep the clip 8 frames long overall.

Then, copy the cut-down effect from Track 3 and paste it at every intersectional point between the separated word-based clips in Track 2.

![paste it at every intersectional point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-9.jpg)

## 9\. Zoom in to edit the first effect layer

Following this, you must zoom into the timeline for a better view and editing control for the next part.

Go to the Effects tab at the top and choose the Filters collection next. Under it, choose the Chaos 1 effect option, drag it down to the timeline, and place it above the previous clip on Track 4\. Adjust the starting edge of this clip to have the same starting point as the Video\_seg effect on Track 3 with an overall 8-frame duration.

![adjust the edges of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-10.jpg)

## 10\. Edit the Effect

Next, you have to double-click on this clip to open the editing window for this effect. In this section, go to the Frequency parameter and increase the slider to 400\. Following that, click on the Position X parameter and move the slider to the 0.20 point. Next, do the same for the Position Y parameter, but to the 0.70 point.

Change the Position Z parameter by typing the value 40 and disable the RGB Separate setting. Then, press the OK button and go to the timeline again.

![disable the rgb separate setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-11.jpg)

## 11\. Adjust the Glitch effects

Click on the effect clip on Track 4 and copy it. Please do the same as you did for the effect in Track 3 and paste it at the same locations between the clips in this track.

Afterward, go to the Effects tab again and choose the Filmstock tab. Among the collections here, you have to choose the Glitch option and select Glitch Stripe 1 from the collection. For an easier searching experience, you can directly type the effect in the search bar under the Effects tab.

![select glitch stripe 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-12.jpg)

Then, drag and drop it on Track 5 of the timeline right above the previous effect and reduce its duration to the same level as the first two effects. Copy it and then paste the clip again for each clip-to-clip intersection.

After this part, drag the Glitch Dispersion effect down to the timeline. Place it above the previous effect and adjust the clip's size to the same length. Again, copy the effect and repeat the steps again. Next, repeat the same whole process with the Negative Flicker effect from the Flicker collection on Track 7.

![add negative flicker effect and adjust it](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-13.jpg)

![Wondershare Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png)

## Part 1: Finding the Best Resolution for DaVinci Resolve Slow Playback Issue

As Highlighted, DaVinci Resolve is a good video editor for all kinds of use cases. Although it's a powerful tool, it still shows some errors like choppy and slow playback. Modern problems require modern solutions. Thus, read the given fixes to make **DaVinci Resolve faster playback.** All the methods are easy and helpful for a smooth playback experience on Windows and macOS.

* [Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution](#davinci1)
* [Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution](#davinci2)
* [Solution 3: Enable Render Cache](#davinci3)
* [Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature](#davinci4)
* [Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files](#davinci5)
* [Solution 6: Disable Color Grades](#davinci6)

### Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution

In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the "Playback" menu from the top. Then, select "Timeline Proxy Resolution" and pick one either "Half" or "Quarter" options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.

![lower playback resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

### Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on "OK."

![change timeline resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-2.jpg)

### Solution 3: Enable Render Cache

It’s another solution to fix the **DaVinci resolve slow playback**. Render cache is a file that stores the rendered frames and makes the rendering faster. Start by hitting the “Playback” option and choose “Render Cache.” Then, you’ll see 3 options: None, Smart, and User. You should select "Smart" and let DaVinci Resolve pick one clip to be cached.

![enable render cache slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

### Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature

Every change you make gets saved with the Live Save option in DaVinci Resolve. If your remote drive is linked, this feature can drag the playback speed down. You can disable it for a **DaVinci resolve faster playback**.

Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.

![disable live save feature slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

### Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files

Another solution is to use proxy media during the project editing. Proxy files are small copy files transcoded from a larger, original video file. Get the proxy file to increase the playback and go to your "Media Pool" in DaVinci Resolve. Right-click on the intended file and choose "Generate Proxy Media" from the list.

![use proxy files slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-5.jpg)

### Solution 6: Disable Color Grades

If you are still failing to resolve the slow playback issue on Davinci Resolve, try this fix. Disable color grades and other effects in the first place. To do so, head to the DaVinci Resolve Edit Page. After getting there, press the "Bypass Color Grades and Fusion Effects” button from the top right side. This way, you can surely solve the **DaVinci Resolve slow-down playback** error.

## Part 2: What Makes a Slow-Motion Video Good?

After resolving the **DaVinci Resolve slow playback**, let's continue further editing. Create a slow-motion video to emphasize certain information in the video. It involves technical and creative elements for a good-quality video. You can read this section to understand the points that contribute to a good Slow-motion video.

* **Frame Rate:** Keep the frame rate higher for a good slow-motion video. In this regard, you can use common frame rates such as 60fps, 120fps, and 140fps. Moreover, you should pick video clips that are originally captured in a high frame rate.
* **Shutter Speed:** Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.
* **Resolution:** A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.
* **Editing and Timing:** Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.

## Part 1: Finding the Best Resolution for DaVinci Resolve Slow Playback Issue

As Highlighted, DaVinci Resolve is a good video editor for all kinds of use cases. Although it's a powerful tool, it still shows some errors like choppy and slow playback. Modern problems require modern solutions. Thus, read the given fixes to make **DaVinci Resolve faster playback.** All the methods are easy and helpful for a smooth playback experience on Windows and macOS.

* [Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution](#davinci1)
* [Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution](#davinci2)

* [Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature](#davinci4)
* [Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files](#davinci5)
* [Solution 6: Disable Color Grades](#davinci6)

### Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution

In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the "Playback" menu from the top. Then, select "Timeline Proxy Resolution" and pick one either "Half" or "Quarter" options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.

![lower playback resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

### Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on "OK."

### Solution 3: Enable Render Cache

It’s another solution to fix the **DaVinci resolve slow playback**. Render cache is a file that stores the rendered frames and makes the rendering faster. Start by hitting the “Playback” option and choose “Render Cache.” Then, you’ll see 3 options: None, Smart, and User. You should select "Smart" and let DaVinci Resolve pick one clip to be cached.

![enable render cache slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.

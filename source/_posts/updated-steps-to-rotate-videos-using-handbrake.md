## Steps to Rotate Videos Using Handbrake

Handbrake is a video editing tool that allows you to rotate videos. It is a free and open source software that is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is used to convert video files from one format to another. You can use it to compress videos, add subtitles, or create chapters. It also allows you to rotate videos in different directions. You can use it to fix videos that are not aligned properly or that have been filmed upside down. A handbrake is a popular tool because it is easy to use and it has a variety of features.

## Step-by-step on how to rotate videos using Handbrake

When you import a video into the Handbrake software, it will by default be in a "landscape" orientation, with the long edge of the video oriented horizontally. If you want to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise so that it appears "vertical," or if you want to rotate it 180 degrees so that it is upside down, you can do so by following these two steps:

Step 1: Open the Handbrake software and import your video.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-1.png)

Step 2: Click on the "Dimensions" tab at the top of the Handbrake window.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-2.png)

Step 3: Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, click on one of the options in the "Rotate" menu.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-3.png)

Step 4: If you want to rotate a video 90 degrees counterclockwise, select "90 Degrees CW (Counter-Clockwise)." If you want to rotate the video 180 degrees so that it is upside down, select "180 Degrees."

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-4.png)

Step 5: Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-5.png)

The Handbrake software also offers a "Flip" option which you can do after rotating it, which allows you to slip the video after rotating it. To use this option, follow these steps:

Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, Go to Rotation and choose the degrees that best is best for your rotation requirements.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-6.png)

Click on "Flip" to flip your video horizontally.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-7.png)

## 4 Methods to Crop a Video on Android Easily

Nowadays, we can use our mobile phones to create almost anything – they have become an indivisible part of our lives. Most of the people check their mobile phones every 2 minutes – did they receive a new message?

What about different kinds of notifications – reactions on social network, or the ones which inform us about breaking news, or, to-do lists? People are well-connected to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and sometimes, we just want to update our accounts with just photos or new videos we took on the go. Sometimes, we have a perfect footage we took with our Android, but we have no idea, or just no time to edit our stunning video clips on the computer.

Yes, changing or adjusting a video shouldn’t be that hard – you shouldn’t be obligated to turn to Adobe Premiere Pro or other “heavy” software in order to have a video to your whole liking. Therefore, we have mobile applications just for editing our videos, in a simple, and fast way (thank you, mobile developers!).

In this article, we will be discussing how to crop a video on Android, but since most android devices don’t have this option, you will need to do it externally, by downloading and using different apps. So, more concretely, we will touch upon how to crop our video clips using following apps: Google Photos, Clideo, and Filmora.

## Using Google Photos

In case you have Android, the Google Photos app will be there – it’s free and in most cases, already installed and ready to serve you. If you can’t find Google Photos, just find it and download it from the Google Play Store.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-1.jpeg)

First off, you just open the application and allow it to access photos and media on your device. Tap the video you would like to crop. Then, click on Edit: it will launch the in-app video editor.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-2.jpeg)

At the bottom, you will see the Crop option and hit on it, which will result in appearing a cropping box around your video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-3.jpeg)

Once you see little icons at the bottom, you need to choose the first one – it’s the Ratio button, through which you can choose the aspect you would like to apply. Your choice is between these several aspect ratios: Free, Original, Square, 5:4, 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-4.jpeg)

Choosing Free ratio option gives you the freedom to adjust the cropping sliders manually, in order to resize the video to any aspect ratio; it is even possible to rotate the clip, pinch, and zoom in/out.

After you are done with adjusting your video, you need to click on the Save Copy button, which will save a new edited version of your footage. And, meanwhile, don’t worry! – this will not be overwritten on the original one, which will still stand intact.

## Using Clideo

Clideo is an interesting one… it doesn’t require you to download anything, because there is a way to crop your video online, through the web browser on Android.

First off, you need to click on [Clideo’s Android crop video tool](https://clideo.com/crop-video) from the browser on the smartphone. You will see a Choose File button and hit on it – this will take you to your gallery and let you find the clip you are about to crop.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-5.jpeg)

You can also upload your file from Cloud Storage. You need to click on the down-arrow on the right-hand side of the button and you’ll find the option to add a clip from your Dropbox or Google Drive account.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-6.jpeg)

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-7.jpeg)

After your file is uploaded, Clideo will take you to the editing page, where you can select the area you would like to be in the edited version, and crop the video. Here, you will be able to choose the aspect ratio, exact size of the video and the format.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-8.jpeg)

Once you have finished with the cropping and settings, you need to click on Export which will process your edited video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-9.jpeg)

Once it is done, you proceed on the page which lets you do 3 things: Remove watermark (for it, though, you will have to sign in), Edit again, or/and Download!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-10.jpeg)

## Using Filmora

Once you have chosen your file, you click on Next button and you proceed to the editor itself.

There, you will see different options at the bottom of your phone, such as Trim, Music, Text, Sticker, Effect, etc.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-13.jpeg)

 It doesn’t show you the option Crop right away, but Crop is “hidden” behind the Trim button!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-14.jpeg)

So, you choose Trim, then find Crop and hit that, and then you are free to choose any aspect ratio: 1:1; 4:5; 16:9; 9:16; and 5:4\. You can crop the video manually, too, and you are able to adjust where your new “screen” might be wanted most.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-15.jpeg)

After you have finished with cropping and are satisfied, you can click on Export, which will take a few seconds.

So, you choose Trim, then find Crop and hit that, and then you are free to choose any aspect ratio: 1:1; 4:5; 16:9; 9:16; and 5:4\. You can crop the video manually, too, and you are able to adjust where your new “screen” might be wanted most.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-15.jpeg)

After you have finished with cropping and are satisfied, you can click on Export, which will take a few seconds.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-16.jpeg)

After it is done, you can find your newly-cropped video in your Camera Roll.

You will choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-19.jpeg)

Above your video in the sequence you will see little icons and find a Crop one.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-20.jpeg)

After clicking on it, a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-21.jpeg)

After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video at last.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-22.jpeg)

So, that’s all for this article – you have learned how to crop a video on Android, using Google Photos, Clideo, Filmora; lastly, you have learned about how to crop a video using a desktop version of Filmora, namely, Wondershare Filmora. Hopefully, this is the information which will help you make your videos more “on spot” and be satisfied with the results, as well as satisfy your viewers!

First off, you just open the application and allow it to access photos and media on your device. Tap the video you would like to crop. Then, click on Edit: it will launch the in-app video editor.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-2.jpeg)

At the bottom, you will see the Crop option and hit on it, which will result in appearing a cropping box around your video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-3.jpeg)

Once you see little icons at the bottom, you need to choose the first one – it’s the Ratio button, through which you can choose the aspect you would like to apply. Your choice is between these several aspect ratios: Free, Original, Square, 5:4, 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-4.jpeg)

Choosing Free ratio option gives you the freedom to adjust the cropping sliders manually, in order to resize the video to any aspect ratio; it is even possible to rotate the clip, pinch, and zoom in/out.

After you are done with adjusting your video, you need to click on the Save Copy button, which will save a new edited version of your footage. And, meanwhile, don’t worry! – this will not be overwritten on the original one, which will still stand intact.

## Using Clideo

Clideo is an interesting one… it doesn’t require you to download anything, because there is a way to crop your video online, through the web browser on Android.

First off, you need to click on [Clideo’s Android crop video tool](https://clideo.com/crop-video) from the browser on the smartphone. You will see a Choose File button and hit on it – this will take you to your gallery and let you find the clip you are about to crop.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-5.jpeg)

You can also upload your file from Cloud Storage. You need to click on the down-arrow on the right-hand side of the button and you’ll find the option to add a clip from your Dropbox or Google Drive account.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-6.jpeg)

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-7.jpeg)

After your file is uploaded, Clideo will take you to the editing page, where you can select the area you would like to be in the edited version, and crop the video. Here, you will be able to choose the aspect ratio, exact size of the video and the format.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-8.jpeg)

Once you have finished with the cropping and settings, you need to click on Export which will process your edited video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-9.jpeg)

Once it is done, you proceed on the page which lets you do 3 things: Remove watermark (for it, though, you will have to sign in), Edit again, or/and Download!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-10.jpeg)

## Using Filmora

Filmora is an android version of software Filmora and it also gives you the opportunity to crop videos and photos with no problem. First, of course, you have to download the application from Google Play Store, and open it;

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-11.jpeg)

then, after opening it, you’ll click on New Project. You can choose any photo/video from your albums or stock, you might even select multiple clips.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-12.jpeg)

Once you have chosen your file, you click on Next button and you proceed to the editor itself.

There, you will see different options at the bottom of your phone, such as Trim, Music, Text, Sticker, Effect, etc.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-13.jpeg)

 It doesn’t show you the option Crop right away, but Crop is “hidden” behind the Trim button!

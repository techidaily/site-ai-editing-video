* **Learning curve**: You need to compare the editing software options that you have to determine which one is complex to learn and which one is easy. This will save you the time and effort you would have spent downloading multiple products to test.
* **Quality**: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, and you need to choose the one that supports your video format.
* **Resources**: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor with all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.
* **Compatability**: Check whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you want to use. Consult the internet for compatibility by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.

* **Quality**: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, and you need to choose the one that supports your video format.
* **Resources**: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor with all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.

## Don't Make These Mistakes

Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.

Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires "persons with a thick skin."

Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:

#### 1\. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor

Almost every videographer and colorist's goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.

Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.

Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.

#### 2\. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage

One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.

Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.

The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.

#### 3\. Imbalancing the Shadow

Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.

This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.

#### 4\. Overusing LUTs

A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.

When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.

#### 5\. Having Limited break

Having enough break enables one's eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.

Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.

## 8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video

When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.

For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.

#### 1\. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation

The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17\. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.

The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.

Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.

#### 2\. Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones

Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.

With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

#### 3\. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment

A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.

When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

#### 4\. Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment

Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.

Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

#### 5\. Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity

Even though you can change your footage to black and white using the hue and saturation functionality, the black and white tool gives you more control.

This functionality feature can make your footage blend with the soft light part. Besides, it is best to first lower the contrast of your image or video to black and white to be able to highlight the unclear parts.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - change opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-5.jpg)

#### 6\. Use levels to unveil the whites, blacks, and mids of an image

Levels is a functionality feature that displays the blacks, whites, and mids of footage. With this functionality, you can make the highlight parts lighter and the shadows appear darker, which is essential in making cinematic videos.

In the levels histogram, the left slider defines the darkest part, the right defines the brightest part, and the top defines distributions.

In software such as Adobe After Effects, you can set this functionality to automatic or customize it based on your preference.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-6.jpg)

#### 7\. Use Vibrance to control other levels of saturation

The saturation of video footage or a clip can be regulated using vibrance functionality. With vibrance, you can alter the saturation levels of your clip while simultaneously minimizing clippings for the colors to approach complete saturation.

When you want to use this functionality in After Effects, you drag and drop it right on top of your footage – The exact part you want to apply it.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vibrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-7.jpg)

#### 8\. Use a Vignette to fade edges

To increase the point of focus, you need to fade your edges. In color grading, you can only fade your edges with a vignette.

This functionality allows you to center images or certain video parts and make the edges unclear. Your emphasis will be more on the central region.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use a vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-8.jpg)

## Bottom line

● Color grading is not a piece of cake. Besides, you should not use it as an excuse for making simple mistakes such as the ones highlighted above. You need to pay close attention when color grading your films, and you will have your video project mapping out its intended meaning.

● Moreover, you need not be a pro to carry out cinematic color grading. You need to follow the above eight tips altogether to apply color grading to your video. You will create stunning video files that leave your viewers' eyes gorged out.

This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.

#### 4\. Overusing LUTs

A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.

When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.

#### 5\. Having Limited break

Having enough break enables one's eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.

Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.

## 8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video

When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.

For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.

#### 1\. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation

The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17\. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.

The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.

Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.

#### 2\. Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones

Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.

With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

#### 3\. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment

A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.

When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

#### 4\. Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment

Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.

Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

#### 5\. Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity

Even though you can change your footage to black and white using the hue and saturation functionality, the black and white tool gives you more control.

This functionality feature can make your footage blend with the soft light part. Besides, it is best to first lower the contrast of your image or video to black and white to be able to highlight the unclear parts.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - change opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-5.jpg)

#### 6\. Use levels to unveil the whites, blacks, and mids of an image

Levels is a functionality feature that displays the blacks, whites, and mids of footage. With this functionality, you can make the highlight parts lighter and the shadows appear darker, which is essential in making cinematic videos.

In the levels histogram, the left slider defines the darkest part, the right defines the brightest part, and the top defines distributions.

In software such as Adobe After Effects, you can set this functionality to automatic or customize it based on your preference.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-6.jpg)

#### 7\. Use Vibrance to control other levels of saturation

The saturation of video footage or a clip can be regulated using vibrance functionality. With vibrance, you can alter the saturation levels of your clip while simultaneously minimizing clippings for the colors to approach complete saturation.

When you want to use this functionality in After Effects, you drag and drop it right on top of your footage – The exact part you want to apply it.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vibrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-7.jpg)

#### 8\. Use a Vignette to fade edges

To increase the point of focus, you need to fade your edges. In color grading, you can only fade your edges with a vignette.

This functionality allows you to center images or certain video parts and make the edges unclear. Your emphasis will be more on the central region.

## Bottom line

● Color grading is not a piece of cake. Besides, you should not use it as an excuse for making simple mistakes such as the ones highlighted above. You need to pay close attention when color grading your films, and you will have your video project mapping out its intended meaning.

● Moreover, you need not be a pro to carry out cinematic color grading. You need to follow the above eight tips altogether to apply color grading to your video. You will create stunning video files that leave your viewers' eyes gorged out.

## How to Add a Green Screen to Zoom

If you are a regular user of Zoom app because you have to attend meetings and video conferences every now and then, you should know how to create a green screen for Zoom calls. There are going to be times when you would not want to show what is in your background because it might look distracting. Besides, changing the background from time to time breaks the monotony of your Zoom calls.

Zoom app allows you to change your background and set any available virtual background. However, the effect of virtual background may not be accurate and smooth unless you have a uniform background color. If you use green screen background for Zoom, you can replace it with any virtual background that will look very realistic to your audiences. We will illustrate how to create a green screen background for Zoom.

## Part 1\. How to add green screen to Zoom on computer?

Regular Zoom users prefer arranging and attending video conferences from their computers. Zoom desktop app makes it more convenient to attend Zoom conference with a wider screen and better visibility. Make sure you have a uniform green screen in your background before attending Zoom call so that you can replace it with any available virtual background on Zoom. Here are the steps on how to create a green screen for Zoom app on your computer.

Step1Open Zoom app and make sure you are logged into your account. Adjust the webcam so that only you and your green screen should be visible in the frame.

Step2Click on Settings (gear icon) located in the top-right corner.

![click zoom settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-zoom-settings.jpg)

Step3Once Settings window opens, click on Virtual background option on the left panel.

## Part 2\. How to add green screen to Zoom on mobile?

If you are an occasional Zoom user, you are more likely to use your smartphone to attend Zoom conferences. If you want green screen effect on your Zoom call, make sure you have a sizeable green screen in your background. This is because even if you happen to move your phone during the meeting, green screen background should come in the video frame all the time.

It is recommended to use a tripod to keep your smartphone fixed in one spot for better and consistent green screen effect. Here are the steps to answer your question how do you add a green screen to Zoom app on your mobile phone. The steps are the same for Android and iOS users.

Step1Open Zoom app on your smartphone and make sure you are signed into your account.

Step5Tap on Close option and the selected virtual background will be applied to your Zoom video.

## Part 3\. Tips to use green screen on Zoom video

Here are some important tips to use green screen on Zoom video for a better outcome.

Buy Large Green Screen - Since you are going to invest in buying green screen, you should buy a large green screen instead of buying two. Firstly, when you have one large green screen, you can set it up without any wrinkles or overlaps.

Secondly, a large green screen means greater surface area, and even when you slightly change the angle of your camera, your background will still have green screen instead of the exterior wall showing up and ruining virtual background effect.

Buy Green Screen Stand - Along with green screen, you should buy a sizeable green screen stand. A regular green screen stand contains two vertical supports at both ends and one horizontal support where you hand the green screen.

You can buy it according to the size of green screen you have bought. And you need to buy stand because you cannot fix the green screen on the wall properly. If you use any other means, there are going to be wrinkles and uneven virtual background effect.

Green Screen Quality - You can purchase any shade of green screen, but we recommend you opt for vibrant green color for a better outcome. Most importantly, the color should be even across the surface, and there should not be light and dark patches to dampen the virtual background effect and make it look unrealistic. That is why you should not compromise with quality.

Avoid Green Objects - You should not wear anything green. If your green screen has a lighter shade, you can wear deep color dresses and vice versa. Most importantly, you should not keep anything that is green while attending Zoom attending as it will disturb the green screen effect and it will look embarrassing. If you need to keep any green objects in your Zoom meetings, you should have blue screen instead of green screen.

Focus On Lighting - Lighting is extremely important when you want to use green screen. You should place the light so that it spreads evenly across the green screen. Otherwise, there are going to be light and dark patches, and the effect can get disturbed. Make sure you do not cast any shadow on the green screen by positioning the green screen accordingly.

Select A Proper Background - Last but not least, when you change your green screen to any virtual background photo or video, make sure you keep your audiences in mind. If you are attending a meeting, you should keep a professional-looking background. The background should not be distracting and match the theme of your meeting.

## Conclusion

We have answered your question, “How do you add a green screen to zoom?” You can use green screen on your Zoom desktop app as well as smartphone app. This will help you to make your usual background cover up with green screen and replace green screen with any virtual background. Keep in mind all the tips we have provided you so that the green screen effect is perfect.

### New Features

* **Separates the Object:** RSMB Pro has the additional capability to isolate the background and foreground effectively. It utilizes a specified matte that can help in object separation to create motion blur with great precision. (Not available with Movie Studio, Vegas Pro, Catalyst Edit, Smoke, Media Composer, Flame, or Nucoda)
* **Blur with Motion Vectors:** If you have imported a 3D animation video, the pro version can blur the motion vectors provided by you. Thus, it can work on a 3D animation system perfectly. (Not available with Vegas Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Movie Studio, Media Composer, Catalyst Edit, or Nucoda)

By defining the tracking points, you can tell RSMB about the movement of one pixel from one frame to another efficiently.

* **Spline Guidance:** If RSMB encounters problems related to tracking, you can draw and animate shapes to tell about the object's movement.

## Part 1: Where does it come from?

AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) is a new video compression format that is being developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). AOMedia is a consortium of major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon. The AV1 codec is an improvement on VP9 in several ways, most notably in its ability to compress video more efficiently.

Although the AV1 codec is still in the early stages of development, it is already being adopted by some major tech companies. Netflix has announced that it will start using AV1 for its streaming service, and Google has said that AV1 will be the default codec for YouTube.

### The benefits of the new codec

Two of the most popular video formats, provide high-quality video at a relatively low bit rate.

The new AV1 codec offers several benefits for streaming platforms and their users. Take a look at a few of them:

1. **Lower bitrate**
1. **Reduced costs for encoding**

For streaming platforms, AV1 could lead to reducing costs for encoding as well as increasing quality and compatibility. For users, AV1 could improve streaming quality, especially on mobile devices.

1. **Smaller size with better quality**

**AV1 files** will take up less space on your hard drive or be smaller in file size when streamed online. Since AV1 can compress video files to a much smaller size without sacrificing quality, users will be able to save data when streaming video on their devices!

1. **More efficient**

AV1 will use less processing power to decode a video compared to other video codecs. As a result, the streaming platforms can save on bandwidth costs, which can be passed on to users in the form of lower subscription prices eventually.

1. **Royalty-free**

The ultimate goal of AOMedia is to develop an open and royalty-free video codec that can be used by anyone. So, you will have better video quality, lower bandwidth costs, and faster loading times.

AV1 is just one of the many new technologies that are revolutionizing online media delivery. With its superior quality and efficiency, AV1 is poised to become the standard codec for online video in the years to come where everyone can access more affordable and high-quality videos.

## Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?

As we have already discussed, AV1 is a newer codec that promises better compression. This video format has already been widely used and gaining traction in the streaming industry. It is being used more for live broadcasts and other time-sensitive applications.

#### Who will prevail?

![video editing program on a computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-3.jpg)

Since both codecs have their pros and cons, it's unclear which one will ultimately prevail. However, as the world moves towards more open standards for video codecs, there is growing concern that AV1 codec will be used to monopolize the market. While AV1 is free to use, it is encumbered by patents held by members of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), which includes companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

The EU Commissions' questionnaire, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-eu-antitrust-regulators-probing-tech-group-aoms-video-licensing-policy-2022-07-07/), unveiled that the alliance and its members had been requiring companies to cross-license their patents for no charge to receive the AV1 format. These companies had no affiliation with AOM when AV1 was originally devised. This was a non-negotiable requisite for companies who owned patents that were necessary to contribute to the AV1 standard's technical specifications.

As a result, this action is concerned to hinder innovation and thus prevents the new entities feasible to flourish. Therefore, there is a growing movement to antitrust AV1 which has been investigated by the European Commission.

The European Commission is looking into whether this licensing scheme violates antitrust law and whether the companies involved are colluding to keep AV1 closed off to competitors. The investigation is in its early stages, and no formal charges have been filed against Google at this time.

However, if the Commission finds that Google has indeed abused its market position, it could order Google to make changes to AV1 or face steep fines. Although the fines have yet to be determined, each company involved could ultimately pay up to 10% of their global turnover.

Nonetheless, this issue has shed light on the competitive landscape of the codec market. Well, although the outcome of the antitrust investigation is still uncertain, it is clear that it has the potential to shake up the codec market.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
H.266 is the next-generation video codec that is being developed to improve upon the current standard and the latest advances in video technology. We can expect H.266 to continue to evolve and be improved upon as time goes on. Some of their transcendence that you can look forward to:

* **Improve compression efficiency**

H.266/VVC is designed to improve compression efficiency by 20-50% over previous versions. You can have a video of the same file size and bit rate but make it look significantly better.

* **Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP) usage**

The H.266 codec uses a new type of inter-frame prediction called Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP). ILP allows the codec to exploit the correlations between different layers of a video signal. Therefore, it gives better results on image quality and file size when you encode a video with the H.266 codec.

* **Higher-quality video**

We can expect higher-quality video content to become more widespread. This new codec will also enable new types of content, such as virtual reality and 360-degree video, to be streamed and enjoyed by a wider audience.

### AV2 codec

The AV2 codec is an improvement on the current AV1\. The AV2 codec is said to be more efficient and have better quality than the AV1 codec. It is still in development and is not yet available for use.

Since this codec is expected to provide better quality video at lower bit rates than other codecs, it would be ideal for use in video applications such as streaming and video conferencing. So, what can we expect from the AV2 codec in the future? Here are a few things to look out for:

* Improved quality at lower bitrates
* Wider adoption in streaming and conferencing applications
* Continued development and improvement

## 7 Tips to Create Teaching Videos

For many teachers, online classes begin with a live recording of their lectures or lessons. Sending the recorded lectures to the students allows them to pause the video and rewatch it multiple times.

Recording lectures before class can assist lecturers in filling gaps that may arise due to your absence. You don't have to worry about missing lessons if you're going on vacation or to be sick for an extended time.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
You can keep the class continuing even if you are absent by using pre-recorded lectures and sending the file to the class, so they know the lesson. With the help of an online lecture software or tool available on the internet, you can download it free.

These are the steps in creating an instructional video in your classes:

## Know Your Target Audience

Before you record the video to present in your classes, you need to **know your target audience**. We all know that some teachers handle grade school, and some handle high school level. We need to discover what kind of knowledge or skills your students hope to gain in your class learning the topic you presented. Try to use your book, or maybe add some research and then use that information to help you discuss with your students.

![know your target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Things you need to remember before you proceed to the next step:

* Who is your audience? We, educators, already know our audience. It depends on the school and what level we are going to handle. It's either grade school level or high school level.
* What is your topic/s? There are a lot of topics and subjects in the field of teaching but try to pick only one topic or subject to present to your class. For example, Computer Subject because I'm a computer teacher. I will be using this subject or topic about computers to create my instructional video for the class.
* What is the learning objective or learning outcome of your video? The learning objective of your video is the outcome that captures precisely what knowledge, skills, and attitudes the students should be able to exhibit following the instructions.
* How will your video benefit your audience? The students will learn and understand the lesson you are discussing, helping them gain knowledge of that subject to answer all the assignments, quizzes, or maybe an activity you will give them.

## Write a Script

Once you know your audience and have the topic you need, it's time to **write a script**. Think about your plan for presenting your video in your classes.

![write video script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/write-video-script.jpg)

* Here are a few more writing script tips to help you in your classes:

Go to the mirror and practice. This tip may help some teachers instead of calling their loved ones and getting feedback about the script they write.

* Explain what you're doing and why you're doing it. You are not only presenting the topic and explaining it but also showing the class what the topic is all about, which will be suitable for your students. Present some examples, pictures, or videos for them to know better what your discussion is all about.
* Knowing your script 100% is important. Make sure that you already know your script before you record. If you forget something or make a mistake, go back to the beginning and repeat it correctly. Remember as a teacher that we are not allowed to make mistakes in the eyes of the students. So, double-check everything before you record it and show it to the class.

## Record the Narration

After writing your script, let's try to **record the narration**. You don't need any application software where you can record the narration. Simply using your mobile phone and having a good background is enough.

![record narration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/record-narration.jpg)

Using a microphone to record the narration is necessary. Getting those headphones with one connected microphone is good. Some of that has noise cancellation, providing a much better sound quality while recording and ensuring that your videos don't contain background noise. Then, find a quiet place to record. Explain to your family members that no one will ever talk loud or shout while you are recording the narration.

Once you are ready to hit that record button, speak clearly. Nobody is perfect, so it's ok if you make a mistake. You don't need to start over, just pause and start again. You can remove the error or mistake by editing your finished product. Make sure your narration will be the same on the screen while recording your video.

## Record and Edit your Video

The first thing you need to do in **recording your video** is to clean up your computer screen and close all the unnecessary applications. You need to turn off also the notifications that will pop up on your computer before you start recording. You can also add your recorded narration to your video.

Here are a few simple tips for **editing your video**:

* Add some interactive elements like motions to highlight key points of your video.
* Adding music to your video is optional but may elevate a decent video to the next level. Pick something cheery. You want your audience to feel good while learning.

## The Video Duration

I'd say it's one of the first things students look at before they click the 'play' button of the video. It will benefit both teacher and the students if the video is brief and direct to the point. Some students are more likely to want a short video, or maybe let's focus on the time between 20 - 30 minutes video, where they can watch and learn on any platform, anytime. After that, you can add time by adding other pieces of information and giving activities and assignments.

## Be Yourself

Be yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes sometimes. Make sure that your personality shines throughout the video. Try to research how some teachers or maybe some speakers speak naturally and have a conversational manner with an enthusiastic tone.

When you are recording yourself talking, look right at the camera so students can feel eye contact with you, even if it is online. Sometimes we forget the words we need to say to the class, so try to prepare a note next to your webcam. The messages you prepare will help you don't look away from the camera all the time. Don't pretend to the class that you're reading something, just talk naturally as you would in real classrooms.

## Sharing your Video

Instead of sharing your recorded video with your students, you can also share it directly to online video platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo or save the video as a local file to upload on a social media platform. They can go there and watch the video. You can also upload your file to the school learning management system like Google Classroom. Please take note of this; before sending the recorded video to your students, share it with first to a few people to get some video feedback about what you created. This might help you ensure that your message is clear and that your video accomplishes your goals for your students.

There's a chance that your recorded video doesn't meet your requirements or you are not satisfied with that for the first time. Don't worry; try it again, even if you recorded it once or several times. You need to trust yourself by doing it because we are teachers; we are doing our best for the students to learn something from us.

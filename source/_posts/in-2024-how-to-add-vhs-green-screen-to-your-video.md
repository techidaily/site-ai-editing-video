Reverb Effect – In this video effect, you see a particular scene reverberating, especially when the subject goes into imagining things and recalling memories. You can add reverb to video online when there is a jump cut scene in your video to smoothen the transition.

Transition Effect – Transition effect is a special type of video effects that you insert when you are making a transition from one scene to another. Transition effects smoothen the scene cuts for the eyes of the audience and refresh the mind to let them focus on the next scene.

Step1: The first step is to install the presets in your After Effects presets folder. After downloading and unzipping the free presets, copy and paste them.

Step2: As soon as you have copied the presets to the AE presets folder, you can open a PP project and replace the effects in your videos by choosing: Replace with After Effects Composition.

Step3: Verify the composition settings in Premiere Pro, and see if 4K or FHD are selected.

Step4: If you want to start adding presets to NULL objects, you can do so by creating them. To add Motion Blur, you will need footage and the overall composition. Next, you can adjust keyframes and use Motion Tiles.

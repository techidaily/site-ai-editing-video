## Part 1: Learning the Best Ways to Add Slow Motion in DaVinci Resolve \[100% Working\]

Post-production editing is what adds value and perfection to your shots. [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) is an all-in-one editor designed to assist in post-production tasks. You can do professional-level editing, apply effects, infuse cinematic visuals, and more. In addition, it possesses multipurpose high-grade audio editing tools for videos.

With its custom settings options, you can create slow motions in DaVinci Resolve. It has multiple options for manipulating the speed of the entire video clip. With its speed ramping option, you can slow down a specific portion of the video. The Optical Flow feature in it brings precision to your slow-motion videos. If you want to get rid of switching between software, DaVinci slow motion is an option.

### Methods of Creating Slow Motion Videos in DaVinci Resolve 18

There are multiple options and techniques for producing **slow-motion DaVinci Resolve**. The following section contains the step-by-step guide to doing that:

* [Method 1\. Using the Timeline Settings](#method1)

#### Method 1\. Using the Timeline Settings

Are you looking for a speedy and straightforward method to slow down a video? In this **DaVinci Resolve slow motion smooth**, speed is adjustable via percentage. Here is a step-by-step guide to commence this action in DaVinci:

**Step 1:** After importing your clip into this software, bring it to the timeline. Then, right-click on this clip in the timeline; a selection panel will appear. In this panel, locate the "Retime Controls" option and click it.

![access remote controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-in-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Commencing this action will feature a speed change option on your clip. Click on the navigation icon adjacent to the speed percentage in the timeline clip.

**Step 3:** There is a built-in option to bring smoothness to your slow-motion video. For this, select your clip and navigate towards the top-right panel.

Discord was a great alternative to voice chat systems such as TeamSpeak, Mumble, and Ventrilo for online gamers. Gamers **make discord accounts** for these services to play together rather than the voice communication facilities integrated into games, which are frequently of poor quality and lack functionality.

Founded in 2015, discord allowed individuals to talk while playing PC games seamlessly. Users may utilize the service to establish servers that can include many text and audio channels. A typical **discord account** server may feature chat rooms dedicated to specific themes (such as "gaming" and "anime x manga"), as well as voice channels devoted to specific games or activities. The service's high-quality, low-latency audio chat is a popular tool for Twitch broadcasters and podcasters. It has also expanded to accommodate massive video conversations to compete with Zoom.

**Discord account** allows friends to communicate with one another one-on-one or in groups via a server.

You can share many things on discord, including media files like images, gifs, audio, and videos.

**What Happens When You Disable your Discord Account?**

When you deactivate your account, it goes to suspension mode. You may reactivate it by signing in and following the on-screen instructions. Keep in mind that **discord accounts** dormant for two years are removed, so if you want to keep yours, you must reactivate it (but you can disable it after this if you like).

After you deactivate an account, users will no longer get discord alerts. Users may, however, still receive friend requests, and any friend requests users get while their account is blocked will be ready for when they reactivate it. However, when a user decides to delete their account, the said account will get permanently deleted.

Tip: If you want to stay away from your **discord account** for a while with a plan to return to it later, it is advisable to log out or deactivate rather than delete it.

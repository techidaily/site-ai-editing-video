## Steps to Rotate Videos Using Handbrake

Handbrake is a video editing tool that allows you to rotate videos. It is a free and open source software that is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is used to convert video files from one format to another. You can use it to compress videos, add subtitles, or create chapters. It also allows you to rotate videos in different directions. You can use it to fix videos that are not aligned properly or that have been filmed upside down. A handbrake is a popular tool because it is easy to use and it has a variety of features.

## Step-by-step on how to rotate videos using Handbrake

When you import a video into the Handbrake software, it will by default be in a "landscape" orientation, with the long edge of the video oriented horizontally. If you want to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise so that it appears "vertical," or if you want to rotate it 180 degrees so that it is upside down, you can do so by following these two steps:

Step 1: Open the Handbrake software and import your video.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-1.png)

Step 2: Click on the "Dimensions" tab at the top of the Handbrake window.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-2.png)

Step 3: Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, click on one of the options in the "Rotate" menu.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-3.png)

Step 4: If you want to rotate a video 90 degrees counterclockwise, select "90 Degrees CW (Counter-Clockwise)." If you want to rotate the video 180 degrees so that it is upside down, select "180 Degrees."

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-4.png)

Step 5: Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-5.png)

The Handbrake software also offers a "Flip" option which you can do after rotating it, which allows you to slip the video after rotating it. To use this option, follow these steps:

Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, Go to Rotation and choose the degrees that best is best for your rotation requirements.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-6.png)

Click on "Flip" to flip your video horizontally.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-7.png)

Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

Both of these methods for rotating videos are easy to use and produce good results. Experiment with them to see which method works best for you.

## 4 Methods to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great video editing software that comes with a lot of features. You can easily perform basic editing techniques in a few minutes. It also comes with lots of filters to make your videos pop.

For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

**Step 1**: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.

**Step 2**: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.

**Step 3**: Change your aspect ratio. When you launch Filmora, you’re allowed to choose your preferred aspect ratio on the start page.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-1.png)

Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.

You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-2.png)

**Step 4**: Import your WebM video. After you must have selected your preferred aspect ratio, the next step is to import the video you want to resize; you can do this by clicking on the import icon shown below. Once done, drag the video to the timeline also shown below.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-3.png)

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-4.png)

A floating window will appear and you’ll be asked to change project settings to match the media. Click on ‘Keep project settings’. Filmora will change the aspect ratio of the original video you imported to your preferred aspect ratio.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-6.png)

**Step 5**: Save your video. Once the video is now properly placed in the timeline, next thing is hit ‘export’ to save your video. You can go to the ‘format tab’ to change the video output format to WebM or whatever format you choose then hit ‘Export’.

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-8.png)

**Step 5**: Click "Add". You can load one or more video files. Here, I'll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click "Convert / Save" again.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-9.png)

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-10.png)

**Step 6**: Choose your desired output profile type. With VLC, you can resize video to MP4, WebM, TS, and other formats.

**Step 8**: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-8.png)

**Step 5**: Click "Add". You can load one or more video files. Here, I'll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click "Convert / Save" again.

Alternatively, you can go to the "Effects" menu, which is at the left-hand side of your interface, then select "Color Correction"> "Lumetri Color."

![how to use lumetri color in after effects- open lumetri color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-4.jpg)

### Step 3\. Carry out your Color Grading and Saturation

With the "Lumetri Color" functionality, you can carry out various adjustable settings such as tone, hue, saturation and color grading.

To carry out saturation:

Click on the " Hue/Saturation " from the drop-down menu in "Lumetri Color." You can change the color of the entire footage by adjusting the "Master Hue" from the Effects Control Panel.

Alternatively, you can opt to fine-tune the freshly selected color by using the "Master Saturation" and Master Lightness."

To carry out color grading:

* After opening the "Lumetri Color" panel as in step 2 above, click on the eyedropper to select the curve you want to use.
* Click the color in your footage that you wish to adjust. Usually, when you use the eyedropper, three points will be added to the graph. The two bottom points restrict color selection to a minimum range, whereas the first represents your selected color.

### How to Use Lumetri Scope

Besides the Lumetric Color, Lumetric Scope is another essential tool for post-film production in Adobe After Effects. The color correcting tool, Lumetric scope guarantees its users' accurate results when used correctly.

When carrying out color corrections in films, it is advisable to use quality monitor calibrators and paint your workspace walls neutral grey. Usually, it reduces lighting distraction and the external color effect, respectively.

However, not every editor can meet all the required basics, and that is where Lumetri scope comes in. Lumetri Scope allows one to get the best color results in their videos. Here are the steps on how to use Lumetri Scope:

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-6.jpg)

### Step 1\. Open Lumetric Scope

First, open your Adobe After Effect application and add your footage to the timeline. Go to the " Window " menu at the top-left-hand side of your interface.

In the drop-down menu, select "Lumetri Scopes" or "Workspaces," then click on the "Color" option.

The Lumetri Scope tab will be displayed adjacent to the timeline footage.

### Step 2\. Evaluate Hue and Saturation using Vectorscope

In the Lumetri Scope tab, click on the wrench icon, and a drop-down menu will be displayed. From the menu, select "Vectorscope YUV" and read the saturation. When reading saturation, begin from the center going outwards.

Hue, on the other hand, is read in a circular direction.

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects - evaluate hue and Saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-7.jpg)

### Step 3\. Evaluate the tonal values and Brightness using Histogram

The histogram in Lumetri Scope displays an image's tonal values and brightness levels.

To measure the brightness and tonal values, go back to the Lumetri Scope panel and click on the wrench icon. Click on "Presets" from the drop-down menu and select "Histogram."

The scale in the histogram starts from 0 (pure black) to 225 (pure white). You, therefore, need to view the number of pixels for every color horizontally when reading.

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects - evaluate tonal and brightness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-8.jpg)

### Step 4\. Evaluate Color and Brightness Intensities using Waveform Monitor

The color and brightness are read from the bottom to the top in the waveform monitor.

Click on the wrench icon to view the intensities, then pick the "Presets" option > “Waveform RBG.” A drop-down menu (RGB, YC, Luma, and YC no Chroma) will be displayed that allows you to do the readings.

Reading the IRE scale is usually done in ascension (0 to 100).

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects - evaluate color and brigntess intensities](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-9.jpg)

### Step 5\.  Evaluate the Individual color channels using Parade Scope

Here, click on the wrench icon in the Lumetri Scopes panel, then select the "Presets"> "Parade RGB." Select from the alternate Lumetri scope combinations of RGB, RGB-White, YUV, YUV white.

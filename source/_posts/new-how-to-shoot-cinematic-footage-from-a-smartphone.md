## How to Shoot Cinematic Footage From a Smartphone

Creating cinematic videos is easy if you have expensive equipment like a film set with high-quality cameras. But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.

You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don't have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.

But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!

## Part 1\. What Is a Cinematic Video?

The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.

Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., **IMAX** cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.

With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.

Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!

## Part 2\. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video

To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:

### 1\. A Gimbal Stabilizer

When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.

If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.

A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the **Q3** Gimbal from **Zhiyun**.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-1.png)

You can also connect the Gimbal from its app. Scroll below to learn more about the app!

**Zhiyun Cami App**

**Zhiyun Q3** stabilizer also connects with the Zhiyun cami app. This app will allow users to access the filming features more intuitively and comprehensively. You can connect your Gimbal with the app via Bluetooth.

![zhiyun cami app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-2.png)

**Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes**

There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:

* **The Locking mode:** This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.
* **The POV mode** will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.

![the different modes of zhiyun q3 stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-3.png)

**Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer**

When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in **flashlight.**

This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal flashlight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-4.png)

You can also turn the flashlight towards yourself if you are recording a Vlog or taking a selfie. The light’s temperature is 4300K, giving a relatively warm light on the subject.

![spectrum of light indicating 4300k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-5.png)

### 2\. A Good Smartphone

Most smartphones these days are equipped with cameras with varying powers of recording. Some smartphone cameras focus on **Mega Pixels,** while others focus on the capture sensor. You need a smartphone camera that balances out all these qualities to record cinematic footage.

The recently released iPhone 14 pro camera is an excellent example of a good quality camera you can use to record cinematic videos.

![smartphone attached to gimbal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-6.png)

### 3\. Video Editing Software

There is no better software in the video editing field than the infamous Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to edit high-quality videos with creative features.

Wondershare Filmora allows access to the range of effects and filters you can apply to your videos to give them a more cinematic look. It also allows you to access the vast library of audio to utilize in your videos. Moreover, its engaging UI allows beginners to access to features of Wondershare Filmora easily.

![wondershare filmora website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-7.png)

Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.

## Part 3\. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone

You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.

Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.

* The Reveal Movement.
* The 180° Presentation Movement.
* The Following Movement.

First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.

### 1\. The Reveal Movement

This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.

The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.

To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:

* First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the **Gimbal**.
* **Align** your Smartphone camera behind the static object.
* Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.
* Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.

![the reveal movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-8.gif)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.

Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in **Locking mode**. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.

![gimbal fixed in locking mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-9.png)

### 2\. The 180° Presentation Movement

The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.

Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.

As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the **POV** **mode** of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.

![gimbal fixed in pov mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-10.png)

Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:

* First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.
* Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.
* When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.
* When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.

![the 180° presentation movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-11.gif)

By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”

### 3\. The Following Movement

You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.

The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.

![drawing a square to focus the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-12.png)

To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:

* When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.
* After that, open the **Cami** app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.
* Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.

![the following movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-13.gif)

This is how you will create the following movement.

## Part 1: How to Utilize Track Mattes in Adobe After Effects?

[After Effects by Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) is a software application dedicated to visual effects and [motion graphics](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for videos.

### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

##### Step 3

You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add **alpha matte in After Effects** or other types from here.

![use switches to add track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-4.jpg)

## Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps

Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using **After Effects mask tracking**, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use **Track Mask in After Effects**, you can follow these steps:

##### Step 1

Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.

![use pen tool to mark boundary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

##### Step 2

Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select "Track Mask." This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the "Method" option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn't moving much, you can choose a simple option such as "Position."

![set method for tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-6.jpg)

##### Step 3

## Part 1: How to Utilize Track Mattes in Adobe After Effects?

[After Effects by Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) is a software application dedicated to visual effects and [motion graphics](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for videos. The tool is commonly used in the post-production process of videos. The wide toolset of After Effects can be useful in filmmaking, video gaming, and TV. After Effects offers everything you need to take your creative inspirations to the next level.

* **Motion Graphics:** After Effects lets users animate characters and backgrounds in videos. You can generate 3-dimensional models from 2D animations. After Effects also supports the animation of logos to bring your elements to life.
* **Rotoscoping:** You can remove elements or drop new ones in your video using After Effects. The Roto Brush Tool can easily separate the background and foreground. You can then replace unwanted objects and replace them with new elements.
* **Motion Tracking:** Tracking the movement of an object is quite simple in After Effects. You can pin any element to a moving object. The smooth dynamics can enhance the overall result of the footage.
* **VFX and Special Effects:** After Effects is the perfect tool to add special effects to your videos. Its VFX tool lets users add magic to the footage. You can make objects disappear, control the weather, stabilize your video, and more.

### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

##### Step 3

You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add **alpha matte in After Effects** or other types from here.

![use switches to add track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-4.jpg)

## Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps

Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using **After Effects mask tracking**, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use **Track Mask in After Effects**, you can follow these steps:

##### Step 1

Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.

![use pen tool to mark boundary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

##### Step 2

Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select "Track Mask." This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the "Method" option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn't moving much, you can choose a simple option such as "Position."

![set method for tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-6.jpg)

##### Step 3

Tap the "Analyze Forward" icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set "Mask Mode" from the timeline to "Subtract." This will remove the selected object from the clip.

![analyze and change mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-7.jpg)

02 [How to Ace an AI Video Interview](#Part 2)

03 [Role of AI in a Video Interview](#Part 3)

04 [Role of AI in Video Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How AI is being used in a job interview.**

In most cases, **an AI video interview** is the initial stage in the hiring process, in place of or in addition to a typical cover letter and CV. It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

### 01**Prepare for the interview differently.**

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

When in an **AI interview**, you need to prepare differently. It's not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

Remember that you're having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

Most **artificial intelligence video interviews** take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it's essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

There won't be a human at the other end of the camera, so there's no need to dress up, right? That's wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.

Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.

### 05**Practice before the interview.**

![Practice Before the Interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-5.jpeg)

To ace an **AI interview**, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an **AI interview**. To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye
        Contact and Neutral Voice Tone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-8.jpeg)

During an **AI video interview**, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don't have to strain to see into it. Avoid looking away all of the time; this can give the impression of being distracted and unfocused. Speak neutrally or brightly. Remember that the AI analyzes your speech tone and mannerisms. As a result, speaking in clear tones can help you succeed.

### 09**Maintain proper body posture and even talking speed**

![Maintain Proper Body Posture and talk speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-9.jpg)

Ensure to carry yourself the same way as you would in an in-person human interview because a human interviewer will watch your interview at some point. You emphasize more confidence when you sit up straight, Sit with an open posture, avoid crossed arms or legs, keep your chin towards your stomach, and do not hunch your shoulders or recline on the chair. Appear in control, natural, and ready to handle any question. Try to keep your talking speed at a conversational rate, and avoid talking too fast or too slow because it might come off as you being nervous or unsure of yourself.

### 10**Make use of keywords**

![Make Use of Keywords](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-10.jpg)

The use of keywords is essential in any job application process. Meanwhile, AI algorithms pick out keywords in a candidate's response during an interview. Stand out during an **AI interview** by using phrases that explain what you can contribute, echoing the exact language of the job posting. Before the **AI-based video interview**, carefully go through the job description and note what keywords the company uses to describe the role on the company website or job posting page. Be sure to use their words specifically.

## Part 3 **Role of AI in a video interview**

![AI in Job interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-11.jpg)

AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates' responses. Many significant companies use **AI video interviews** or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant's performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company's ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate's speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.

## Part 4 **Role of AI in video making**

In video production, artificial intelligence has proven faster and more efficient than humans. It's also more cost-effective and time-saving than hiring a video editor. It allows you to edit more films in a shorter amount of time. It streamlines your job by taking care of most of the burden, making video editing simple even for beginners. AI makes suggestions that the user may not consider, making video production more accessible and engaging. Automating color correction and scene recognition in films improves the visual experience and aids in the formulation of personalized messaging.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

### 01**Prepare for the interview differently.**

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

When in an **AI interview**, you need to prepare differently. It's not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

Remember that you're having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

Most **artificial intelligence video interviews** take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it's essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

There won't be a human at the other end of the camera, so there's no need to dress up, right? That's wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.

Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.

### 05**Practice before the interview.**

![Practice Before the Interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-5.jpeg)

To ace an **AI interview**, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an **AI interview**. To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye
        Contact and Neutral Voice Tone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-8.jpeg)

During an **AI video interview**, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don't have to strain to see into it. Avoid looking away all of the time; this can give the impression of being distracted and unfocused. Speak neutrally or brightly. Remember that the AI analyzes your speech tone and mannerisms. As a result, speaking in clear tones can help you succeed.

### 09**Maintain proper body posture and even talking speed**

![Maintain Proper Body Posture and talk speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-9.jpg)

You emphasize more confidence when you sit up straight, Sit with an open posture, avoid crossed arms or legs, keep your chin towards your stomach, and do not hunch your shoulders or recline on the chair. Appear in control, natural, and ready to handle any question. Try to keep your talking speed at a conversational rate, and avoid talking too fast or too slow because it might come off as you being nervous or unsure of yourself.

### 10**Make use of keywords**

![Make Use of Keywords](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-10.jpg)

The use of keywords is essential in any job application process. Meanwhile, AI algorithms pick out keywords in a candidate's response during an interview. Stand out during an **AI interview** by using phrases that explain what you can contribute, echoing the exact language of the job posting. Before the **AI-based video interview**, carefully go through the job description and note what keywords the company uses to describe the role on the company website or job posting page. Be sure to use their words specifically.

![AI in Job interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-11.jpg)

AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates' responses. Many significant companies use **AI video interviews** or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant's performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company's ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate's speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.

## Part 4 **Role of AI in video making**

In video production, artificial intelligence has proven faster and more efficient than humans. It's also more cost-effective and time-saving than hiring a video editor. It allows you to edit more films in a shorter amount of time. It streamlines your job by taking care of most of the burden, making video editing simple even for beginners. AI makes suggestions that the user may not consider, making video production more accessible and engaging. Automating color correction and scene recognition in films improves the visual experience and aids in the formulation of personalized messaging.

## How to Use Rule of Thirds in Video

So you have your work flow sorted out and you're well on your way with Filmora but you're not quite happy with your results or something just seems off when you watch your videos back. You may be missing an important element of all visual media and that's composition. This is where the building blocks of every frame come together to make a visually pleasing piece for the viewer and helps the eyes concentrate on the content rather than trying to figure out what they are looking at.

I'm sure you may have heard of the rule of thirds for art or photography and you may not know or understand what it is. You may even be wondering how the rule of thirds can help you with your video creation. Well, that is what I'm going to show and explain to you today.

## What is the rule of thirds

At its core the rule of thirds is a guide to follow whenever you create something visual.

You break an image into thirds both horizontally and vertically, in doing this you are left with nine boxes and four gridlines, the rule states that by placing key elements in line with gridlines you will have an overall better composition.

To gain a better understanding of this here is a visual example of the gridlines and nine boxes.

![rule of thirds gridline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/rule-of-thirds-gridline.jpg)

This may seem simple but is often overlooked due to time restraints and eagerness to get that video out there. By following these guidelines your overall composition will gain interesting and pleasing results that can help with viewer engagement. This is only one piece of the puzzle but as any photography professional or artist will tell you, It's the small things that add up.

## How to use the rule of thirds

To show how to use the rule of thirds I will be showing an image with and without the use of the guidelines. In doing this you will be able to see how impactful this system is and how it can help with your own creations within [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

This will be our scene example, you can see buildings, boats, water and skyline. This may be typical of a backdrop or an insert for a holiday picture amongst many other things.

I will now show this picture with no compositional thought and without the use of the thirds system.

![shoot a scene with three thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-a-scene-with-three-thirds.jpg)

Notice how all the elements are in the scene but it just looks interesting and something just seems off when you look at it. You may find yourself searching for understanding of the image rather than taking the image in and concentrating on what the creator intended. This is seen commonly due to the need to fit every element in the scene but sometimes it is best to sacrifice something you may see as important for the sake of the whole picture.

We will now look at the example image with the rule of thirds in place and see if overall this makes a more interesting scene.

![place thirds points in photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/place-thirds-points-in-photo.jpg)

We have aligned the skyline with the first horizontal grid line and aligned the boats with the vertical grid lines. We have sacrificed the crane in the scene but overall I'm sure you can agree that this is more pleasing and makes more sense when you're viewing this. The whole middle section of the scene now has information within it and the contrast between the middle and the rest of the scene directs your eyes to what was intended to be viewed, This is called effect use of empty space. In doing this you save yourself time from adding more information to direct the viewer.

Placing key elements directly in the center of your scene can seem static and boring but by placing elements to one side or using the first and second horizontal grid lines you create something called Dynamism , where the viewer sees an element along the grid and takes a journey through the rest of the image.

Studies have shown that this is the humans natural way of viewing imagery, we first find something interesting to look at and then journey around that. So by using this rule you are creating a more natural process for your viewer.

## Tips when starting using the rule of thirds

The first tip I would say is to view other videos, YouTube is a good starting point. Watch interviews and notice where the chairs are aligned. Watch reviewers and notice where they position themselves in the scene. Lastly watch movies and pause on an interesting scene and try to deconstruct where everything is placed and why they chose that composition.

The idea with the rule is to have it become something you do naturally, by always considering the form you save yourself time in the editing process. The key things you have in your mind whenever you make a scene should be.

1\. What is the key element in my scene or what am I trying to make the viewer focus on.

2\. where do I intend to place these in my scene?

3\. Have I created a balanced scene with enough negative space to direct the eye.

If you consider this with every video you make then in time this will become as natural as drinking water on a hot day. As a practice you could open some old projects and apply this rule to your video to see the results and you may find yourself impressed with the change.

**When is it best to not use the rule of thirds?**

The rule is very useful when you're aiming to grab the attention towards a certain element but that being said, when you have a symmetrical scene you can get away with not using the rule as your eyes can make sense of symmetry very well.

Even when working with a symmetrical scene you can incorporate the rule within for elements such as people or key figures but in this situation it is down to the creator to figure what they feel is best in any given shot.

## How to Use Rule of Thirds in Filmora

The tools provided within Filmora are generous and one great feature is the crop and size tool.

When inserting an image or movie file you can right click on the timeline and select crop and size bringing up a handy screen with the gridlines already there for you. It's just a matter of aligning your shot for the best composition.

For reference I will show you what this looks like.

First right click the timeline on the image you want to reposition. Alternatively you can select the desired insert and press Alt+C this will also bring up the same editing box.

![crop rule of thirds video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/crop-rule-of-thirds-video.jpg)

Now click on the crop and zoom option and this editor will appear.

![crop rule of thirds filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/crop-rule-of-thirds-filmora.jpg)

As you can see you are able to align the shot and change the aspect ratio to align with your project. For a better look at the built in grid lines see image below.

![rule of thirds final video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/rule-of-thirds-final-video.jpg)

## Conclusion

To conclude, the rule of thirds is very important within visual media and is tough within the fundamentals of art and photography from beginner level right up to the highest point of education, Practice thinking about your placement of key elements within your videos and how this affects your overall composition. The goal is to have this as an automatic thought when shooting your videos or still images. This is a small change you can make but has a big impact on how a viewer engages your content and in return leaves a positive opinion towards your creativity and eye for detail.

## How Do You Find a High-Quality Video Marketing Company?

It is difficult to spot a high-quality agency because most promise a lot but deliver very little. With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.

##### Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective

Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.

![be clear about your objective](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_1.jpeg)

##### Step 2 Assess Overall Quality

On your journey of finding video marketing companies, you will come across many agencies that will look very promising, apparently. But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.

![assess overall quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_2.jpg)

##### Step 3 Give Priority to Experience

Selecting a marketing video agency without past experience with companies in your industry will be a blunder. This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.

![give priority to experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_3.jpg)

##### Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials

Checking out the reviews of past clients and customers is an essential part of selection. Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.

![check customer testimonials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_4.jpg)

##### Step 5 Watch out for Creativity

Creativity differentiates between excellence and average in the video marketing world. Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.

Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency's creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.

![watch out for creativity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_5.jpg)

##### Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously

Creative video content is useless if it cannot reach the most targeted audiences. The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a **marketing video agency** near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.

Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.

![take optimization seriously](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_6.jpeg)

##### Step 7 Dive Into the Process

You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.

Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.

![dive into the process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_7.jpeg)

##### Step 8 Focus on Communication

Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the **video marketing company**. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.

Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.

![focus on communication](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_8.jpg)

##### Step 9 Request a Proposal

You must have shortlisted a few high-quality video marketing companies following the steps mentioned so far. It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.

You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.

![request a proposal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_9.jpg)

##### Step 10 Evaluate Return on Investment

Last but not least, you should compare the prices to evaluate which proposals offer more value for your money. You should also calculate your return on investment so that your investment brings in the expected results without damaging you monetarily. You will also get to know the hidden charges and deliveries, and you should consider an agency that mentions them upfront for transparency. Finally, trust your assessment and instinct and select the best promotional video production company to take your business to the next level.

Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.

##### Step 2 Assess Overall Quality

On your journey of finding video marketing companies, you will come across many agencies that will look very promising, apparently. But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.

##### Step 3 Give Priority to Experience

Selecting a marketing video agency without past experience with companies in your industry will be a blunder. This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.

##### Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials

Checking out the reviews of past clients and customers is an essential part of selection. Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.

##### Step 5 Watch out for Creativity

Creativity differentiates between excellence and average in the video marketing world. Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.

Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency's creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.

![watch out for creativity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_5.jpg)

##### Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously

Creative video content is useless if it cannot reach the most targeted audiences. The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a **marketing video agency** near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.

Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.

![take optimization seriously](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_6.jpeg)

##### Step 7 Dive Into the Process

You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.

Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.

![dive into the process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_7.jpeg)

##### Step 8 Focus on Communication

Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the **video marketing company**. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.

Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.

![focus on communication](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_8.jpg)

##### Step 9 Request a Proposal

You must have shortlisted a few high-quality video marketing companies following the steps mentioned so far. It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.

You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.

![request a proposal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_9.jpg)

##### Step 10 Evaluate Return on Investment

Last but not least, you should compare the prices to evaluate which proposals offer more value for your money. You should also calculate your return on investment so that your investment brings in the expected results without damaging you monetarily. You will also get to know the hidden charges and deliveries, and you should consider an agency that mentions them upfront for transparency. Finally, trust your assessment and instinct and select the best promotional video production company to take your business to the next level.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

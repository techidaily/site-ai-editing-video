The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

## **2 Ways to Edit FlV Video on iPhone:**

### **1\.** **LumaFusion:**

No other software program on the iPhone comes close to the feature set that LumaFusion offers for video editing. It is the only premium app on this list, and it is well worth every penny.

But, of course, YouTubers aren't the only ones who use the program; mobile journalists and professional video producers who don't want to lug along their bulky camera equipment and editing apparatus also use it.

LumaFusion deals with up to six video and audio tracks for photographs, movies, audio, titles, and graphics, and six audio tracks for narration, music, and sound effects. You also receive a magnetic timeline; importing clips is a breeze once they've been imported.

There are many transitions and effects to choose from, all of which can be layered. Finally, it includes much royalty-free music, sound effects, and other assets. So if you need a professional video editing tool for your iPhone, LumaFusion ($29.99) is the way to go.

Follow these steps to edit FLV video using LumaFusion:

Step 1: To create your first project, press + at the bottom of the screen. You can create a new project by tapping that area or by tapping the Plus button.

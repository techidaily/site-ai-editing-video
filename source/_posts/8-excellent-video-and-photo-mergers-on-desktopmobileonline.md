## How to Create Video in Text Intro?

Have you ever seen videos on social media apps or movies and seen a video in text like the title as the intro? The highly appealing and unique style makes the video introduction stand out. Not to mention, it creates an illusion of almost-transparent titles that showcase the video playing in a subdued manner in the background, thereby showcasing a modern, funky intro.

![the example of text intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-0.gif)

Now, are you planning to create an effect such as that on your own video project? Worry not; you do not have to hire video editing experts at enormous costs or opt for a video editing course, to name a few. With [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can create the effect at more than half the cost and effort. Let's learn how that works.

## 1\. Accessing the software

The first step to kickstart the whole process is downloading the software into your system. For this, visit the official website of Filmora and click on the Download button at the top of the page or the description. This will automatically download an installer for the app on your device.

![click on the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-1.jpg)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

From the Downloads section of your Mac or Windows-based device in the browser, double-click on the installer. It will ask you to confirm the terms and conditions and press the Install button on the next pop-up prompt. Then will start the overall downloading process of the software into your device, and it will take some seconds, after which Filmora will automatically open to the homepage.

Click on the "Create New Project" button on the homepage, and that will launch the software to the editor window.

![launch to the editor window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-2.jpg)

## 2\. Add Sample Color

On the main editor window of Filmora, you have to go to the My Media section. From the drop-down list, click on the folder full of Sample Colors. Next, click on the black sample color option and drag it down to the editing timeline. Finally, drop it in the place of the Track 1 section on the timeline.

![drop it in track 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-3.jpg)

## 3\. Put the Title tile into the video

After you add the sample color to the timeline, you have to click on the Titles tab from the top main toolbar of Filmora. Out of the options you find here, choose the Default Title. Then, hold it and drag the title template onto the Track 2 section of the editing timeline, and drop it in place.

Then, double-click on it to open the editing panel for the text. You will see a text field where you can update the title wording instead of "Your Title Here". Then, you have to change the size of this title text to 280\. Make sure to adjust the font style to whichever option you prefer, but typically a blocky style works. Click on the Bold icon to change the structure of the title text.

Scroll downward among the text editing parameters until you see the Text Spacing option. Whatever the default value here is placed as, you have to turn it to 10\. After that, click on the OK button.

![change the title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-4.jpg)

## 4\. Take a Snapshot

After adjusting the size and dimension of the title you added, click on the Snapshot icon to take a screenshot of the Track 2 title clip that has been changed. Then, select both of the clips on Tracks 1 and 2 and remove them from the timeline.

## 5\. Insert the background video

Next, go to the My Media tab again and choose the Project Media option. Right-click on the library section and tap on the Import button. This will open you to the device storage of your computer. From there, please search for the video clip you want to insert into your project as the main video background and import it into Filmora.

![search for the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-5.jpg)

Then, when that is available in your media library section, hold it and drag and drop the clip onto the timeline in the Track 1 section.

## 6\. Add the Black and White Effect

Move the playhead forward to the 15-second mark on the added clip in the timeline. Then, tap on the scissor icon to split this clip. Please tap on the excess amount of the video clip and delete it.

Following that, click on the Effects tab on the top toolbar of Filmora. Out of the list of various effects that you will find, tap on the Black and White category and choose the Willow effect. If you cannot find the Willow effect easily, you can directly search for it in the text search field above and select from there.

Then, drag the willow effect to the video clip in the timeline below, keeping a watch on the preview window. The effect will turn the video into its format of Black and White.

![drag the willow effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-6.jpg)

## 7\. Add the Screenshot to the Edit

Again, scroll up to the My Media section and tap on the screenshot you created earlier. Then, drag it down onto Track 2 of the editing timeline. Then, use the playback to mark the beginning of the video two frames off of the beginning of the video. Then, move the clip to that position so that it starts from that point onward.

Next, move the playback to the 14-second mark and adjust the Track 3 clip to fit that section perfectly.

![move the playback to 14 second mark](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-7.jpg)

## 8\. Use the Chroma Key Effect

![choose the black color from preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-8.jpg)

You must now click on the Crop option from the function bar. On the top, you will get the option for Pan and Zoom. Click on it and shorten the visible bright window by dragging it towards the center.

Move the playhead ahead in the timestamp and again click on the Chroma Key button from the function bar. When it opens, click on the Chroma key option in the editor and change the edge thickness value to a -7 number.

## 9\. Export the Clip

Once done, you need to export this clip. To do so, tap on the Export button at the top of the screen. On the Export page, change the name of the video to the intro title text and go to Settings to see its resolution condition.

![click on the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-9.jpg)

## 10\. Add the Effect on the Video Clip

Double-click on the background video clip on the timeline to open the text editor window. Tap on the Effects tab in this section and remove the Willow effect from your video.

You must extend the video duration to 20 seconds in the lowermost editing window. After that, import the exported video clip from where you stored it after downloading.

Then, drag and drop the file back into the timeline. Here, the next step for you is to adjust the playhead position for the new video clip. Move the play head to the 14th second and the 14th frame position to synchronize it with the Track 3 video clip.

Then, double-click on the video, and under the video tab, choose the Chroma Key option. Then, tap on the color picker and choose to add white color from the preview window. After this, select the Edge Thickness parameter on the editor window and increase it to a value of 1.5.

![select the edge thickness parameter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-11.jpg)

## Tips for Choosing Location & Scheduling Music Video

Making viral music videos is everyone's dream; what if you get exact tips to follow before shooting your music video to make it high-ranked? Obviously, it'll be a treat for you!

Planning and preparing before the shoot is the key to making a music video successful. You can only achieve this after location scouting and emerging with the best one. And scheduling for big projects before the day is more important. Let's directly move towards the things to consider before shooting!

## Location scouting

The pleasant and eye-catchy location always makes your music video trending or flopping. You should first go with your budget and then come up with location ideas. In the upcoming tip, we will use 3lau's song "Tokyo" as an example.

![finding the right location for the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/finding-the-right-location-for-the-music-video.jpg)

If you are going with large projects, you need to consider the following requirements!

### 1\. Availability of electricity

You need rig lights and a large lighting setup to make your video more glow and give them aesthetic vibes. For this, make sure you choose a location where light is readily available.

### 2\. Separate room

During shooting for big projects, you need room to store all gear and sensitive equipment in one place for many days.

![separate room to store gears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/separate-room-to-store-gears.jpg)

### 3\. Check the size

The foremost thing in choosing the location is to check the Height and Width of the studio. They should be enough to rig the lights in the studio easily and place every required thing in a decided space.

For Example, while shooting a 3lau song, there is a need for a bus to come into the studio easily, but there is an issue in entering the bus due to height issues of the door. Due to this, the director changed the location at the spot to sort out this issue.

![check the size of the studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/check-the-size-of-the-studio.jpg)

## Alternate Ways of Location Scouting

If you don't have enough budget to get a studio space, then you can easily shoot by selecting spaces that are in your use or available. These are the following locations you should regard!

### Location 1\. Your Home

You should go with the space available at your home to shoot, such as: on couches or in the bedroom, to give a good impression to your music video.

### Location 2\. Office Space

You can also make scenes of your music video in office space to better describe the work in the video.

![office space for shooting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/office-space-for-shooting.jpg)

### Location 3\. Outdoor Locations

For better daylight and illustrations in the music video, you can go with the outdoor location, which is free of cost.

![outdoor location for shooting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/outdoor-location-for-shooting.jpg)

### Location 4\. Public Places

Public places are easily available and have many options, such as public parks, playgrounds, bridges, and public parking.

![public places for music videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/public-places-for-music-videos.jpg)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** During public shooting, ensure that the space is empty, and there should be no interruption of the public in filming the shots.

![public interruption in shots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/public-interruption-in-shots.jpg)

The weather is also a major factor when shooting a video, which you must check before the shoot days. After selecting and scouting the location, now it's time to make a schedule which you'll get in hand in the below lines!

## Scheduling for the Music Video

If you have a big project and more scenes to shoot, it's better to make a whole plan about each and everything. You have to make a schedule of using even a single light at a specific time and space. The following are the main considerations you should take care of!

### 1\. Pre-Rig Day

You need to come to the setup before the filming day to check the main things like electricity, measure exact spaces, check the lightning setup, loaded everything such as the bus, crew, and gears.

![loaded and checked everything on the pre rig day](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/loaded-and-checked-everything-on-the-pre-rig-day.jpg)

### 2\. A Call Sheet

A call sheet is a daily shot list given to the cast and crew to follow the timelines, and it contains the phone number of everyone, their location, and the time to arrive on set. It also includes the nearest hospital, sunset, and sun-rising timing.

![call sheet of tokyo song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/call-sheet-of-tokyo-song.jpg)

It consists of one to two pages according to shoot days and has a plan of everything that happens after the Pre-Rig day.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** When you wrap up for day 1, you have another call sheet for day 2, day 3, and so on!

### 3\. Do Planning

You need to work efficiently and smartly to maintain everything according to the plan. You can cut the filming into halves to have a better lighting setup and character availability. On the shot day, you must change the lighting and rigging setup as little as possible.

**Examples**

On day 1 of the Tokyo song, the filming is done in two halves; the first half day goes towards filming everything in the bus, and the other half day, there is a shoot of everything outside the bus.

While in day 2, there is a filming of every memory. For this, there are setups of rooms and homes for making perfect shots according to the requirements of a music video.

![day 2 of filming tokyo song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/day-2-of-filming-tokyo-song.gif)

### 4\. Take No Stress

You should not blow up and take stress during shoot day because it'll obviously cause chaos in every little scene and give a bad impression to the music video. You just should work hard and get all done.

## Conclusion

After checking and following the above tips for location scouting and scheduling, you'll obviously come up with an amazing filming setup and music video. There is no need to worry, just get the whole planning and then do all scenes one after the other patiently.

Filming with people is not always bulky and flopping, but if you have a cooperative team and follow all the timelines of shooting. Then you'll rock the music video!

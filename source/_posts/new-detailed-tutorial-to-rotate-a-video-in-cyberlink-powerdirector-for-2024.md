## Detailed Tutorial to Rotate a Video in Cyberlink PowerDirector

Video Editing is a craft that is highly dependent on various characteristics of your video. But the way one presents it or goes about filming clips also has a profound effect on the end product. And as you may know, not every aspect of a video production activity always goes without hiccups. But editing can come in clutch as it can easily solve minor problems like skewed footage that was shot at the wrong angle or is upside down (an issue that can happen while using mobile phones).

Thus, with this article, we will be looking at steps to rotate a video in Cyberlink PowerDirector to help you when required. We have also mentioned the steps you will need to follow in Wondershare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X._

## Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector

Put yourself in a situation where you've just finished filming a project with your smartphone but end up realizing that the footage isn't in the right orientation by default. While the error has an easy fix on most smartphones, you can also perform this action with video editing tools.

Also, while this form of rotating might be the most basic implementation of the feature, you can often use the feature to add a dynamic nature to your video with Keyframes.

**Definition:** Keyframes in Video Editing is a software feature that allows an editor to set start and endpoints (denoted by In and Out Markers), presenting the opportunity to custom clip properties between the two positions. The set changes occur gradually as the playhead continues moving through the clip. Properties that can undergo modification with this method are zoom, rotation, colors, positions, etc.

The process of rotating clips is fairly straightforward; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.

_If you do not have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting_ [_Cyberlink's official website_](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)_._

**Step 1:** Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 and choose Full Mode.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-1.jpeg)

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.

**Step 2:** Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.

For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**EXTRA**

Rotation added in the PiP Designer will function as a keyframe-based rotation action. Right-click on the video in the preview window, choose Edit and then Modify to access this menu.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

Following this, you can click on the Motion Tab, go into Rotation Settings, and modify the angle with greater precision. In the Preview Window, you will now be able to see the rotating video.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-5.jpeg)

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**

Though Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 is a powerful video editing tool, we felt its menus were not as simple to navigate. Accessing the rotate function while available in the forefront, the use of PiP Designer didn't feel intuitive.

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , rotating footage only happens via the Edit Option, and this straightforward approach felt simple. As for those who want to use Keyframes, the integration of this feature right above the Timeline is an appreciated convenience.

This emphasis on quick accessibility is present with almost every function in Filmora, and we believe this to be a significant advantage. The use of modern and unique iconography also increases familiarity, an aspect that will always be welcoming to new and budding creators.

_If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

To help you learn how to use the rotate function and show you an example of the easy accessibility in Filmora, here is how you can use the feature to get the output you desire.

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Once you have a new project open in Filmora, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a Media File to edit into your Video Project.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-6.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video clip onto the Timeline and then select it with a mouse click to activate further interactions.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-7.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the Edit Option (marked in Red).

This will bring up the Edit Window in the left-top corner of your screen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-8.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Click on the Transform Menu and use the Rotation Slider to edit the orientation.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-9.jpeg)

Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.

**BONUS**

Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-10.jpeg)

## The Bottom Line

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn't always the most accurate.

And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.

High features of AI software should include speech and voice recognition, machine learning, virtual assistants, etc. In addition, AI software combined with machine learning can provide various users with the required functionality to simplify the business process.

![deep learning of ai video recognition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/deep-learning-of-ai-video-recognition-1.jpeg)

AI software can develop and build an intelligent application from the beginning with the help of deep learning capabilities and Machine learning. In addition, **video recognition AI is the machine’s capacity to analyze, obtain, and process information that it receives from a visual source, specifically video. The video recognition systems help computers comprehend the information received in the large volumes of video feeds, frame by frame.**

02 [Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?](#Part 2)

03 [Understanding 6 Top Video Recognition Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?**

**AI Video Recognition** is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.

In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.

Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.

Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways **AI video recognition** works:

**●** Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video

**●** Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video

**●** Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video

**●** Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest

**●** Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.

![what is ai video recognition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/deep-learning-of-ai-video-recognition-2.jpg)

## Part 2 **Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?**

**Video recognition AI** primarily focuses on comprehending the information or data received from many video feeds, frame by frame. It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.

Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual's face's digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.

![ai video recognition and facial recognition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/deep-learning-of-ai-video-recognition-3.png)

## Part 3 **Understanding 6 Top Video Recognition Software**

## Part 1 **What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?**

**AI Video Recognition** is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.

In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.

Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.

Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways **AI video recognition** works:

**●** Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video

**●** Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video

**●** Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video

**●** Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest

**●** Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.

![what is ai video recognition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/deep-learning-of-ai-video-recognition-2.jpg)

## Part 2 **Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?**

**Video recognition AI** primarily focuses on comprehending the information or data received from many video feeds, frame by frame. It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.

Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual's face's digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.

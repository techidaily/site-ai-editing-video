## If You're Considering Starting a Podcast Video Recording, You Need to Read This Article and Learn All You Need to Know About Making a Successful Podcast

Starting a video podcast can be quite intimidating, but the truth is; having the proper knowledge will help you do things more correctly.

As we all know, knowledge is the key to success. So, for you to navigate your way around the video podcasting industry easily, you need to consume enough information that will enable you to make fewer wrong decisions.

To help you out, we took our time to do more research on how to record video podcasts, and in this post, we will share all you need to know to record a video podcast that stands out.

## Part 1\. But first: why record with a video?

If you've done a little research, you'll notice many podcasters switched to recording with videos instead of audio. Did they decide to start doing that so we could see their faces? Well, the answer is NO. But before we discuss more on that, you should know what a video podcast is and its types.

You guessed right. A video podcast is a podcast with video. The video element could be a static image or a video recording of the podcast host and the guest. A video podcast will help you do the following;

**1\. Enhance the visual content**

Research shows that humans learn more from what they visualize than what is heard. Yes, this is because 30% of the human brain comprises neurons dedicated to visual processing, and just 3% is dedicated to hearing. Besides, videos are always more engaging compared to audio. So why not combine both to boost your podcast performance?

**2\. Level up the personality and relatability**

Most people have more belief in what they see than what is heard. So, video podcasts allow audiences to easily see your expression and understand your passion for the subject you discuss. It also builds a deeper level of connections between you and them. Also, it helps to add to the originality of your podcast and your brand as a whole.

**3\. Make the content more accessible**

Your podcast show becomes more accessible when it's in the video. You won't be limited to just uploading it on podcast platforms but also on social media as a short TikTok trailer, Instagram post, YouTube video, etc. Doing this will get your content in front of a wide range of audience, thus prompting more people to engage with your podcast.

## Part 2\. Get your gear set up

The first step to starting a video podcast is getting your gear set up. We recommend you start with the following podcast equipment:

* A camera (if recording a video podcast)
* Microphone(s)
* Headphone(s)
* Memory cards
* Tripods
* Computers
* Recording software or a digital audio workstation

Let's dig deeper into each of these. We've compiled the best podcast equipment for beginners and pros alike based on our extensive research.

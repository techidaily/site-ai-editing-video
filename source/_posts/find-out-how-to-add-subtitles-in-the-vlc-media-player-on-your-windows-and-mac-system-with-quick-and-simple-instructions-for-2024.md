Once you know how QuickTime Player makes it easy for Mac users to play their video, it is time to understand the steps associated with the procedure. Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:

Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.

![select quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-1.jpg)

If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.

Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.

## Part 4: How to Do Screen Recording with QuickTime?

Several functions can be performed across QuickTime. While the QuickTime video format allows you to play different videos across the platform, it also helps users record screens of their choice.

## Part 5: How to Convert Video File to MOV Format in QuickTime?

QuickTime Player is not quite extensive when it comes to converting video files.

![choose video quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-10.jpg)

Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.

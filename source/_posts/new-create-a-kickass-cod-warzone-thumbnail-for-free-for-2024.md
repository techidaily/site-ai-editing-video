Let us help you with that. Here are 5 Call of Duty: Warzone thumbnails you should check out.

It is cool and sure to attract the attention of the COD: Warzone demographics.

### 2\. TOP 300 FUNNIEST FAILS IN WARZONE

![warzone thumbnail by red arcade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-2.JPG)

This video is made by [Red Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1UFojIiiK8). It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can't say that the thumbnail did not help. It's actually really good.

The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player's character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words "AFK. Don't shoot!" are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It's more "funny" than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.

### 3\. Clean House \[PS5 UHD 4K\] Next-Gen Ultra Realistic Graphics PlayStation 5 Call of Duty Gameplay

![warzone thumbnail by hedgehog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-3.JPG)

The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you're also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.

![warzone thumbnail by gtx 1050 ti](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-4.JPG)

The thumbnail for this video (made by [GTX 1050 Ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9zMSBcius)), with 5.2 million views, is just an in-game screenshot. At the top-right is a large logo of GEFORCE RTX 3080 and at the bottom left is an Intel logo. Like the previous one, it attracts viewers by stating the visual appeal of the video.

### 5\. NEW RECORD! 64 KILL GAME in CoD WARZONE! (Best Classes / Loadouts)

Players are attracted to amazing gameplay. Unsurprisingly, the player who got 64 kills got 3.1 million views in his video. The gist is that if you have achieved something amazing, try to incorporate it into the thumbnail.

## Part 1: How to Slow Down Videos in YouTube?

If you watch YouTube videos often, you must have been aware of the **YouTube slow-down** feature. The playback adjustment option on YouTube helps with that. By enabling that option, the whole YouTube video slows down. For adding slow-motion effects at specific durations, you can use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). In this part, we’ll explore both methods of slowing down a YouTube video:

* [Method 1\. Direct Method](#method1)
* [Method 2\. Using Wondershare Filmora](#method2)

### Method 1\. Direct Method

If you have the YouTube application, you can commence this action straight. If not, you can also open YouTube on your browser. Given below are the steps to **play YouTube in slow motion**:

##### Step 1

Once you play a YouTube video, navigate towards the bottom of this video. Afterward, click on the "Settings" option and select the "Playback speed" option.

![access playback speed settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-1.jpg)

##### Step 2

From the expansion menu, select a playback speed option as per preferences. You can select a speed between 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25\. Afterward, play your video and see if the speed is right. This is the simplest method for **YouTube video slow motion**.

#### Step 1Downloading a YouTube Video

YouTube doesn't allow users to download a YouTube video on their devices. Hence, you will need third-party support to do so. Many sites offer YouTube video download services. We are using the [y2mate.com](https://www.y2mate.com/en870), and here are the steps for it:

**1\. Copy the YouTube Video Link**

First, access the respective video that you want to download from YouTube. Locate the "Share" option at the bottom of this video and select it. Then click the "Copy" option to copy your video's link.

![copy link of youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-3.jpg)

**2\. Access the Site**

After copying the video's link, access the site using your web browser. In the "Search or paste link here" box, paste the video link and click "Start." From the download options appearing at the bottom, select a suitable option. Click on the "Download" button adjacent to your option.

![open and download youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-4.jpg)

#### Step 2Slow Down YouTube Video in Filmora

Once you have downloaded the video on your device, it is time to **slow down the YouTube video**. Filmora offers a plain and simple method to slow down a video. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you create video slow-mo in Filmora:

**1\. Import the YouTube Video**

Since Wondershare Filmora is a desktop tool, you must download it first. Initiate it and click the "New Project" option to reach its editing interface. Click on the "Import" option to import the video you downloaded. Afterward, bring this video to the timeline using the drag-and-drop technique.

![import video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-5.jpg)

**2\. Access Uniform Speed**

Select the video in the timeline and direct it toward the settings panel appearing on the right side. From the given tabs, go to the “Speed” tab and select “Uniform Speed.” Further, adjust the “Speed” slider or its value in the given box. This will slow down your video, and you can preview it to adjust further.

![access speed settings and change](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-6.jpg)

#### Step 3Smoothing Out the YouTube Slow-Mo

Upon previewing the YouTube slo-mo, you might notice some roughness in it. For creating a smooth slow-mo, use the Optical Flow option. Here are the steps to enable this option in Filmora:

**1\. Enable the Optical Flow Option**

Navigate toward the "AI Frame Interpolation" section. You can find it at the bottom of the Uniform Speed tab. Afterward, expand this section and select the "Optical Flow" option.

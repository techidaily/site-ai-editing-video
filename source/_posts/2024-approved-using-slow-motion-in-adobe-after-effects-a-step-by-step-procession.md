Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

## Part 1: Why Should You Look Forward to Zoom Your YouTube Video?

There can be various causes to **zoom** **in** **on** **YouTube** videos as users can clearly see hidden information and details from the video through it. For instance, if you are reviewing a trailer of a particular movie on your YouTube channel, you would be required to **zoom in YouTube** video many times. For breaking down the trailer, you would need to focus on the backgrounds, props, and other hidden details that are only possible through zooming in and out of the videos.

Moreover, if you are watching a demonstration of the chemistry practical on YouTube videos, readings on the apparatus may not be apparent in it. So here, you can also read and notice precise complicated readings on the videos by just zooming in. Also, in other scenarios, you can read the product's description in makeup tutorials by using the option of zooming in and out.

To sum up, every regular user of YouTube must know how to zoom in on YouTube videos so that he can quickly focus on the details with a single click. By knowing the methods of zooming in and out, you can comprehensively extract the information through YouTube videos that can make your daily tasks easier.

## Part 2: Effective Methods on How to Zoom in and Out YouTube Videos Easily

In this section, we will provide three effective methods to **zoom** **in** **YouTube** videos effortlessly. By applying any of the following methods, you can easily focus on the small details.

### Method 1: Zoom In and Out on the YouTube Video Player

Are you looking for easier ways to zoom in and out of the YouTube video? YouTube gives the option on its player for viewing the videos in two modes: Theatre mode and full mode. Through theater mode, you can watch your video in a comparatively zoomed manner, whereas, in full screen, you can watch the video on a full screen of the monitor.

In this particular method, we will provide simple and easy steps for zooming in on the YouTube video player:

**Step 1:** Navigate to the YouTube app on your device browser, such as Google Chrome. On its search box, enter the video you want to watch.

![search for youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Press Enter, and you will see various options related to your desired video. Click on any particular video to watch.

**Step 3:** On the YouTube video player, you would be able to see two screen mode options on the right side. The first option is "Full Screen" mode, through which you can enjoy watching your videos on a full monitor screen. The second option is "Theatre Mode," which will display the video in a cinematic look by zooming in to some extent. Explore these options to observe the small details in your YouTube video closely.

### Method 2: Zoom In and Out with Browser Zoom Features

To **zoom** **in** **on** **YouTube** **videos**, your browser also offers effective ways for the users. By using the browser zoom features, you can quickly zoom in and out of the video without the need for additional help. Moreover, these zoom features are also beneficial for reading eBooks or online documents.

Here are the three ways through which you can instantly zoom in on your favorite YouTube videos easily:

**Way 1:** The first way to zoom in on video is through browser options. To do so, tap on the “Three-Dot” icon of your browser displayed in the top right corner. From the menu, tap on “Zoom” and control the actions through its small menu.

### Method 3: Zoom In on YouTube Video with Browser Extension

In this section, we will use a browser extension that will assist you in zooming in and out on YouTube videos comfortably. We will recommend the [Zoom browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoom-for-google-chrome/lajondecmobodlejlcjllhojikagldgd) due to its distinct properties and features. Through its slider, you can zoom in on the YouTube video up to 400 factors with a single swipe.

Moreover, through this special browser extension, you can save the zoomed version of the website and can resume watching the videos from the set zoom value. To save your time, this browser also gives the option to zoom in and out the web pages together with a single click. To use this browser extension to **zoom** **in** **on** **Youtube**, here are simple steps.

**Step 1:** Install the Zoom browser extension on your device from the Chrome Store by tapping on the “Add to Chrome” button to download and install the extension.

Whether you've been video marketing for years or are just starting out, coming up with catchy video titles might be the most difficult aspect of the process. The title of a video has a significant role in whether or not viewers choose to click the play button, making it more than simply a minor feature. Poor titles make it difficult to attract views and expand your following, regardless of how fantastic your videos are. Here are the best scrutinized tips for creating best ranking titles for your videos:

**1\. Optimize the title using keywords for improved SEO**

It might be difficult to come up with a title that is original, concise, and descriptive. However, a strong video title stays something original. Keywords are crucial for more than simply your website. They are important for video titles, too. If you want people to see your videos when they search for certain phrases, those keywords should be in the title because Google and YouTube can't watch videos and grasp the content (yet).

**2\. Perfectly Match the Content**

A excellent video title explains to viewers what to anticipate from the video. It's unambiguous, straightforward, and sincere. Additionally, if you are familiar with your target demographic, you will be able to generate a lot more hits to your videos.

Try answering the questions on your own to get a catchy video title. People are more inclined to watch a video if you make reference to a secret or exceptional knowledge that you will disclose in it. Keep in mind that your goal is not to deceive viewers into viewing your video.

**4\. Increase the Click Through Rate**

The finest titles are those that best expose the vulnerabilities of the reader. Consider it a little preview for your video. If you are creating a how-to or instructive video that answers a question or gives information, you may want to consider include the question in the title. It also makes it simple to think up video concept.

**5\. Attempt to utilize cue (triggering) words**

Your title and description should both include your target keyword. You'll probably start to generate some ideas for a real video title after you begin your keyword research.

As for the knowledge gap, consider how your target audience would respond.

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.

## Have the Desire to Create a Stylish Glitch Effect to a Text on Your Video? Use Filmora for the Editing, Following the Given Steps Explained in Detail

Have you noticed the glitching effect that appears when you play a video or in games, creating a sporadic shaky effect on video edges? While this usually signifies a systematic software issue in these cases, the effect itself can work to create a dynamic visual style for different objects when done intentionally.

In fact, many video editors today use the glitch effect on elements in their videos, like the introductory title in movies or trailers. It creates a futuristic look to the text, which highly appeals to viewers who engage more in the video itself.

Suppose you are looking to add a similar effect to the title of your video project or other text-based content that you will add to your video, use a good tool for that. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), in particular, makes adding this effect very simple. Let's learn how.

## 1\. Launch the Filmora software

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The first step in preparing a customized glitch text effect is getting your software ready.

Visit the official website of Wondershare Filmora and tap on the Download button at the top to get the free software. The features necessary to create this effect are available under the free version, so you can avoid the plan upgradation process at this point.

After clicking the free download icon, the software's installer version will save into your device automatically. Double-click on and agree with the related Terms and Conditions prompt. Then, tap on the Install button, and the software will take a few seconds to complete the installation process fully.

After that, click on the Start Now button to launch the software on your Mac or Windows computer that you are using. Filmora will open on its homepage.

## 2\. Add the default title to timeline

Next, click the Create New Project button on the main page to access the editor section. Then, you have to click on the Titles tab and choose the Default Title option from the menu.

Drag it down from the media library section to the timeline and drop it in the Track 2 row. After that, move the play head with your cursor to the 1-second and the 10th frame on the timeline. Then, hold and move this clip until the end part of the clip is at this mark.

![move to playhead](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-2.jpg)

## 3\. Adjust the font of the title

Next, double-click on this clip on the editor timeline to open the text editing window. Here, under the Preset section, change the title font to what to want to first word of your title to be.

Change the font style to a bigger bold option like Impact and increase the font size to 100\. Then, scroll a little downward and tap on the Text Spacing option. Increase this value by 5 and press the OK button when you are done.

![tap on the text spacing button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-3.jpg)

## 4\. Add and copy all of the word clips

After adjusting the text font, tap on this clip on the timeline and copy it. Then, paste it just after the first clip ends, reducing its duration to around 1 second.

Then, double-click on the copied clip to open the text editing window. Click on the section where you can add the text and change it to the second word of your title. Again, copy this clip and paste it next to it, adjust it to be one second long, double-click on it to adjust the text to read the third word, and so on.

![change text to second word](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-4.jpg)

Continue until all of your intro's words are added in these clip forms.

## 5\. Create and add the snapshots

Following the previous step, click on the My Media section. Then, tap on the first clip in the collection and tap on the Snapshot icon at the end of the editing toolbar right above the timeline. Repeat this step for all the clips you have added until a snapshot of each of the words is stored in the media library.

Next, you have to grab hold of the first snapshot that you click and move it to the Track 1 of the timeline. Use the cursor to hold it and reduce the size of the clip to the same amount as the first clip on Track 1\. To be sure, you can place the playhead at this point to see that the ending time for both clips is aligned.

![reduce snapshot clip size same as track 1 clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-5.jpg)

## 6\. Adjust the text effect for the first word

## 7\. Edit the snapshots for all words

After making changes to the first word, you must take hold of the second word's snapshot from the media library. Drag and then drop it onto Track 1 of the editing timeline right next to the first clip. Then, hold the edge of this clip and reduce its size to fit the same duration as the second clip adjacent to it on Track 2.

Following that, you must choose this clip on Track 1 and right-click on top of it. Click on the "Paste Effects" option from the next drop-down menu, and the same adjustments will apply to this clip.

![click on the paste effects option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-7.jpg)

Repeat this step with all of the next snapshots of the following words.

## 8\. Add the first effect layer

At this point, ensure the effect falls right above the first and second clip parts in the track below. Tap on the edges of this clip to reduce the size of the video effect, taking careful note to keep the clip 8 frames long overall.

Then, copy the cut-down effect from Track 3 and paste it at every intersectional point between the separated word-based clips in Track 2.

Following this, you must zoom into the timeline for a better view and editing control for the next part.

Go to the Effects tab at the top and choose the Filters collection next. Under it, choose the Chaos 1 effect option, drag it down to the timeline, and place it above the previous clip on Track 4\. Adjust the starting edge of this clip to have the same starting point as the Video\_seg effect on Track 3 with an overall 8-frame duration.

![adjust the edges of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-10.jpg)

## 10\. Edit the Effect

Then, drag and drop it on Track 5 of the timeline right above the previous effect and reduce its duration to the same level as the first two effects. Copy it and then paste the clip again for each clip-to-clip intersection.

After this part, drag the Glitch Dispersion effect down to the timeline. Place it above the previous effect and adjust the clip's size to the same length. Again, copy the effect and repeat the steps again. Next, repeat the same whole process with the Negative Flicker effect from the Flicker collection on Track 7.

You can also increase the vibrancy and hue saturation curves for more enhancement. You can also navigate to the basic correction section to modify the contrast value accordingly.

### 2\. Transition

To merge multiple video clips smoothly and efficiently, transitional effects can assist you. By adding a suitable transition effect, you can make your whole video look clean and cinematic.

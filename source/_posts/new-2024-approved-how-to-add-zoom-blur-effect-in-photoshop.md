##### Step 5 Use the masking tool

Make more cuts on the top latter clip, frame by frame, starting from the first cut you have made.

![make more cuts on the top latter clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-7.gif)

![double-click on each of the smaller clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-8.jpg)

Since the subject in this tutorial is moving from side to side, we are going to match the mask's y-axis setting, which is also the revealed text portion, with the subject's movement. Starting from the first clip, adjust the y-axis number to a smaller/bigger number.

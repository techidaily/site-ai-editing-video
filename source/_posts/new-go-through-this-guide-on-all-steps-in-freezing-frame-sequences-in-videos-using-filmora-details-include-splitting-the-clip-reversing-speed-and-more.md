## Go Through This Guide on All Steps in Freezing Frame Sequences in Videos Using Filmora. Details Include Splitting the Clip, Reversing Speed, and More

One can add different effects to videos to create a more appealing movie style. One of the most well-liked and widely used effects is the freeze frame effect, which creates a short frozen frame effect on clips.

You can use different video editing software to create this effect in videos. But not all of them come close to the easy-to-use functionality of [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). On a video, you can utilize this feature to freeze a specific reaction of the character on screen or add a dramatic effect for a pivotal moment, like scoring a touchdown.

Upon enabling this effect, the video clip automatically splits at the frozen moments. Users insert another image file for that duration and activate the background audio and effects. If you are wondering how to carry out this feature on Filmora, read all the steps involved here.

## Launching the Software

The first step is downloading the software on your computer, whether it is macOS-powered or Windows. Go to the software's official website and click on the blue Download button at the top of the home page.

You do not have to do a lot of steps to complete this process since an installer of the app will automatically download into your device at this step. Make sure you are downloading the Wondershare Filmora 11 version since it is the latest version of the software with advanced upgrades, like the Freeze Frame support.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

To install the software, you have to double-click on the app installer that got downloaded and agree to the permissions that it prompts. Then, the installation process will continue. The software will launch automatically after the process ends and you press Start Now.

![install the software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-1.gif)

## Adding the footage

Next, your main step is to add the video you will edit into the Filmora software. First, you must click the Create New Project tab on the homepage. When the editor opens, tap on the "Click here to import media" button and insert the video you will edit from your device. Next, drag it down to the editing timeline for making further changes. Choose the Keep project settings option when the prompt comes up to ensure the same quality of the video.

![insert the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-2.gif)

Still, it would help if you tapped the play button on the screen to see a Preview of the video clip to check its stability and quality. Also, ensure that your main subject is darker than the backdrop in the video clip.

## Adjust the playhead location

On the video clip, you added to the editing timeline, click on the playhead. Then, drag it to move it to the specific point in the video where you will freeze the frame. Click on the Snapshot icon at the right end of the preview window to capture the frame. Press the Lock Track icon after that.

![click the snapshot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-3.gif)

## Move the image in place

After the previously mentioned step, you should drag the snapshot you just captured to the second layer on the timeline above the clip. Make sure to place the image where the playhead is, marking the point of the freeze frame. Then, drag the slider at the end of the image clip you added to the timeline to match its length with the video clip.

Afterward, you should click on the playhead and move it a little ahead by a few frames. Again, tap the "Lock Track" icon beside the image file to keep it in place. Following that, take another snapshot of the image via the Snapshot icon.

![tap the lock track icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-4.gif)

## Unlock the layers

Repeat this step for a few more layers, like dragging the snapshot image to the timeline > moving the playhead by some frames > Snapshot > Lock Track. Then, after you are done with the number of stages possible with your video clip, unlock all of the locked track layers sequentially from top to bottom.

## Editing the layers

After this, click on the second clip in the layers. Right-click on the top of the clip in the timeline and choose "Edit Properties" from the drop-down menu. Next, click on the Compositing option and tap the tickmark beside it. Then, select the drop-down menu for the Blending Mode option and change Normal to Darken. Press the OK button after you are done.

![change normal to darken](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-5.gif)

Following that, repeat the same for all of the layers of the snapshots to choose the blending mode parameter for them to Darken. After you are done, click on the Preview play button to see how the process worked for creating the freeze frame effect in your video clip.

## Exporting the effect the first time

After completing all the editing steps, you should select the Export button at the top of the screen. Then, choose the Local tab and click on the MP4 as the video file format. Make settings-based changes if needed and press the Export button.

![press the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-6.gif)

After that, however, import the edited file to Filmora from your device again.

## Edit the freeze frame video clip

Choose all of the video clip sections you edited on Filmora from the timeline after adding the recently edited video clip to the editor. Then, drag this clip to the primary editing timeline layer on the timeline and drop it.

Then, drag the playhead on the clip to the frame at which the third freeze frame occurs. For this, you can play the Preview of the clip to verify. After placing the playhead at that exact moment, click on the Split icon from the toolbar above the editor timeline or the Scissor icon. Then, remove the second half of the clip.

![drag the playhead and split](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-7.gif)

## Create the freeze frame to reverse the speed effect

After this, right-click on the top of the remaining video clip on your timeline. From the drop-down menu that appears, tap on the Copy option. Then, paste the second half beside the first half on the same layer.

After that, right-click on the second copied clip and choose the Speed option > Click on Reverse. After that, play the Preview to see how the effect appears in your video. Finally, export the video from Filmora.

![play the preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-8.gif)

## Conclusion

## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.

Here's how to differentiate color grading from color correction:

| Differentiating Factor          | Color Grading ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Color Correction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

![color grading photography - saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-2.jpg)

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

### The essential tools for color grading include

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

#### ● Color Match

As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture's colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.

## Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo

These are the essential stages for color grading your images:

● Step 1:  
The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:  
Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.

## Tips For Color Grading Photography

The following best practices will enhance your color grading:

* About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.
* Remember that color grading doesn't fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.
* Shoot your images in RAW. Doing this guarantees more control over your pictures' colors.
* Always experiment with different looks until you get your precise effect. Lightroom is one of the best color grading apps to use.
* Exercise maximum caution when manipulating backgrounds. Don't do too much, especially when you're taking an indoor shot. That's because manipulating indoor backgrounds too much can mismatch the foreground and background, making your portrait look weird.

Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:

## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.

Here's how to differentiate color grading from color correction:

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

![color grading photography - saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-2.jpg)

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

### The essential tools for color grading include

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

#### ● Color Match

As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture's colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.

## Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo

These are the essential stages for color grading your images:

● Step 1:  
The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:  
Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.

## Tips For Color Grading Photography

The following best practices will enhance your color grading:

* About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.
* Remember that color grading doesn't fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.
* Shoot your images in RAW. Doing this guarantees more control over your pictures' colors.
* Always experiment with different looks until you get your precise effect. Lightroom is one of the best color grading apps to use.
* Exercise maximum caution when manipulating backgrounds. Don't do too much, especially when you're taking an indoor shot. That's because manipulating indoor backgrounds too much can mismatch the foreground and background, making your portrait look weird.

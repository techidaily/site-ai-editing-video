![silence detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step3.JPG)

You may change the threshold or sensitivity to make it work for you. The sensitivity level determines the size of the pause. Thus, a lower sensitivity level records longer pauses. You can fine-tune three crucial Filmora Silence Detection settings in this step.

First, you should adjust the volume threshold to fix a specific value for silence. This parameter tells the algorithm how loud you want it to be before it becomes annoying. By default, 25% is the volume threshold. It implies that the software will consider segments silent if their volume threshold value is less than 25%.

 Now, you should adjust the Minimum Duration option. It tells Filmora how long a period of quiet or low-volume sound should be. Just 0.5 seconds is the default minimum duration. In other words, for 0.5 seconds to be considered quiet, there must be no sound.

 You can also set the Softening Buffer value. This setting allows you to add a little delay before and after audible parts begin and finish. With 0.1s set as the default, the softening buffer starts to work. It implies that the beginning and end of the audible parts may each have their own 0.1-second buffering time.

The software also highlights segments in two different colors. Seen in black are the portions that do not contain any sound. The highlighted sections indicate the audible portions.

##### Step5Evaluate Your Work and Adjust

![evaluate your work and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step5.JPG)

You can make sure the video segments move without a hitch. Thus, listen to the modified audio track again. You can adjust the clips in the timeline to customize the edit directly if necessary.

Of course, you also have the option to tweak the three audio settings listed in step 3\. Next, choose Restart to remove the silent segments from your video.

## 2 Ways to Fade in Text in Premiere Pro

Every video is unappealing until you edit the video properly. Editing videos not only means trimming out unnecessary parts but also adding effects and animations. There are certain effects and transitions that are commonly used in most videos. Fade in effect is widely used in texts, objects, as well as clips. Fade in effect is very eye-soothing that does not distract the audience from the overall video content.

Fade in effect is available in all video editors. Among video editors, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the best professional video editors. However, the learning curve of Premiere Pro is steep and hence, you have to know the exact steps to add fade in text Premiere Pro. We will illustrate how to apply fade in text effect Pro as well as add fade in and fade out transition effects in Premiere Pro. We will also state an alternative way to fade in texts in your videos.

## Part 1\. Fade in text in Premiere Pro with Opacity option

If you have added any text or any graphical object in your video on Premiere Pro, you can apply fade in effect to your text and object easily. When you add fade in effect to your text or object, they slowly appear on the screen which is very soothing to watch instead of sudden and abrupt appearance. Here are the steps on how to fade text in Premiere Pro.

Step1 You must have your video clip as well as text clip on the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Make sure that you add text from Essential Graphics panel. Select the text clip from the Timeline to proceed.

![select text sample pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-text-sample-pr.jpg)

Step2 Go to Effect Controls and click on Text option to expand it. Click on Opacity option from the dropdown menu.

![click opacity in pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-opacity-in-pr.jpg)

Step3 Put the timeline cursor at the beginning of the selected text clip. Thereafter, make the Opacity value to zero. Click on Stopwatch icon beside Opacity to add a keyframe.

![make opacity to zero pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-opacity-to-zero-pr.jpg)

Step4 Put the timeline cursor at that point in the clip where you want the text to appear completely. Now make the Opacity value to 100\. Click on Stopwatch to add a keyframe here.

![make opacity to 100 pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-opacity-to-100-pr.jpg)

Step5 Play the video to watch the fade in effect on your selected text. You can move the keyframes to speed up or slow down fade in effect.

## Part 2\. Make fade in or out with transition effects

If you have multiple video clips or scenes, you should add fade in and fade out transition effects so that the transition from one clip to another or one scene to another is smooth. The fade in or fade out effect for video clips look similar to fade text Premiere Pro. In fact, you can use the steps of how to fade in text in Premiere Pro to get the job done. But there is an easier way available with Video Transitions option. Here are the steps on how to apply fade in or out effect on your video clips in Premiere Pro.

Step1 You should have multiple video clips added to Timeline. Select the video clip to which you want to apply Fade in effect.

Step2 Go to Effects panel and click on Video Transitions option.

![click video transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-video-transitions-pr.jpg)

Step3 Click on Dissolve and from the dropdown list, drag and drop Film Dissolve to the beginning of the selected video clip for fade in effect.

![drag film dissolve pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-film-dissolve-pr.jpg)

Step4 Click on the added effect on Timeline to adjust speed, duration, and alignment of the effect.

![adjust effects control pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjust-effects-control-pr.jpg)

Step5 Play the video to ensure that the effect looks perfect. Therefore, go to File> Share> Export File to save the video.

## Top 5 Ways To Convert Hdr To Sdr Videos

HDR or the High Dynamic Range Images points out the brightest and the darkest spots on an image, while an SDR has fewer details and colors. In comparison, HDR has a resolution four times as excellent as an SDR video. With a higher contrast ratio and color information, HDR videos are more vivid and pleasing.

Then why is there a need to convert HDR to SDR? An HDR file is huge and is currently incompatible with many old and some new devices. To view HDR videos, you need to lower the resolution and change the size of the file tidbit to convert it to 1080 SDR without compromising on the quality.

## Decode Video from HDR to SDR with a Video Converter

If you have ever worked with converting videos, then you are probably familiar with Handbrake. Handbrake is a household name for video converting, especially when it comes to 4KHDR to SDR video conversions. It has a free open source feature that allows you to convert to SDR videos with an MP4 or MKV format.

**Steps of Decoding HDR Video to SDR with Handbrake**

Before converting your HDR video to SDR, make sure you have downloaded Handbrake on your computer.

* **Open** the Handbrake app.
* To import your video to Handbrake, click on **File,** then **Source Selection.** You can also drag and drop the video to scan it. Next, wait for Handbrake to scan the title. Once the video scan is complete, all the information will be displayed in the source section.

![import a file into handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-3.jpg)

* Once the file is imported, you can now select the output format from the right panel under **General**. The default format already specified in Handbrake is Fast 1080p30; you can change that if you are looking for a different form.

![analysis of the upload hdr video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-5.jpg)

* You can also change the format depending on the device type in Handbrake.
* Lastly, go to **Presets**, click **Production**, and select **Production Standard** to convert 4K HDR video to 4K SDR. You can also do that by going to General Profile under the Legacy column.

![change the format from hdr to standard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-9.jpg)

## Transcode Video from HDR to SDR by Image Editing \[Samsung only\]

If you own the latest Samsung S22 phone, you are probably aware of its feature that allows you to record in an HDR10 view. But, what do you do if you want to send the video to someone whose phone is incompatible with HDR? The video will appear too bright and washed out.

By converting the video to SDR, you can send them the video without burning their retinas. This method to convert HDR videos to SDR is especially for Samsung Galaxy phones. The gallery app initially used to have a built-in option to do that, but it's not there anymore. While the original option is removed, you can still use the method below to convert an HDR video to SDR with just a few taps.

* To convert HDR10+ video to SDR on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you can directly proceed with it on your phone.
* Head to and open Gallery, choose your HDR10+ video and tap three dots in the bottom right corner.
* From the pop-up menu, select **Open in Video Player.**
* Once the video opens in the video player, click on another three dots in the top right corner.
* From there, tap on the **Editor**
* In the editor, tap again on three dots on the bottom right and now select Size and Format.
* From this menu, you can change the resolution of the video as well as its format. From the format drop-down, you can select SDR to convert your video to SDR.
* Make sure you do not tap on **Save;** instead, click on the three dots again and tap on Save as Copy. This will leave your original HDR video untouched and save a copy for the SDR video.

## Convert HDR 4K Video to SDR with YouTube \[Untested\]

HDR videos on Youtube show higher color dynamics and contrast ratios than an SDR video. Viewers with HDR-compatible devices will see ‘HDR’ after every video quality option in the video settings (1080p HDR).

However, the videos uploaded as HDR on youtube can be viewed on HDR unsupported devices too. This happens because youtube automatically converts all HDR videos to SDR to be viewed on non-HDR devices. Here is a brief introduction to the steps of converting HDR to SDR on Youtube:

* Record the metadata by exporting it from an HDR-supported application like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The metadata should be in a codec or container to be played by Youtube correctly.
* Grade your HDR properly as Rec. 2020 with PQ or HLG. Ensure the videos are graded correctly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are unsure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.
* rectly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are not sure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.

![color grading with wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-7.jpg)

* Once done, upload it on Youtube. If it detects HDR metadata during the upload, Youtube automatically produces an SDR conversion for non-HDR compatible devices.

![uploading the hdr video on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-8.jpg)

* Downloading the video from HDR unsupported devices will save an SDR video.

This method seems easy but has greater risks involved such as distortion of video if improper HDR grading is done.

## Get Real-time Video HDR to SDR Conversion by Video Content Providers

With gaming becoming almost a sport, online streaming has grown immensely popular. These streaming services allow you to stream in 4K HDR format. However, a significant downside of this is that many devices are still incompatible with HDR video.

We have listed multiple methods to convert your HDR video clips to SDR, but what about a live stream? We highly recommend checking out the Intel official blog post for converting your HDR videos to SDR in real-time. The blog post describes how you can convert your live stream to SDR with different methods. You can give it a read if you are interested in that.

## Hot FAQs on How to Convert HDR to SDR

### 1\. Is SDR better than HDR?

SDR is Standard Dynamic Range, while HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR is the latest technology concerning quality, clear and detailed images. HDR is perfect for videos that require high contrast, shadows, and mixed light.

HDR is definitely better than SDR because the “High” definition takes everything to the next level. However, SDR is frequently used as most devices are not compatible with HDR.

### 2\. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?

Undoubtedly, HDR provides better image quality, colors, and clarity than SDR, but why is the file size smaller then? The answer is quite simple. HDR10 files are equipped with HVAC. HVAC is a very efficient file compressor that compresses the file while keeping its quality intact. SDR files are not compressed with SDR; hence the file size is much bigger.

### 3\. Why does HDR look washed out?

An HDR video might look too bright or washed out if your device is incompatible with HDR color space. Unlike the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S22, phones have a built-in HDR recording feature. However, older versions may not be able to enjoy the clarity and colors offered by an HDR recording. Hence when an HDR video is sent to someone with an older phone, it looks as if the video is washed out.

## Final Words

While HDR might be a superior color space, SDR is frequently used for video clips so maximum people can enjoy the video despite what their devices are compatible with. You can easily convert an HDR video to SDR using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or any other methods listed above.

An important point to note is that HDR videos converted to SDR might look a little off sometimes with darker shadows and sharpness. It might be a better idea to record in SDR rather than convert it to SDR later. However, converting is still a popular way to go with an HDR video; you will also have a beautiful high-quality video and an SDR copy.

## Elevate Your Designs with Feather Shapes in After Effects

Feathering shapes in After Effects can greatly enhance your designs' overall look and feel. This technique involves creating a soft, blurred edge around the shapes, which adds a sense of depth and dimension. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced After Effects user, understanding how to feather shapes is a valuable skill to have in your arsenal.

This guide will cover everything you need about feathering shapes in After Effects. From the basics to advanced techniques, you'll learn how to add a professional touch to your designs and take your skills to the next level.

Whether you're creating a logo, animation, or visual effect, the ability to feather shapes will help you achieve the desired look and feel for your project. So, let's dive in and explore the world of feathering in After Effects!

## What Is Mask Edge Feather in After Effects?

Mask Edge Feather in After Effects is a feature that enables you to create a soft or blurred transition between the masked and unmasked areas of your composition. The mask feather setting can be found in the properties and is measured in pixels. Increasing the feather value increases the softness or blurriness of the mask's edges, creating a smoother transition between the masked and unmasked parts of the image.

One of the key benefits of feathering masks is that it allows you to blend the masked object with its background, making the effect look more natural and convincing. The mask feather tool can also create custom feather shapes anywhere along the edge of the mask. To access the mask feather tool, switch to the pen tool by pressing the "**G**" key and selecting the feather pen.

The mask edge feather feature in After Effects is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you achieve a wide range of creative effects. Whether you're creating an animation or visual effect, or want to add a professional touch to your designs, understanding how to use the mask feather tool is an essential skill in your After Effects toolkit.

### How To Feather a Shape in After Effects?

Feathering a shape in After Effects is a simple process that can greatly enhance the look and feel of your designs. By following these steps, you'll be able to easily feather shapes in After Effects and add a professional touch to your designs.

Keep in mind that the feather value can be adjusted to your preference and the needs of your project, so feel free to experiment and see what works best for you.

There are two options to feather the edge in After Effects:

**A. Adding a Mask to Shape Layer**

### How To Use Variable Mask Feather in After Effects?

Variable mask feather in After Effects allows you to create masks with variable feathering. It means you can have different feather values for different parts of the same mask. This feature gives you greater control and flexibility over your masks, allowing you to easily create complex effects and transitions.

With variable mask feathers, you can create complex effects, such as a shape that feathers more in one direction than the other. Or you can create a mask with a soft transition in one area and a hard transition in another.

## 1\. What is a Lower Third?

![What is a Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-01.jpg)

What is a Lower Third

A lower third is text and/or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.

A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.

Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.

## 2\. Why Add A Lower Third

So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”

Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.

In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.

![Why Add A Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-02.jpg)

Why Add A Lower Third

Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.

As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Tips:** A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.

## 3\. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third

As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.

[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.

Tip #1

###### Use Readable Font

Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.

Tip #2

###### Don’t Make It Too Long

There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.

Tip #3

###### Use Branding

A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.

Tip #4

###### Use Templates

Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.

Tip #5

###### Keep It Simple

Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don't use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.

Tip #6

###### Emphasize With Your Lower Third

Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.

## 4\. Step By Step To Explain Filmora

Using [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it is extremely easy to create a lower third for your video.

3. **Boosts Discoverability:** Strategic keywords in captions can make your videos more discoverable, especially as users search for specific content on TikTok.
4. **It's Your Brand's Voice:** Established TikTokers have a recognizable style. Your captions can become a part of your brand's unique voice, making you distinguishable in a sea of creators.

## EasyHDR Review: Is This a Good Choice to Create HDR

Any professional photographer knows that “photography” is a broad niche. For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you'll need an HDR program like **EasyHDR**. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether **Easy HDR** is worth the money or not. We'll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.

## Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR

| Description      | EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos. It supports raw images and batch processing. |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pricing          | $33 for a lifetime license                                                                                                        |
| Operating System | Windows 7/8/10/11 and macOS 10.12 or newer                                                                                        |
| Layout           | 4.5/5                                                                                                                             |
| Easy to use      | 4.8/5                                                                                                                             |
| HDQ quality      | 4.2/5                                                                                                                             |
| Post-processing  | 3.5/5                                                                                                                             |

Before we dive deeper into this **Easy HDRi** review, let's first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:

### 1\. Effectiveness - 4.8/5

The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn't have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.

### 2\. Price - 4.7/5

Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there's a free demo version, it's pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.

### 3\. Supported OS - 5/5

This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!

### 4\. Ease of use - 4.8

Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.

### 5\. Best for - Beginner HDRi editors

This program's simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you're a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.

**Our Verdict**

Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.

The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33/lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.

But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it's the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.

 Pros

* Simple layout.
* Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.
* Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.
* Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.
* Batch processing supported.
* Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.

 Cons

* It doesn't have advanced HDR post-processing tools.
* No HDR feature for editing.

## Part 2\. Detailed Review for Easy HDR

Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it's important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can't save HDRi in TIFF format. Let's get in!

### 1\. High-Quality Bracket Merging

A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.

### 2\. Editing features

EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.

### 3\. Ghost removal

No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.

### 4\. HDR batch processing

As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.

### 5\. LDR enhancement

Although we've mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it's important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.

## Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop

Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.

With that in mind, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It's a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you'll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. Filmora 11 works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key/green screen, etc.

**Steps to add an HDR effect to a standard video on Filmora 11:**

##### Step1Open the video on Filmora 11

Before we dive deeper into this **Easy HDRi** review, let's first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:

### 1\. Effectiveness - 4.8/5

The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn't have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.

### 2\. Price - 4.7/5

Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there's a free demo version, it's pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.

### 3\. Supported OS - 5/5

This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!

### 4\. Ease of use - 4.8

Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.

### 5\. Best for - Beginner HDRi editors

This program's simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you're a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.

**Our Verdict**

Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.

The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33/lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.

But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it's the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.

 Pros

* Simple layout.
* Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.
* Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.
* Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.
* Batch processing supported.
* Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.

 Cons

* It doesn't have advanced HDR post-processing tools.
* No HDR feature for editing.

## Part 2\. Detailed Review for Easy HDR

Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it's important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can't save HDRi in TIFF format. Let's get in!

### 1\. High-Quality Bracket Merging

A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.

### 2\. Editing features

EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.

### 3\. Ghost removal

No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.

### 4\. HDR batch processing

As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.

### 5\. LDR enhancement

Although we've mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it's important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.

## Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop

Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.

With that in mind, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It's a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you'll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. Filmora 11 works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key/green screen, etc.

**Steps to add an HDR effect to a standard video on Filmora 11:**

##### Step1Open the video on Filmora 11

## How Long Does It Take To Edit A Video

If you want to put together the pieces for online videos the number one thing most of the time takes is **editing.**

**Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?**

* **Too many choices.**

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

## **3\.** **Davinci Resolve for Mac.**

The Davinci Resolve is the most professional video editing software on Mac. It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free. Along with this, it is very professional video editing software that people used to create Hollywood movies and that kind of stuff. It provides a very easy and professional interphase that anyone can use without having training.

* The controls and features in the software are amazing and can edit videos **frame by frame.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-14.jpg)

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-15.jpg)

That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a **finishing application** of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

The great news is you don’t have to go out and buy a video editor or search for the video editor to download on your system instead if you are Windows 10 you already have some awesome software to edit your videos.

## **2\.** **CapCut App for Android.**

CapCut is the best video editing app, whether you are making videos for youtube, TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook. It is a free and all-in-one video editing app and you can use it without watermarks and annoying ads. The good thing about this app is, that it is very easy to use.

## **3\.** **Davinci Resolve for Mac.**

The Davinci Resolve is the most professional video editing software on Mac. It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free. Along with this, it is very professional video editing software that people used to create Hollywood movies and that kind of stuff. It provides a very easy and professional interphase that anyone can use without having training.

* The controls and features in the software are amazing and can edit videos **frame by frame.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-12.jpg)

* There is also a dedicated area for **audio creation**.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-13.jpg)

* The **motion graphics** and

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-14.jpg)

* A specific area just for **color grading** and **color correcting.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-15.jpg)

That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a **finishing application** of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

## Part 1 What Is AI Upscaling? And Why AI Upscaling Is Significant?

The process of generating or creating additional pixels of an image or frame in a video is AI Upscaling. This has many good results on the final video output.

This is mainly done to raise the bit rate of the video and, therefore, slightly improve the visual quality of the video. This is also used to improve the picture quality of DVDs and other low-quality videos. It is done to support lower quality videos or pictures on higher resolution screens like TV. This kind of upscaling is mostly done in TVs automatically.

## Part 2 How to Easily AI Upscale Video to 1080p or 4K?

The interesting part is that this upscaling is done by the higher resolution device itself.

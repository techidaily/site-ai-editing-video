Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.

![merge-clips-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-12.jpeg)

You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.

![merge-clips-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-13.jpeg)

Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.

## Related FAQs About End Screen Maker

**1.** **How Do You Make an End Screen?**

Making an end screen is different depending on the tool that you use to create the end screen as well as the number of elements that you choose to add to it. But usually, you would start with a template and begin adding elements to the project one by one.

**2.What is the Best Free Outro Maker?**

The best tool to create an end screen for YouTube videos is Filmora simply because it makes the process very easy while allowing you to customize your creation as much as you need. But even though it has a free trial version, most of the features you need to create a unique end screen are not available on the free plan.

A good free solution would be Canva because it has numerous free resources that can create a decent end screen. Although we must point out that many of the best templates and elements on Canva are also not available for free.

**3.How Long can a YouTube End Screen Be?**

A typical end screen is often 5-20 seconds long. You don’t need any more than 20 seconds because it is only used as a way to promote additional content or add a call to action. So when creating an End screen, ensure that all elements are clear enough as your audience will have only 20 seconds to see it.

Even though it is just 20 seconds long, the end screen of your YouTube video can be the most important aspect of the entire video. It is a great way to further engage with your audience and with the tools on

this list, you can now create the best end screen for your video.

Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video.

This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.

While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.

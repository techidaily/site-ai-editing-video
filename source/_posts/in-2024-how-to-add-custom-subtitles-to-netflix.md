## How to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix

Netflix is the most popular streaming service in the world. It offers loads of movies and series that you can watch on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Over the years, Netflix has become a one-stop destination for watching movies and TV shows in different languages.

While the user base of Netflix is quite diverse, the platform offers subtitles in limited languages for most movies and series. Suppose you want to view a Korean Drama on Netflix with French subtitles. However, you found that French subtitles are unavailable for that Korean Drama. In such a case, you might wonder if adding custom subtitles to Netflix is possible.

Well, you can add subtitles to Netflix, and there are two different methods to do the same. This guide will help you learn both methods available for adding custom subtitles to Netflix. So, let's get started!

## Method 1\. Upload Your Custom Subtitle to Netflix

Before proceeding with this method, you must remember that it only works if you are a Netflix Premium user. Now, let's discuss how to add subtitles to Netflix with this method.

### Key Steps to Follow

Below are the steps for adding custom subtitles to Netflix.

Step 1 First of all, you need to install and add [Language Learning with Netflix & YouTube™](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/bekopgepchoeepdmokgkpkfhegkeohbl?hl=en-US) extension to your web browser (Chrome or Edge).

Step 2 Make sure the extension is activated.

Step 3 Download the .srt file that contains the subtitles in your preferred language for a particular movie or TV show.

Step 4 Open Netflix on a Chrome or Edge browser and sign into your account.

Step 5 Play the movie or TV show for which you have downloaded the subtitles.

Step 6 Within the Netflix player, you will see a settings icon left to the **Subtitles** icon. Click on it.

Step 7 Among the various setting options, you need to choose the screen and find the one with the label "Lower Subtitles (Mother Language)". You need to click on its field and select the "Upload Subtitle" option.

Step 8 You will see a pop-up window at the top of the screen where you need to click the "Choose File" button.

Step 9 You then need to navigate to the directory on your computer where you have downloaded the subtitles file, select it, and click the "Open" button.

Step 10 Click the "Okay" button to upload the subtitles to Netflix.

Step 11 Close the settings window and play the video. You can view the uploaded subtitles at the bottom of the player.

## Method 2\. Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Extensions

If you're not a Netflix Premium user, you can still add subtitles to Netflix with the help of certain browser extensions. We'll list them down and discuss the steps for using one of them; the basic steps for using all such extensions are pretty much the same.

### 1\. Substital

**Supported web browsers:** [C](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en)[hrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/substital/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/substital-add-subtitles-/dkkffblkjnedaekodhiblomkicklmjnp?source=sfwOPERA)

Substital is among the most popular extensions that allow you to add subtitles to several online on-demand video streaming platforms, including Netflix. It has more than 100K users on the Chome Web Store.

**Key Features**

* Offers a built-in subtitles search feature.
* Supports .srt files and .zip files containing subtitles in the .srt format.
* You can manually sync the subtitles with the video.
* It allows you to customize the appearance of subtitles.

**Steps to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Substital**

Following are the key steps to add custom subtitles to Netflix using the Substital extension:

Step 1 The first thing you need to do is to download and install the Substital extension on your browser.

Step 2 Open Netflix on the same browser and log in to your account.

Step 3 Play the movie or episode from a TV series for which you want to add custom subtitles.

Step 4 Download the subtitles file for the same movie or episode in your preferred language from the web.

Step 5 Now open the extensions menu in your browser and click on the Substital icon.

Step 6 You will see the name of the movie or TV show that you are watching on Netflix. Click on it.

Step 7 In this step, you need to drag and drop the subtitle file from your system (that you downloaded earlier) to the browser window.

Step 8 Finally, you can notice that the subtitles are loaded in the Netflix player.

### 2\. Super Netflix

**Web browsers:** [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-netflix/iakpdiefpdniabbekcbofaanjcpjkloe)

Super Netflix is yet another reliable extension to add subtitles to Netflix. Apart from adding custom subtitles, this extension allows you to change the video playback speed. Like Substital, the Super Netflix extension on Chrome Web Store also has 100K+ users.

**Key Features**

* It can help you avoid spoilers by blurring images and episode descriptions.
* You can use the extension to skip intros automatically.

Unlike the other two extensions mentioned above, Netflix SubStyler only allows you to change the styling of subtitles on Netflix. However, the thing that makes this extension worthy of your attention is that it comes loaded with several customization options.

* You can choose a custom text color for the subtitles either with the help of an in-built color picker or by entering the RGB value of the color.
* The extension lets you add text outlines and change the size of the text.

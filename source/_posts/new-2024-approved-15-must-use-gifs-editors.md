## Create Risograph Effect In Photoshop: A Beginner’s Guide

Risograph printing is a digital printing process that combines the best features of offset and screen printing used by many small print shops and design studios to provide trendy vibes and a classic look to the images.

If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you **create a risograph effect in Photoshop** quickly!

Without further delay, let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial!

## What Is Risograph Effect?

Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop [in the later part of this article](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.

Risograph was created in **1986** by a Japanese company called **Riso Kagaku Corporation.** It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.

The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph's unique charm and distinct look.

The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.

## How To Use Photoshop To Create Risograph Effect

The tutorial will be divided into three parts to help you master the risograph effect-creating skills to give your design project a distinct look.

Firstly, we will focus on how to use Photoshop in the following way to create the primary risograph effect.

### How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Step1 Launch [**Adobe Photoshop**](https://www.adobe.com/) on your laptop/desktop (For this tutorial, we are using Photoshop CC 2021). Click **“Create New,”** select the document size, and click **“Create.”** Now set a paper-like textured layer on the canvas. Click **“Ctrl + Shift + N,”** and in the new layer window, set the mode to **“Multiply.”** Click **“OK.”** to confirm your action.

![adding new layer to create risograph effect in photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-new-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step2 Next, press **“Ctrl+Shift+E”** to combine your layers and select the **“Edit”** option from the top toolbar. Scroll down and select **“Define Pattern.”** Set the pattern name and click **“OK.”**

![select edit option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/defining-pattern-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Click **"Layer"** from the toolbar and choose **"New Fill Layer"> "Pattern."** Next, select your new pattern layer and click **"OK"** to get a grid layer.

![choose new fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-grid-pattern-to-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step3 Let's place an object/subject onto our canvas. Set the issue to "**Multiply**," right-click on it and choose "**Convert to Smart Object**."

![choose convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-main-object-to-smart-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step4 To add a Gradient Map Layer, click **“Layer,”** scroll down and click **“New Adjustment Layer.”** Select **“Gradient Map…”** from the drop-down menu and click **“OK”** to confirm.

![click layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/selecting-gradient-map-from-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Use the **“Properties”** panel and select the **“gradient”** colors. Here we’ve chosen shades of **“White”** and **“Red.”** Click **“OK”** to apply.

![select the gradient color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-gradient-map-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step5 For the image to have less contrast, click **“Image”** in the top toolbar and click **“Adjustments.”** Select **“Levels…”** from the menu. Now, set the black output to **73.**

![click image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-adjustment-level-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Finally, click **“Filter”** and open the **“Filter Gallery.”** Select **“Sketch” > “Torn Edge,”** set Image balance to **30,** smoothness, and contrast to **15, 15** respectively. Click **“OK”** to apply the changes.

![click filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-filter-gallery-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

### How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect

After creating an image with the risograph effect, how to make it more visually vertical? At this time, the dual-tone impact will help us have a more delicate picture.

The dual-tone effect is a technique in the risograph effect that combines two or more overlapping images to give a more vibrant look to the final project or emphasize the critical concept, information, or idea.

To create a dual-tone risograph effect in Photoshop, do the following steps.

Step1 To create a dual-tone risograph effect, add another subject to the canvas and set the blending mode to **Multiply.** Also, change its opacity to blend the two issues well. Make sure to turn the subject to **Smart Object** by right-clicking on the object's layer and selecting **"Convert to Smart Object."** Adjust the position of the subject on the previous one.

![add another subject to the canvas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-subject-to-smart-object-in-photoshop-to-create-risograph-effect.png)

Step2 Select the layer of the new subject and click **“Layer”** Click **“New Adjustment Layer”** and select **“Gradient Map…”** from the drop-down menu.

Open the Gradient Editor and set the gradient colors of the new subject. Click **“OK”** to confirm. Click **“Image”** and choose **“Adjustments”** from the drop-down menu. Select **“Levels”** and set the **Black Output** to **73.**

Step3 Click **“Filter”** and open **“Filter Gallery.”** Navigate to **“Swatches” > “Torn Edge”** and set the **Image Balance, Smoothness, and Contrast** to **30, 15, and 15,** respectively, if you want to smooth down the subject.

Finally, your dual-tone effect is created in Photoshop!

### How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes

In this part, let’s see how to use the layer modes to add another subject to the canvas and blend it with the previous ones.

Step1 Place the new subject on the canvas and set the layer mode to **Multiply** by pressing the **“Ctrl + Shift + N”** and selecting **“Multiply”** from the drop-down menu in the new pop-up window. Click **“Ok”** to apply your changes.

To adjust the size of the object, click **“Edit”** from the top toolbar, and select **“Transform.”** From the drop-down menu, select **“Scale.”** Use the handles to make the object smaller or larger.

Step2 Click the **“Move”** icon from the left menu and drag the object to set its position. Now, copy and clip the **Gradient mode** from the main subject to the new one.

Step3 Apply the **Level** and **Filter Galler** to the new object (Same settings as the main subject). That’s it. You’ve successfully blended images using the layer mode.

![apply the level and filter galler](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/blending-image-using-layer-modes-to-create-risograph-effect.png)

## Dollar-Store DIY Hacks to Use for Filmmaking on a Budget

Filmmaking is usually an expensive hobby, but slowly over time, it's become more affordable. Regular gear like cameras and lights are slightly cheaper, but there are plenty of ways to DIY regular items to use as film gear.

Making DIY film gear may not give you the same look as professional gear, but it could be a fun project and give you similar looks on a budget. In this article, let's look at some dollar-store DIY hacks that you can use for filmmaking on a budget.

![diy film gear](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-1.png)

## Tip 1\. Add foreground elements to improve the frame of videos

Let's start with something we can do to enhance your framing. Sometimes we want to direct our audience's attention to a specific part of the frame. In this case, it's the talent of placing an object in the shot's foreground that can help us do that. While also making a more attractive frame. At the dollar store, try using something like these fake plants.

![fake plants](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-2.png)

You can place it in front of your lens. Then focus on the talent behind it, giving a blurry foreground that perfectly frames the talent. Here's how the shot looks with and without foreground elements.

![framing the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Remember, you can also use a **different angle** than simply approaching the object from the front. You can try and use different perspectives until you find the shot or footage you are looking for.

## Tip 2\. Adjust lights with poster boards

The shot below looks dark and boring because the background has no light. Here's the shot with and without the lights.

![shot with or without lights](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-4.png)

A practical light is a light that shows up on screen rather than lighting talent from off-screen. For example, some dollar stores have small LED accent lights for around three dollars.

Others even have lights with adhesive backings that allow you to place them all over the room—creating great lighting accents with small eye-catching pockets of light.

![lights with adhesive backings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-5.png)

On film sets, crews use a bounce to reflect light from one light source in another direction. At the dollar store, we can find something like this poster board to get a similar effect.

![use bounce to reflect light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-6.png)

By reflecting the light onto the bounce, we get softer, more spread-out light when it's reflected. Then you will get the result in a nicer look. Using poster boards, you can do multiple things with light.

* Use white to bounce light.
* Use black as a flag to shape or block light.

![use white to bounce light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-7.png)

* You can also use green for a small green screen when filming a product video

You might have seen how big production companies create those alienated landscapes, such as in the movie Avatar and many more.

The concept is recording your object in front of a green screen behind it. Then, it's much easier to add a separately filmed background to the final footage with a video editor like Filmora.

![green screen to create the fake background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-8.gif)

## Tip 3\. Smooth audio with felt pads or socks

Do you ever have audio pop while you are recording? It can get annoying. So, to fix the issues, we are now teaching you three practical ways.

### 1\. Felt pads

Felt pads with adhesive backs can be stuck onto noisy props like a coffee mug. This way, we won't hear the mug hitting the table when we're recording sound.

![felt pads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-9.png)

### 2\. Socks as pop filters

Professionals use what they call a pop filter because a pop filter can reduce the loud pops from their mouths. But what is pop? Pops usually occur when people say words that start with the letter P or B.

Then what is a pop filter? You might have seen in some YouTube videos, especially live streamers, where they use a microphone with a plate on its head; that's called a pop filter. You can purchase pricey gear like a pop filter, or we can get a pack of cheap socks at the dollar store and place them over the mic.

It will make your voiceover slightly quieter, but it should also get rid of the popping. So keep adding socks until you hear no more pops in your voiceover.

![add socks to a mic to make voice quieter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-10.png)

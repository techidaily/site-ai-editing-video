## Tutorial on How to Create an Intro Using Renderforest

Professional video creators are likely aware that starting a video without a suitable introduction is equivalent to sneaking into someone's house without permission. A good intro is a doorbell to let people know you've arrived.

A strong introduction ensures that more people will view your film. Adults have an attention span of about 12 seconds, according to studies from 2000\. It is now only 8 seconds. You have 8 seconds to entice viewers to watch your video, so don't waste it. A captivating introduction will give your content a professional touch and pique your audience's interest. This task is worthwhile if you want to advertise your videos successfully.

These days, you don't necessarily need to hire a pro to make a film if you need one. The majority of the available tools are free. We'll demonstrate in this lesson how to use Renderforest to create a polished video intro. Our intro maker will let you start strong, whether for a fun birthday video or commercial use.

When you're prepared to begin producing your videos, go to Renderforest, register for an account, or sign in if you already have one.

Check out the vast selection of templates under "**Intros and logos**" in the "**Create Video**" section of the navigation menu. Here, you can select the intro you like most and begin altering it, or use our advanced search filters to locate the specific content you require.

![select intros and logos renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-intros-and-logos-renderforest.jpg)

We'll use the "**Swift Glitch Logo**" template for this tutorial, enabling you to present your logo with glitch effects. This template may produce intro and outro movies for presentations, your YouTube channel, lobby backgrounds, and other uses.

Select your preferred template and click the "**Create now**" button to start.

Your logo should now be uploaded with a transparent background (PNG). You can upload it in one of three ways: using an image URL directly from your device or selecting an existing file from your "Media library." If you don't already have one, you may make one right away using our logo maker tool, which is also accessible in the editor.

Write your company's name, tagline, or other brief words in the text field once you've added your logo. To save the changes, don't forget to click "Save and close."

You can select the overall design of your logo and the preferred font style in the "Style" section.

Go to the "**Music**" area to select a song for your intro. You can add one or pick from our "**Music collection**." You can record a voice-over in the editor or upload one for your introduction.

## Competition to Renderforest

Animoto and PowToon are a couple of the site's main rivals. These are excellent online video editing tools, but Renderforest stands out because it is simple to use and enables even novice users to create, share quickly, and download "broadcast grade videos."

**Renderforest vs PowToon**

One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It's challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.

PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn't provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.

PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.

Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.

Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.

Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.

Fortunately, you don't have to believe us. You may experience all the main advantages of Renderforest yourself by giving it a try. Check out the pros and drawbacks list in our Renderforest review if you need more assistance.

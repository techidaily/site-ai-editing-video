* It allows you to edit videos in any format and from any device.
* It provides you with simple tools to rotate, trim, combine, split, and crop videos.
* It includes free effects such as titles, filters, transitions, motion elements, face-off, and more.
* It is completely free.

**Steps to rotate videos in Filmora:**

Simply open the wonder share filmora editing app and import your desired video to time line.

Right click on the imported video and select Rotate 90ccw until video is on your desired direction and you can simply export the video and enjoy it!

Now we have to deal with the elephant in the room: is KM Player superior, or is Wonder Share Filmora more user-friendly in terms of operation and video rotation? In general, both softwares are equally effective at rotating videos and completing tasks, but Wonder Share Filmora appears to be a significantly better and more user-friendly option. Wonder Share Filmora is powerful video editing software that allows you to learn more about video editing and take your skills to a higher level of proficiency.

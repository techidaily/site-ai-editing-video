## An Ultimate Guide to Edit a Music Video: Aspect Ratio and First Cut

Are you planning to edit your music video? Do you need on out how to edit your first music video draft? Editing a music video is a creative task but can be challenging.

One of the key elements of this process is selecting the aspect ratio and making the first cut. In this blog, we will explore these steps in detail, providing important tips and tricks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced editor, get ready to take your music video to the next level. Let's get started.

## Which software will you need?

As we have a lot of software in the market, we must select the right software for high-quality editing. [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an amazing video editing software. It offers a ton of video editing tools. You can add special effects, transitions, and more to make your music video captivating.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

**Note:** Before you start editing your project, make sure that you have a backup. You can copy the project to an external USB or hard drive for a backup.

## Adjust the aspect ratio

The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3\. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.

You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won't shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you'll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.

![some common aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/some-common-aspect-ratios.jpg)

### How to find the width/height of the frame?

Most of the frames that are being shot on the camera are 3424 pixels wide, which is a little under 4k. If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let's suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.

**Formula:** 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)

![1st step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/1st-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you can cancel out the width from the multiplier and the denominator.

\= 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide

![2nd step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/2nd-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you are left with the equation:

\= 3424 pixels high / 2.35

After solving this equation, you will get the answer which is: 1457 pixels high. Let's adjust it on the music video as well, follow the steps given below:

![changing the width and the height](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/changing-the-width-and-the-height.jpg)

## Assembly

The next step is assembly. You will arrange the shots, clips, and elements in this process and get everything in order. It can be daunting and inspiring for you, as it's a blank canvas you are going to start with. Before editing, you can also get some guidance from your art director.

If your music video has shots of the band performing, drop them off first and sync them with the audio. On the contrary, if you are doing a narrative style, you can arrange the shots according to the story you want to portray.

![graphical text of assembly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-assembly.jpg)

##### Step1Drop the media

You can start by dragging and dropping the music onto the audio timeline. Then you can add the shots of your music video.

![dropping the media onto the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dropping-the-media-onto-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step2Arrange the shots

Arrange the shots according to the storyboard you created and sync them with the audio.

![arranging the shots in order](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/arranging-the-shots-in-order.gif)

##### Step3Add the title

Once you arrange all shots in order, you can add the title of your music video. Click on the **Titles**, then choose your desired style and add the name of your music video in the title box. You can also change the text's size, font, and color.

![adding the title of the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-the-title-of-the-music-video.jpg)

##### Step4Flip the clip

One last thing is, if you shot any scene in mirror-image format, you can flip it. Click on the clip you want to flip and select the flip icon in the video properties.

![flipping the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/flipping-the-clip.jpg)

## Send your first draft

The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.

Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.

For first drafts, you don't need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.

### How to add the timer in the music video?

1. Click on **Effects** and search for **Timecode** in the search bar.
2. Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.
3. Extend the timer to the end of the video.
4. Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.

![adding timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-timer.gif)

Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.

## Conclusion

We hope this blog has helped you edit the initials of your music video. By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.

These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.

## What Is HDRI? Everything You Need to Know About HDRI

Photography is like art itself. Photographers must carefully select the setting and use the right camera to capture images with lossless quality. However, you'll realize that some photos appear darker or brighter than in actual life.

In that case, use **free HDRI** software to change that straightway. But HDRI being a relatively new technique, beginners might struggle to edit the photos, let alone find the perfect HDRI software.

So, in this simple guidepost, we'll learn how to create an HDRI 3D picture using **HDRI for Blender**. But first, let's understand what an HDRI file is and the difference between HDRI and HDR.

## Part 1: What is HDRI?

HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) is simply an image created using multiple image overlays of the same background but with varying exposures. The exposures can range from the brightest highlights to the darkest shadows. So, in short, HDRI expands an image's dynamic range to brighten or darken it and make it look more natural.

Having said that, HDRI is a raster image created using color pixels. HDRI photos are generally significant in size, so they won't quickly lose quality like other raster photos such as PNG and JPG. Many formats can store HDRI images, although the most common are OpenEXR (.exr) and Radiance RGBE (.hdr).

 Pros

* You can easily create one using HDRI for Blender, Photoshop, EasyHDRI, etc.
* HDRI photos are compatible with many image editing programs.
* Produces crisp images with excellent detail and lighting control.

 Cons

* 32-bit HDRI files have significant sizes.
* HDRI can quickly be poorly done without prior experience.

## Part 2: What's the difference between HDR and HDRI

According to Wikipedia, HDR and HDRI are the same things. But is it true? For starters, HDRI is basically a photo with High Dynamic Range qualities. So, yes, HDR and HDRI can mean the same thing in digital image editing.

However, some photo editors argue that there is a difference between these two regarding basic workflow. First, HDR technology increases brightness to show more image details. On the other hand, HDRI performs unique optimization of content and lighting to deliver crisp images. In other words, HDRI brightens the dark shadows without necessarily overexposing the bright image areas.

Some photographers can also consider HDR as images with pixel values higher than 1 or 255\. That means that the pixels can be much higher than pure white. But technically speaking, HDR and HDRI can be used interchangeably.

## Part 3: When to use HDRI

Now that you have all the information about HDRI, let's learn about some industries where HDRI is applicable.

### 1\. HDRI for 3D visualization and 3D animation

**HDRI 3D** is commonplace these days. 3D animation creators can use programs like **HDRI Blender** to add HDR environments and make the content look detailed and more realistic in high lighting reflections. To put it simply, HDRI makes 3D scenes look lighter, less cartoonish, and more professional. This technology can also be used in interior visualizations in animations.

### 2\. HDRI for architect rendering

Creating HDRI environments is a common practice in 3D architectural designs. For example, designers can create panoramic house designs with varying light tones and interior moods. HDRI helps them give a natural 3D lighting effect on scenes and objects.

### 3\. HDRI monitors and TVs

You've probably heard of **HDRI 4K** when shopping for a smart TV or computer monitor. These TVs offer a lot more than just a wide color gamut, high brightness, and advanced contrast ratio. In addition, HDR TVs and monitors can recognize HDR signals, allowing viewers to watch the content with all studio quality. In short, viewers can see more color details in shadowy and lighter scenes, making them perfect for avid gamers.

## Part 4: How do you open an HDRI?

Because HDRIs use low dynamic range rendering, a standard display panel won't open HDR images. So, to open an HDRI file on a non-HDR display, you'll need to convert it to a different low dynamic range format using tone mapping technology. For example, you convert HDRI to JPEG or PNG and enjoy regular bitmaps while maintaining the HDRI properties. You can also open and edit HDRI using desktop programs like EasyHDR, Photoshop, and Blender.

## Part 5: How to set up an HDR environment background?

Before wrapping up this blog post, let's discuss how to use [HDRI for Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to apply HDR effects to an image's background. Blender is a 100% free program for creating jaw-dropping 3D rendering and animations on Mac and Windows computers. With Blender, you'll get an advanced modeling toolset like retopology, curves, sculpting, and more. But in this post, we'll learn how to create an HDR environment or add lighting to your image project. Let's get started!

Step1Install and run Blender and then tap the World Properties tab. Then, click the Color icon and add Environment Texture.

![free hdri for blender open world properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-1.jpg)

Step3On the Environment Texture, tap Open Image before opening the 3.2 folder inside the Blender Foundation folder. Then, click Data files > Studiolights > Word. Now open a .exr file. For example, open the Interior.exr image.

![free hdri for blender open exr file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-3.jpg)

Step4Click the Viewport Shading icon and tap the drop-down button to choose Interior. You'll see all the lighting reflections inside the room and customize it as you wish. That's it!

![free hdri for blender open viewport shading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-4.jpg)

## Conclusion

Using the environment maps is the simplest and most effective way to lighten up your 3D scenes in Blender. This program lets you achieve realistic 3D scenes, mimicking natural world lighting. But note that Blender can be a little confusing for beginners. So, play around with this HDRI tool, and you'll be a pro in no time.

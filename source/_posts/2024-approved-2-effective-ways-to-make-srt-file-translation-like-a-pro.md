## Vintage Film Effect 1990S - How to Make

In the 90s, movie production technology improved a lot. This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological. In fact, we can say that the horror movies of the 90s laid the foundation for current horror movies. So, without wasting time, let's create a 1990s horror movie similar to The Blair Witch Project.

## Preparation

![1990s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1990s-vintage-scene.gif)

The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you've watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It's even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.

How to create a 1990s horror film with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1 Add the horror video to the timeline

![add the horror video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-1.jpg)

Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.

##### Step2 Apply color grading

![apply color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-2.jpg)

Next, double-click the horror clip and go to the **Color** menu. Then, click the **Tone** arrow before lowering the **Saturation** to -50%. This will give us a less saturated look popularly used in horror films.

![double-click the horror clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-3.jpg)

Now click the **3D LUT** option and choose a LUT that works for your film. For this horror film project, we'll select the **Dark Film** option.

##### Step3 Add creepiness to the video

![add creepiness to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-4.jpg)

## How To Quickly Create A Screen Print Effect In Photoshop: Detailed Gui

**Screen printing** is a unique method that uses a mesh to transfer ink onto a surface and is commonly used to print designs onto t-shirts or other garments, such as hoodies, tote bags, and even sneakers.

Nowadays, digital means such as Photoshop or Illustrator are used to create the screen print effect, which is achieved by using a layer mask to cut out a portion of the image and filling it with the color or pattern of your choice. The design is then printed onto fabric using water-based [CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel) (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) inks with inkjet printers.

Suppose you’ve ever wanted to create the screen print effect in Photoshop to give that artistic look to your pictures and embed them in your clothes or other accessories but don’t know where to start or are not familiar with the process. In that case, this guide can surely help you figure this out quickly!

So without any delay, let’s get on with it!

## How To Use Photoshop To Create The Print Effect

Before we discuss the complete process of creating the print effect while using Photoshop, here are the resources you have to arrange.

* **Picture of the object:** We will cut out the object from the original image using the Lasso tool and unsaturate it. However, you have to ensure that the object is clear and easily detectable within the picture.
* **A background image:** You will need a background image to add the object to. For this, you can use a solid background, capture scenery, etc.
* **Fonts**: You can also add fonts to the final image to add your ideas or thoughts, making your final project more eye-catching and engaging.
* **Photoshop latest version:** For this tutorial, we will use the Photoshop CC 2021 version, so make sure to download and install it to your computer immediately!

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Giphy Capture**

#### 1\. Once you’ve opened GIPHY Capture - open up your browser, video, or whatever you want to record. Adjust the size of your GIPHY capture frame by grabbing any of the sides or corners and stretching to your desired frame size

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-9.jpg)

After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.

You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.

You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-10.jpg)

1. Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.

1. Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.

1. If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.

### **GIFROCKET**

**Supported OS:** Mac

GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you've downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.

The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.

**Features:**

* Intuitive interface
* Change quality and file size of the outputted file

**Cons:**

* Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket**

1. After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the _Settings_ button. Here you’ll get three fields.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg)

1. Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the _Hours_: _Minutes_: _Seconds_ layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.

1. Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.

1. The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click _X_, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF**

1. **Importing**

The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.

## **2\.** **Customization of Pictures**

Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.

Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-15.jpg)

### In the “Effects” menu, you can choose among popular options – Original, Vintage, Marcato, and B&W. After you make your choice, you can set the bars for Saturation, Hue, Exposure, Contrast, and Brightness. These are much like you would find in your standard photo apps

Hit the play button to test your GIF, and if it’s to your liking, click “Create GIF”. It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.

1. **Customization of Videos**

There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99\. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Giphy Capture**

#### 1\. Once you’ve opened GIPHY Capture - open up your browser, video, or whatever you want to record. Adjust the size of your GIPHY capture frame by grabbing any of the sides or corners and stretching to your desired frame size

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-9.jpg)

After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.

You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.

You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-10.jpg)

1. Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.

1. Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.

1. If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.

### **GIFROCKET**

**Supported OS:** Mac

GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you've downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.

The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.

**Features:**

* Intuitive interface
* Change quality and file size of the outputted file

**Cons:**

* Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket**

1. After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the _Settings_ button. Here you’ll get three fields.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg)

1. Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the _Hours_: _Minutes_: _Seconds_ layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.

1. Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.

1. The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click _X_, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Giphy Capture**

#### 1\. Once you’ve opened GIPHY Capture - open up your browser, video, or whatever you want to record. Adjust the size of your GIPHY capture frame by grabbing any of the sides or corners and stretching to your desired frame size

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-9.jpg)

After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.

You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.

You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-10.jpg)

1. Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.

1. Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.

1. If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.

### **GIFROCKET**

**Supported OS:** Mac

GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you've downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.

The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.

**Features:**

* Intuitive interface
* Change quality and file size of the outputted file

**Cons:**

* Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket**

1. After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the _Settings_ button. Here you’ll get three fields.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg)

1. Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the _Hours_: _Minutes_: _Seconds_ layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.

1. Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.

1. The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click _X_, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.

**BEST PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC**

### **PICGIF**

**Supported OS:** Mac

PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps' commonly crappy and blurry gifs.

You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It's a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.

### **Features:**

* Support a vast number of file formats
* Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.
* Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.
* Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.

**Pros:**

* The PicGIF software is safe to use
* The support of PicGIF is good

**Cons:**

* Requires OS X 10.7 Lion or later

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF**

1. **Importing**

The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-13.jpg)

## **2\.** **Customization of Pictures**

Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.

Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-14.jpg)

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-15.jpg)

### In the “Effects” menu, you can choose among popular options – Original, Vintage, Marcato, and B&W. After you make your choice, you can set the bars for Saturation, Hue, Exposure, Contrast, and Brightness. These are much like you would find in your standard photo apps

Hit the play button to test your GIF, and if it’s to your liking, click “Create GIF”. It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.

1. **Customization of Videos**

There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99\. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-16.jpg)

### **GIFROCKET**

**Supported OS:** Mac

GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you've downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.

The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.

**Features:**

* Intuitive interface
* Change quality and file size of the outputted file

**Cons:**

* Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket**

1. After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the _Settings_ button. Here you’ll get three fields.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg)

1. Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the _Hours_: _Minutes_: _Seconds_ layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.

1. Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.

1. The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click _X_, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.

**BEST PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC**

### **PICGIF**

**Supported OS:** Mac

PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps' commonly crappy and blurry gifs.

You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It's a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.

### **Features:**

* Support a vast number of file formats
* Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.
* Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.
* Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.

**Pros:**

* The PicGIF software is safe to use
* The support of PicGIF is good

**Cons:**

* Requires OS X 10.7 Lion or later

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF**

1. **Importing**

The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-13.jpg)

## **2\.** **Customization of Pictures**

Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.

Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-14.jpg)

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-15.jpg)

### In the “Effects” menu, you can choose among popular options – Original, Vintage, Marcato, and B&W. After you make your choice, you can set the bars for Saturation, Hue, Exposure, Contrast, and Brightness. These are much like you would find in your standard photo apps

Hit the play button to test your GIF, and if it’s to your liking, click “Create GIF”. It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.

1. **Customization of Videos**

There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99\. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-16.jpg)

**GIFABLE**

**Supported OS:** Mac

### Gifable is another macOS application that enables user to create GIFs as well as save the display screen. This software is simple to use. It first takes a screenshot of the display and converts it to GIF format. This tool currently transmits data at a rate of 12 frames per second.

This device is ideal for blogging, tutorials, sharing with colleagues, and social media

**Features:**

* Shows a preview of the gif when the recording is finished
* Ability to copy the gif to your clipboard for easy copy and paste

### **Pros:**

* Click and drag to record
* Records automatically

### **Cons:**

* Not compatible with all operating systems
* Low fps recording

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Gifable**

**Pros:**

* It is vastly easy to use compared to many other apps in the market.
* It comes with the most dynamic interface.

**Cons:**

* File sizes of the produced GIFs are big in some cases, which leads to a slow upload on websites with huge traffic.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Gifox**

### 1\. **Record Your Screen**

After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-20.jpg)

Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.

For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-21.jpg)

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-22.jpg)

When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.

Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-23.jpg)

### **2\.** **Flexible Setting**

Gifox is not only easy to use but also a very flexible application. Here are just some of the options that you can customize:

* Mouse cursor appearance
* Window shadow
* Desktop background recording fps
* Playback fps
* Repeat count and pause
* Max colors
* Bayer scale

All of these are available in the Gifox settings window.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-24.jpg)

### 3\. **Compress**

If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF. You can change the color count, the palette, the dither, and the bayer scale. This eliminates the need to install a second program just for compressing your file.

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC?**

If the main reason you want this powerful and advanced GIF software is to create GIFs from videos, you should invest in the advanced version. Since there is not much you can do with videos and the free version.

However, if you want to make GIFs from photos, this free or open-source version will suffice.

**FAQS ABOUT MAKING GIFS FROM VIDEO**

1. **What tip can I have in editing GIFs?**

You don't need to make your GIF colorful. You need to use fewer colors. The fewer colors your GIF has, the more fun it is. Because if your GIF has a lot of colors, you will have a problem exporting it.

1. **Is it possible to export GIFs without watermarks?**

Yes, some GIF editors have a feature to remove the watermarks using a free account. However, there are also GIF editors where you need to pay a flat amount first before exporting GIF without watermarks.

1. **Can I use Video Converter Ultimate offline to edit a GIF?**

Absolutely, yes. Even without internet access, you can modify and quickly convert your GIF in no time.

## **Conclusion:**

If the proper GIF editor is used, animated GIFs can be edited with little effort. There are GIF software programs that are highly recommended by users due to their ease of use and simple interface. It's time to give them a shot!

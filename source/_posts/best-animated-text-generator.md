## Best 8 Online GIF to APNG Converters

##### Great Video Converter - Wondershare Filmora

Provide abundant video effects - A creative video editor

Powerful color correction and grading

Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

Let's look at the top 8 best **GIFs to APNG converters** now.

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG ).

**Step 5: Compress**

The compression rate is set to "Best" by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.

![Compressed](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-21_16h58_41.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\.

Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

## **2 Ways to Resize FLV Videos on Android**

Wouldn’t it be great if you could resize FLV videos on your android device rather than having to open your computer for every small task? Previously, this was a major issue due to a lack of good video editors for android with flv support but that’s no longer the case. Below are two ways to resize FLV videos on android:

1. **Inshot**

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-31.jpg)

InShot is a powerful all-in-one video editor for android which acts both as a basic video editor as well as an advanced video editor with its simple design yet powerful features. There aren’t many video editors in Android that supports Flv or some older codecs, but InShot is one of the very few editors that support these video formats. It is a paid app but also has a limited free version to try.

**Steps to resize FLV videos on Android with InShot:**

* Open the Inshot app on your android device and click on **Video**.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-32.jpg)

* Now select the FLV video file and click on the tick icon near the bottom right.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-33.jpg)

* Then tap on the **Crop** option from the tools at the bottom.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-34.jpg)

* Now select the aspect ratio you like and crop accordingly.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-35.jpg)

* To save the video, tap on the **Save** button at the top right. Then choose the resolution and finally save the video to your device.

## Detailed Tutorial to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player

Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?

Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.

One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

**Technique one:**

## An Easier Way to Merge Videos in A Few Clicks

It's true that merging videos in VLC Media Player takes quite a few steps, so to speak. But is this the only editing program in which a similar operation can be performed? Of course not. Therefore, in our article, we decided to offer you an alternative, where you can also easily merge the videos. This is the famous [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , a software that is one of the easiest and most convenient to work with, especially for those who want to edit videos without having much experience in "complicated" software before. So again, [step by step guideline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elI5Fb8kBKQ) on how to put together our video clips in Wondershare Filmora.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-18.jpg)

* Accordingly, we can make one video "sit" next to another. If we want or need it, we will add the third video clip, fourth, and so on.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-19.jpg)

* We can view the entire video and save the video afterwards.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-20.jpg)

* In the opened window, on the left side, to be precise, if we observe well, we can already choose in which format we want to save our clip. On the right we can indicate what name we want to give to our video; The location where we want to store it; Also, we see the resolution (which we can modify freely after clicking on Settings); Size; Duration.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-21.jpg)

* In Settings, we can decide how much quality the video should have, how many kbps will be the Bit Rate, how many fps the Frame Rate should be, etc., but most likely, beginners will not need to change all this.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-22.jpg)

* After selecting everything, right-click on the Export button in the lower right corner of the window and the program will start saving the material.

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## 3 Ways to Make Time-Lapse Video on MacBook

The process of time-lapse speeds up the passage of time so that events seem to be happening faster. A time-lapse video is to create photos at regular intervals and assemble them into the video to record changes that would be slow for the human eye to see. Time-Lapse video shows the technique of slow-motion videos using the same principle.

Time-lapse is usually for several purposes but mostly it is utilized to show the passage of time in a fast-forward format. time-lapse means that the camera takes the picture and then combined them into one video that seems to something happen in quickly. The lapse is set into video form in post-production, so movie mode is not necessary. Once the lapse is finished, it's time to take it into post-production to bring it to life.

## Part 1\. Use QuickTime Player to Create Timelapse Video

QuickTime player creates a high-resolution video file from the series of photos without having to render the photos twice. The result of QuickTime is a much higher quality result. With this toolkit, after the recording is done, the illusion of fast-moving footage i-e time-lapse is to be created. QuickTime will always ask you what frame rate would you like to video in.

**Steps to Create Timelapse Video with QuickTime Player:**

To produce a timelapse movie using QuickTime Player, follow these steps:

Step 1: Launch the Recording

By selecting the File \* New Screen Recording option in QuickTime, you may record your screen. After choosing the region to record, your screen will start to be recorded. Real-time video will be captured, and it will be archived.

![quicktime new recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-recording.jpg)

Step 2: Import the Files

Go to the file > Open Image Sequence menu after starting QuickTime. One of the video files you want to turn into a time-lapse should be opened in QuickTime Player. “Open File.” may be found by clicking the File menu link in the menu bar.

Step 3: Create the Timelapse

Within QuickTime, the series of images will be turned into time-lapse films. Choose one picture from the series, and then change the settings as necessary. Use the Higher Quality Apple Pro Resolution video codec, Actual size resolution, and 25 frames per second.

![create timelapse quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-timelapse-video-quicktime.jpg)

Step 4: Export Your Video

Finally, you may access the Speed option by selecting Tools>Edit from the top menu's Imported section. At the conclusion, this will produce your time-lapse, and then choose Save under File. This will open a window where you can choose the codec you want to export it in.

![save videos quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-player-save-videos.jpg)

## Part 2\. Create Timelapse Video with iMovie

To make an iMovie time-lapse on Mac, you have to capture the video and create a time-lapse out of it. For a multiple-hour recording in a few seconds to be fit, you will need software of time-lapse. Timelapse is utilized for accelerated or slow-motion videos with changes in the frame rate and playback videos in speed. The time-lapse software is available to handle the tasks without sacrificing the quality, size, and format of the video.

**Steps To Create Timelapse Video with iMovie**

Step 1: Launch iMovie

On your Mac, launch the iMovie application, and then import the video clip from the library that you wish to use to create a time-lapse. Drag the video to the timeline. Then you may see additional frames in the timeline by clicking the setting bar below.

![launch imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-imovie-application-on-mac.jpg)

Step 2: Import videos and adjust

By clicking the icon that resembles a camera below the Viewer panel, drag images into the project library. Drag the desired images to the Project Library. By choosing File and then selecting Project Properties, you may modify the default settings. Set the first picture location to Fit Frame and the transition length to 1 second.

![import videos to imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-adjust-video-imovie-mac.jpg)

Step 3: Modify the Clips' Speed

Select it if you wish to alter the clip's pace. On the preview window's top toolbar, tap the clock symbol. You may pick "8x" for the default frame rate or "20x" for "Speed" > "Fast." In iMovie, the minimum time is 0.1 seconds or around 10 frames. As a result, you must first export the time-lapse sequence before speeding up the clip.

![modify video speed imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/modify-video-speed-imovie-mac.jpg)

Step 4: Share the Video

Using the Share option at the bottom, you can then save, export, or share your slowed-down time-lapse film. Refer to the "Share" option to decide whether to store or immediately share the iMovie time-lapse.

![share video on imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-the-video-imovie-mac.jpg)

## Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video

The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don't need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.

Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you're on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don't have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we've put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you'll need to know to make stunning films, even if you've never done it before. We'll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.

## **Part 1\. Edit Recorded Video in OBS**

OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It's open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.

**Step 1\. Download and Install OBS**

Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.

**Step 2\. Setup Screen Recording**

The window is divided into separate parts called "docks" when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you'll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.

![obs setup screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg)

You'll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).

**Step 3\. Customize the Recording Source**

You'll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select "Display Capture" by clicking the "+" icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click "OK". At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.

![obs customize the recording source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg)

**Step 4\. Start/Stop Recording**

You'll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you're ready to begin recording. When you're finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.

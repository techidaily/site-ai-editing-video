Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.

**Alignment**

Don't underestimate the importance of alignment in **Lightroom collage**. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.

In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.

**Proximity**

Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:

**●** Realistic pictures should be put together.

**●** Unrelatable images should be separated.

Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.

**Theme**

The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it's not as measurable as others.

**Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout**

If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It's pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn't seem pleasing to your eyes.

## How Do You Find a High-Quality Video Marketing Company?

It is difficult to spot a high-quality agency because most promise a lot but deliver very little. With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.

##### Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective

Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.

##### Step 2 Assess Overall Quality

On your journey of finding video marketing companies, you will come across many agencies that will look very promising, apparently. But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.

![assess overall quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_2.jpg)

##### Step 3 Give Priority to Experience

Selecting a marketing video agency without past experience with companies in your industry will be a blunder. This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.

![give priority to experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_3.jpg)

##### Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials

Checking out the reviews of past clients and customers is an essential part of selection. Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.

![check customer testimonials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_4.jpg)

##### Step 5 Watch out for Creativity

Creativity differentiates between excellence and average in the video marketing world. Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.

Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency's creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.

![watch out for creativity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_5.jpg)

##### Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously

Creative video content is useless if it cannot reach the most targeted audiences. The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a **marketing video agency** near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.

Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.

![take optimization seriously](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_6.jpeg)

##### Step 7 Dive Into the Process

You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.

Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.

![dive into the process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_7.jpeg)

##### Step 8 Focus on Communication

Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the **video marketing company**. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.

Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.

![focus on communication](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_8.jpg)

##### Step 9 Request a Proposal

You must have shortlisted a few high-quality video marketing companies following the steps mentioned so far. It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.

You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.

![request a proposal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_9.jpg)

##### Step 10 Evaluate Return on Investment

Last but not least, you should compare the prices to evaluate which proposals offer more value for your money. You should also calculate your return on investment so that your investment brings in the expected results without damaging you monetarily. You will also get to know the hidden charges and deliveries, and you should consider an agency that mentions them upfront for transparency. Finally, trust your assessment and instinct and select the best promotional video production company to take your business to the next level.

You need to figure out what your video is about and what you want to convey to the audience. It involves a concept or theme for the video, research, and reference material. You can also explore different ideas to make your video unique and engaging.

![graphical text of initial ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-initial-ideas.jpg)

##### Step1Research and gather information

You can begin by researching and gathering information from other music videos. This will help you to know what has been done before and what is currently popular. You can also figure out how you can do it differently.

##### Step2Brainstorm and concept development

Once you understand the current trends and styles in the music video. It's time to start brainstorming ideas. You can do it alone or with the help of your team. But remember that you have to think out of the box to make it creative.

##### Step3Consider the lyrics and message

In the planning stage, it is also important to consider the lyrics and message of the song. It would be best if you plan according to the feel and vibe of the song. It will help you to create a concept tied to the song and will help enhance its meaning.

##### Step4Experiment and find the right direction

Once you have a general concept, it's time to develop it further. You can do it by creating rough sketches or storyboards. You can also film test footage to see how the concept will look on screen.

##### Step5Effort and attention to detail

Remember, this step is the foundation of your music video. So, take your time and don't rush through it. By putting in effort and attention to detail, you'll be able to create a visually stunning and closely tied to the song's music video.

## Choose a style for your music video

While creating ideas for the music video, it's also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:

![types of music video style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/types-of-music-video-style.jpg)

### 1.Performance-style music video

If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.

### 2.Narrative-style music video

A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.

You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.

Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.

![treatment of the plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/treatment-of-the-plan.jpg)

## Storyboard your music video

Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding! It allows you to break down your music video visually and highlight key visual moments. It can save time and money and convey a clear idea to the team. You can do this on paper, a computer, or a tablet, whatever works best for you.

Step 1

Visit _filmora.wondershare.com_ and download the [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Hit Install. When it’s done installing, the app will start automatically. When it does, click on **New Project.**

Step 2

Before we start editing, go to **File** from the navigation panel at the top and select **Project Settings.** Then, set the resolution settings like in the example here.

![project settings filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/project-settings-filmora.png)

Step 3

Now, download any background image you want. Make sure its resolution is 1920x1080\. Import it and drag it to the Timeline.

Step 4

From the Timeline, double-click on the Background clip and decrease its opacity to 70%. Then, click on **Color** from the upper-left corner and change the settings as you wish.

![color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-settings.png)

Step 5

Go to the **Titles** tab and drag the **Default Title** to the Timeline. Double-click on the Default Title clip and change fonts, type in your text, etc.

![default title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/default-title-filmora.png)

Step 6

Drag the text to enlarge it so it fits the entire screen. Then, change its color to green. Press **OK.** Now, Export this clip and name it “1st Text”.

![change text color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-text-color.png)

Step 7

Now, open a new Filmora project and edit the Project Settings like we did before. Then, go to **Sample** **Color** and drag the white color to the Timeline.

![sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/sample-color.png)

Step 8

Drag the Playhead to the 2-second marker. Drag the same Background image as before to this point. Then, double-click on the Background clip and increase the Brightness and Saturation bars to **50\.** Click **OK.**

![drag image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-image.png)

Step 9

Go to **Transitions** and type in “Push”. Drag the **Push** transition between the White layer and your Background image. Click on **Export** once again and name this clip “Transition”.

![push transition filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/push-transition-filmora.png)

Step 10

Open a new Filmora project and adjust the Project Settings like we did the first time. Then, go to **Sample Color** and drag the White color to the Timeline once more.

Step 11

Go to **Titles** and drag the Default Title to the Timeline, above the White Sample Color clip. Now, double-click the Default Title clip and go to **ADVANCED.** Here, set the text color to green, choose a font you like, and increase the text size. Click **OK.** Export it and name it “Temporary”.

![edit text in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-text-in-filmora.png)

Step 12

Open a new project in Filmora. Import and Drag the same background image you used before to the Timeline. Double-click on it and drag the Saturation bar to **\-100**. Now, drag the file you named “Temporary” into the Timeline.

![drag file into timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-file-into-timeline.png)

Step 13

Double-click on the Temporary clip, scroll down when the new window appears, and find the **Chroma key** section. Enable this. Now, drag the Edge Feather bar to **0\.** Export this video and name it “2nd Text”.

![green screen in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/green-screen-in-filmora.png)

Step 14

Open one more new project in Filmora and import the following files. There should be four, titled “Background”, “Transition”, “1st Text”, and “2nd Text”.

Step 15

Click on **Sample Color** and drag the **Black** color to the 1st Track of the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag the “**Transition**” clip to the same Track within the Timeline.

![transition clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/transition-clip.png)

Step 16

From the **Transitions** tab, select the **Push** transition and drag it to the Timeline.

![add transition in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-transition-in-filmora.png)

Step 17

Set the Playhead at the 1-second marker once again. First, add the “1st Text” clip into Track 2 of the Timeline. Then, add another **Push** transition at the beginning of this clip.

![add clip in timeline filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-clip-in-timeline-filmora.png)

Step 18

Now, double-click on the “1st Text” clip and enable the **Chroma Key** option. Then, set the **Edge Thickness** and **Edge Feather** bars to **0.**

![edit chroma key options filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-chroma-key-options-filmora.png)

Step 19

Set the Playhead at 4.5 seconds. Snip the Timeline. Then, add a new Default Title on the right side of the Playhead on Track 2.

![insert new title in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/insert-new-title-in-filmora.png)

Step 20

Double-click on the Default Title and go to Advanced settings. From there, delete the default text and click on the highlighted button like in the image below to add a new background to this clip. Add the same background you’ve used throughout the entire video.

![add background to title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-background-to-title-filmora.png)

Step 21

Add a new text here and customize it to match the text style in your “2nd Text” clip you exported earlier. Click **OK**.

![add text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text.png)

Step 22

Next, go to the Transitions tab and drag the **“Row Split”** transition clip between Track 2 and the New Default Title you just created. Then, double-click on the transition and change its duration to 1 second.

![row split transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/row-split-transition.png)

## Part 1: What is the Adjustment Layer in After Effects?

The adjustment layer can save you time and energy from adding effects to multiple clips individually. It does not alter the composition of your video clip until you start applying the effects. Once you add the effect in the adjustment layer, it will replace the effect on all the layers under it.

You can add the adjustment layers in your timeline for creating visual effects such as film grain or color grading. Using the adjustment layer, you can produce transition effects by adding effects to shorter compositions. However, if you want to use the adjustment layer properly, you should select its position carefully in the layer’s stack.

Moreover, always keep in mind that anything placed under the adjustment layer will have a direct effect. In contrast, anything above the adjustment layer won’t get affected.

### 01Identify the audience

Before creating a slideshow, you first need to ascertain who is your target audience. The slideshow can be created for your friends, family, relatives, or YouTube or social media platform viewers. Depending on the target audience, the content and other slideshow elements will vary.

### 02Choose a travel story

Next, you need to decide upon the story of your travel slideshow. Depending on the story, you can pick up the content to be included. The story can be based on the places you visited, food, local shopping, and others. Also draft a story that has an introduction, a middle part, and an end.

### 03Sort the pictures and videos

Next comes the trickiest part of selecting the pictures and videos to be added to the slideshow. For any trip, there are hundreds of images but you cannot add them all to your slideshow.

Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let's look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.

**Step 2: Trim to shorten the video**

Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!

To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.

**Step 3: Export as GIF**

Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.

![export mov to gif in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-11.jpg)

![change timelapse on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-time-lapse-on-iphone.jpg)

* There are multiple ways and applications to convert timelapse videos to normal ones on iPhone. But the safest and most effective way to do that is by using iMovie.

* When iMovie is successfully installed on your iPhone, open the application and allow all the permissions that it asks for. Then click on the "+" icon in the middle of your screen to create a new project. If you want you can name your project when its created.
* After opening your new project, you can tap on the "Import" option to add media files to the interface. Here it will open your files from which you will need to select the timelapse video that you want to edit. Click on it and it will be automatically added to iMovie.
* You can also add multiple timelapse videos if you want to convert them all and merge them into one file. Then on the iMovie interface, there will be a timeline available at the bottom of your screen. You can adjust it to trim, replace or rearrange the clips.
* Then on the bottom left corner of your screen, you will see a "speed" icon which is generally the second tool on the interface. Click on it and it will open the playback speed controls for you. Adjusting and dragging on the speed control, you will be able to change the playback speed of the timelapse.
* You will need to slow down the playback speed by toggling the speed controls. Set it to a speed lower than 1X which can make it look like a normal video. When you are done, click on the tick mark to save the changes.
* Now preview the video and make sure you are satisfied with the conversion. Then go to settings, and customize the video output settings as well as quality. When you are done with these changes, click on the "Export" option to save the video to your device or share it on any platform.

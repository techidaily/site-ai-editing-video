## How to Make Vintage Film Effect 1950S

So, what's the difference between a vintage film shot in the 1920s and 1950s? It's simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let's learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.

## Preparation

![1950 vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1950-vintage-scene.gif)

Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn't need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It's even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent's collection.

How to create a 1950s vintage film:

##### Step 1 Add your video on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![add your video on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-1.jpg)

First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.

##### Step 2 Apply a cropping effect to the video

![apply a cropping effect to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-2.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and choose the **Crop** effect under the **Utility** folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.

![click the effect tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-3.jpg)

Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.

##### Step 3 Add a Warm Film color effect

![add a warm film color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-4.jpg)

Up to here, you'll realize that your video doesn't still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the **3D LUT** option under the **Color** category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose **Warm Film**. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.

##### Step 4 Apply more graininess to the film

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Please don't stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the **Overlay** menu under the Effects tab, then click **Old Film**. After that, choose the **Random Dust, Dirty Film,** and **Subtle Grain** effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.

The fade in or fade out effect for video clips look similar to fade text Premiere Pro. In fact, you can use the steps of how to fade in text in Premiere Pro to get the job done. But there is an easier way available with Video Transitions option. Here are the steps on how to apply fade in or out effect on your video clips in Premiere Pro.

Step1 You should have multiple video clips added to Timeline. Select the video clip to which you want to apply Fade in effect.

Step2 Go to Effects panel and click on Video Transitions option.

![click video transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-video-transitions-pr.jpg)

Step3 Click on Dissolve and from the dropdown list, drag and drop Film Dissolve to the beginning of the selected video clip for fade in effect.

![drag film dissolve pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-film-dissolve-pr.jpg)

Step4 Click on the added effect on Timeline to adjust speed, duration, and alignment of the effect.

![adjust effects control pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjust-effects-control-pr.jpg)

Step5 Play the video to ensure that the effect looks perfect. Therefore, go to File> Share> Export File to save the video.

You can place the transition at the end of the video for fading out effect. Instead of Film Dissolve, you can use Crossfade or Dip to Black effect for fade in and fade out effect on video clips.

## How to Zoom In and Out on Mac

Having difficulties seeing the small print on your Mac's screen? You can easily enlarge the whole screen with just a few clicks with this guide of how-to un-zoom on mac; which is useful for anybody with poor vision in particular. Users of the macOS operating system may zoom in and out on tiny, difficult-to-read text and pictures in a variety of ways. Would you want to interact closely with anything on your Mac? Maybe you'd like to see things from a broader angle so you would require a **how to zoom out on Mac** tutorial.

In any case, you have our support. There are various ways to zoom in and out on a Mac, whether you want to do it for the whole screen or just a specific window. For your benefit, we went through many different methods to zoom out on a Mac today. Apple provides a wide range of customizing possibilities. We'll provide you practical advice on how to utilize your keyboard, mouse, trackpad, or browser to zoom in MacBook. Let's get started straight now without further ado.

## Way 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts

When using an app, holding down Command key while using the plus (+) or minus (-) keys will allow you to zoom in or out as needed. Using the keyboard on your Mac, you may zoom in and out at intervals of 10%; when you do, a pop-up menu with the option to reset (i.e., return to the default, or 100%, zoom level) will display at the top of the screen. Instead of touching or repeating the shortcut, just keep holding the plus or minus key to zoom farther. Accessibility Zoom, which was created as a tool for the blind and enables you to zoom in on a Mac to see tiny text and precisely change settings with checkboxes, must be enabled if you wish to zoom in on the whole screen rather than just an app window (such as Utilities).

### Steps to Use Keyboard Shortcut to Zoom in MacBook

Step1Go to Accessibility > System Preferences > Zoom, then click Zoom in the sidebar. Check the check next to "Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom" after that. Click the command key (located on either side of the space bar).

![how to zoom in/out on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-zoom-from-accessibility.jpg)

Step2Press the plus/equal sign ("+ =") button, which is adjacent to the delete button on the top right side of the keyboard, while continuing to hold down the command button to zoom in.

Step3Press the dash/underscore button ("- \_"), which is situated next to the "+ =" button on the top right side of the keyboard, while still holding down the command button, to zoom out.

## Way 2: Use Trackpad Gestures

You may quickly learn how to zoom in on a Mac using trackpad movements if you prefer using a touchpad versus learning any kind of keyboard shortcuts. With a MacBook, there is another, maybe simpler way to zoom in and out in addition to the approach mentioned above. If your keyboard isn't entirely working, it may still be helpful. However, make sure that gesture support is turned on in the settings on your Mac. Although a Mac still supports the usage of a mouse, new Mac software is designed to be used with a trackpad. Apple is abandoning the mouse. And with a little practice, you can do it too. What you must do is as follows:

### Steps to Enable Trackpad Gestures

Step1Open System Preferences and choose Trackpad. Next, choose the Scroll & Zoom tab and select the "Smart zoom" checkbox. Zooming in on web sites, photos, and documents couldn't be much simpler after gesture support was set up:

![how to zoom in/out on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/trackpad-scroll-zoom.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step2You can zoom in or out on Mac by placing two fingers on the touchpad and moving one finger closer to the other or further apart (repeat for additional zooming)

Step3Another option is to simply zoom in and out by double-tapping the touchpad with two fingers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Way 3: Use Scroll Gesture

If you'd like to use your mouse, you may utilize the screen zoom option, which enlarges everything on your screen rather than just the app window you're now viewing. This would need holding down one of the designated modifier keys while scrolling in order to zoom in on a Mac. Just like on an iPhone or iPad, you can zoom in and out by pinching and un-pinching. The smart zoom motion, on the other hand, is executed by double-tapping with two fingers. This immediately zooms into or immediately zooms out of a web page or pdf.

### Steps to Enable Scroll Gesture

Step1To make this feature active, from the Apple menu, choose System Preferences and select Accessibility. Choose Zoom from the sidebar.

Step2Select "Use scroll motion with modifier keys to zoom" from the drop-down menu as shown above.

## Way 4: Enable Hover Text to Zoom

Use the wonderful assistive feature called Hover Text to enlarge a single macOS user interface piece without zooming out the whole Mac screen. One of your alternatives is to enable zooming while hovering over text. The "Enable Hover Text" option is part of the Zoom menu but does not directly magnify the display. The function allows users to use the Command key to momentarily enlarge just the text below the pointer and is accessible without Zoom having to be activated. When Hover Text is enabled on your Mac, you may drag the cursor over anything on the screen, such as text, input fields, menu items, or buttons, and a high-resolution magnified version of those objects will appear in a new window. Find out here how to make Hover Text available on your Mac:

### Steps to Use Hover Text to Zoom

Step1When you choose this option, a larger, higher-resolution picture of the text your cursor is over will show as long as you press and hold down the "Command" key. Click "Options" to modify the text's appearance.

![how to zoom in/out on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-hover-text-to-zoom.jpg)

Step2Additional customization options are available in the Options menu, including the ability to alter the font, the size of the zoomed-in text (which may range from 14pt to 128pt), the font's appearance surrounding the cursor, and the modifier key that activates the function.

## Way 5: Enable Touch Bar

This substitute is only accessible on Macs equipped with Touch Bars. A handy feature is the Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is a feature on every current MacBook Pro model, including the 13-inch and 16-inch versions. On the Touch Bar, there is a mix of App Controls and a Control Strip. To use with your compatible MacBook Pro, the Touch Bar has additional features. Although it is helpful right out of the box, some customization may be required for your advantage. Fortunately, Apple makes modifications rather straightforward. You may change your default by following the instructions below.

### Steps to Enable Touch Bar on MacBook

Step1The Touch Bar at the bottom of your display will grow and become easier to view if you choose the "Enable Touch Bar zoom" option. Now all you have to do is touch and hold the Touch Bar to test it out.

Step2Click the Apple symbol in the upper left corner of your screen and choose "System Preferences" to activate the touch bar in another method.

Step3Select "Keyboard" > "Keyboard" and then select "Touch Bar shows" under the Touch Bar settings. Then choose an option from the menu, which also includes the larger Control Strip and app buttons.

Step2You can zoom in or out on Mac by placing two fingers on the touchpad and moving one finger closer to the other or further apart (repeat for additional zooming)

Step3Another option is to simply zoom in and out by double-tapping the touchpad with two fingers.

## Way 3: Use Scroll Gesture

If you'd like to use your mouse, you may utilize the screen zoom option, which enlarges everything on your screen rather than just the app window you're now viewing. This would need holding down one of the designated modifier keys while scrolling in order to zoom in on a Mac. Just like on an iPhone or iPad, you can zoom in and out by pinching and un-pinching. The smart zoom motion, on the other hand, is executed by double-tapping with two fingers. This immediately zooms into or immediately zooms out of a web page or pdf.

### Steps to Enable Scroll Gesture

Step1To make this feature active, from the Apple menu, choose System Preferences and select Accessibility. Choose Zoom from the sidebar.

Step2Select "Use scroll motion with modifier keys to zoom" from the drop-down menu as shown above.

Step3Select the desired modifier key from the dropdown menu.

## Way 4: Enable Hover Text to Zoom

Use the wonderful assistive feature called Hover Text to enlarge a single macOS user interface piece without zooming out the whole Mac screen. One of your alternatives is to enable zooming while hovering over text. The "Enable Hover Text" option is part of the Zoom menu but does not directly magnify the display. The function allows users to use the Command key to momentarily enlarge just the text below the pointer and is accessible without Zoom having to be activated. When Hover Text is enabled on your Mac, you may drag the cursor over anything on the screen, such as text, input fields, menu items, or buttons, and a high-resolution magnified version of those objects will appear in a new window. Find out here how to make Hover Text available on your Mac:

### Steps to Use Hover Text to Zoom

Step1When you choose this option, a larger, higher-resolution picture of the text your cursor is over will show as long as you press and hold down the "Command" key. Click "Options" to modify the text's appearance.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step2Additional customization options are available in the Options menu, including the ability to alter the font, the size of the zoomed-in text (which may range from 14pt to 128pt), the font's appearance surrounding the cursor, and the modifier key that activates the function.

## Way 5: Enable Touch Bar

This substitute is only accessible on Macs equipped with Touch Bars. A handy feature is the Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is a feature on every current MacBook Pro model, including the 13-inch and 16-inch versions. On the Touch Bar, there is a mix of App Controls and a Control Strip. To use with your compatible MacBook Pro, the Touch Bar has additional features. Although it is helpful right out of the box, some customization may be required for your advantage. Fortunately, Apple makes modifications rather straightforward. You may change your default by following the instructions below.

### Steps to Enable Touch Bar on MacBook

Step1The Touch Bar at the bottom of your display will grow and become easier to view if you choose the "Enable Touch Bar zoom" option. Now all you have to do is touch and hold the Touch Bar to test it out.

Step2Click the Apple symbol in the upper left corner of your screen and choose "System Preferences" to activate the touch bar in another method.

Step3Select "Keyboard" > "Keyboard" and then select "Touch Bar shows" under the Touch Bar settings. Then choose an option from the menu, which also includes the larger Control Strip and app buttons.

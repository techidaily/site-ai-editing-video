## Part 1: What Does a Video with a Slow Playback Mean?

[**Premiere Pro Playback Slow**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a common issue faced by editors these days. It refers to playback slowness and choppiness of a fresh or edited video. Many users report a complete blackout in video footage during the playback. Lagging in playback might result from insufficient RAM or inadequate storage space. Maybe an outdated GPU, heavy video effects, or active background programs cause it.

Such playback lagging can prove incredibly frustrating or test your patience beyond limits. It can desync the audio and video components of files during the playback. You can consider it a sign that your computer does not have the right specs for [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html). Also, it could mean that this tool is dropping frames in the Playback of videos.

## Part 2: Fixing the Premiere Pro Slow Playback Issue \[100% Effective Solutions\]

If your Premiere Pro is not smoothly playing the videos, this section is for you. Firstly, you should confirm that your playback is lagging or slowing down. To do so, analyze whether your playhead is making small jumps or playing smoothly. There are plenty of things that you can do to reduce or minimize the **Premiere playback slow**.

* [Solution 1: Disable High-Quality Playback](#solution1)
* [Solution 2: Delete Media Cache Files](#solution2)
* [Solution 3: Optimize Rendering for Performance](#solution3)
* [Solution 4: Close Unnecessary Applications](#solution4)
* [Solution 5: Turn on GPU Acceleration](#solution5)
* [Solution 6: Change Playback Resolution](#solution5)
* [Solution 7: Use Proxy Videos in Adobe](#solution5)
* [Solution 8: Mute FX Effects](#solution5)

### Solution 1: Disable High-Quality Playback

Adobe Premiere Pro enables a High-Quality playback option by default. It helps in watching videos clearly but causes trouble. Thus, turning it off can fix the playback lagging. Tap on the "Settings" icon, which is next to the playback resolution menu. From there, disable the "High-Quality Playback" option by selecting it.

![disable high quality playback slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-1.jpg)

### Solution 2: Delete Media Cache Files

In Premiere Pro, the Media cache is a temporary storage space that keeps copies of files. It allows you to access the files faster and cause a good playback. If these media caches use hefty hard disk space, then to enhance playback performance.

To do so, open the Premiere Pro and go to the “Preferences” menu. From the list, select “Media Cache.” Now browse to select the media and tap on the “Delete Unused” next to the “Delete Unused Media Cache Files. After choosing the option to delete cache files, click on “OK and the files will be removed.

![delete media cache files slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-2.jpg)

### Solution 3: Optimize Rendering for Performance

If **Premiere Pro slow playback** still exists, then use this method to fix it. Set the optimized rendering to fix the performance of playback. Press the "Edit" option from the top toolbar and choose the "Preferences." Then, navigate toward "Memory" and find a pop-up window. From that screen, click on "Memory" dropdown and pick "Performance." Finally, tap on "OK" and get a better playback.

![optimize rendering for performance slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-3.jpg)

### Solution 4: Close Unnecessary Applications

Sometimes, lagging in playback occurs when you work on multiple applications. The system gets burdened and might slow down every process at that time. For a quick and effective solution, you should close the other tabs immediately. Only Adobe Premiere Pro and your file manager can remain open for continuous playback.

![close unnecessary applications, slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-4.jpg)

### Solution 5: Turn on GPU Acceleration

There is another fix you can try to overcome **Premiere Pro playback slow**. Without any delay, ensure that the Render is set to GPU Acceleration. Simply go to the “File” option at the top toolbar and click on the “Project Settings.” Then, pick “General” and set it to “Mercury Playback Engine GPU Acceleration.” This option is under the Playback Section and Video Render.

![turn on gpu acceleration slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-5.jpg)

### Solution 6: Change Playback Resolution

Due to the higher resolution of videos, playback lagging occurs. It has a quick solution: changing the playback resolution to a lower rate. For this purpose, go to "Settings" at the top right and choose the “Dynamic Quality” option. Select a lower resolution, like 1:2 or lower. You should look for options that can reduce resolution from the original resolution of the clip.

![change playback resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-6.jpg)

### Solution 7: Use Proxy Videos in Adobe

Proxy videos are proxy files that are compressed versions of original projects. They help users edit heavy and lengthy videos with any **Premiere Playback slow**. In your project panel, select your video and right-click on it. From the list, choose “Proxy” and explore “Create Proxies.”

Now, pick the "Codec" option from another window and tap "QuickTime." Specify a location for proxies and try to keep them in a new folder with the original media. Lastly, click "OK," and Adobe Media Encoder will instantly produce video proxies.

![use proxy videos slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-7.jpg)

### Solution 8: Mute FX Effects

The working size of video files gets increased with visual and audio effects. If your videos are still lagging in playbacks, then head to mute those effects to fix this issue. From the playback toolbar, choose the "fx" button. Alternatively, click on the "+" icon at the top right side of Program Monitor. Drag it to the button panel and press the “fx” button to toggle it “Off.”

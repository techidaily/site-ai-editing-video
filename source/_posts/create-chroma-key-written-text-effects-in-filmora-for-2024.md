## Create Chroma Key Written Text Effects in Filmora

Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.

## Part 1\. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?

Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.

![chroma key text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png)

Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it's an easy way to make 3D motion videos.

To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:

## Part 2\. Filming Tips for Written Texts

To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.

### Tip 1\. A Pen and a White Paper

We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.

We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:

![purple color pen on white paper](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png)

It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it's more apparent during filming.

### Tip 2\. Different Color Paper

There are many chances that you don't have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don't need to worry because you can use different color papers too.

But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.

![different color paper with different markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don't use dull color pens with bright color paper.

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

### Tip 4\. Larger Size of Letters

As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

![the larger size of the written key text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-5.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.

**●** **Reduced User Credibility**

The software reviews often report of unsatisfied users with an unreliable working experience. If that was not enough, some of the most trusted product review websites and long term users of the program have rendered the utility to be malicious.

**●** **Absence in Control Panel**

While all your system and application software can be found on the Control Panel and Windows listings, the aforesaid slideshow creator program is an exception. This leads to the unavailability of troubleshooting methods and settings adjustments, in case the program encounters a problem while running.

**●** **Incomplete Removal**

One of the biggest glitches with the software is that you possibly can never uninstall it completely, because some of the latter’s associated processes and software file traces tend to remain forever on your system, causing interference with the working of other programs.

**●** **Never-ending Uninstallation Process**

While you may opt to take the program out of your system to get rid of the inconvenience, that too is not an easy process to say the least. The uninstallation process once initiated does not seem to reach its end to what you can call ages!

### 02Uninstallation Inconsistencies of Aquasoft Slideshow Premium Software

Inconsistencies lie within the software itself, with its inbuilt uninstaller program refusing to work in cohesion with the assigned task. Sometimes it may refrain from opening up, while in other cases, the program comes to an unannounced run halt amid the uninstallation process.

**●** **Issues of File Processing**

The preset uninstallation package often fails to run or process a particular file which is necessary for uninstalling the program. The running process may often not initiate or stop midway, hence causing users enough discomfort to move towards getting rid of the program.

**●** **Processing Errors**

Often during the uninstallation process, you may encounter a series of processing errors leading to unsuccessful installation of most of the important files, which causes the leash over of partially deleted program files, barging your system’s memory with unusable data and irrelevant information.

**●** **Startup Prevention**

It may be a common instance to notice that the program refrains from being completely uninstalled due to some different program installed in your device. The allied program may interfere with the uninterrupted running of the Aquasoft uninstallation program.

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

![use luts in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/free-cinematic-luts-5.jpg)

### Step 3\. Access your LUT Library

![use luts in Filmora - access luts library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/free-cinematic-luts-6.jpg)

### Step 4\. Add your preferred LUT to your Project video

After clicking on "3D LUT," a drop-down list showing all the available LUTs will be displayed. Scroll and select your preferred LUT.

![use luts in Filmora - add luts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/free-cinematic-luts-7.jpg)

When you want to apply your LUTs in Filmora, click on "Load new LUT," which is still under "3D LUTs." You will be directed to your computer storage space to select the folder containing your LUTs.

After selecting your preferred LUT folder, hit the "OK" button to apply.

## Conclusion

**●** Worry no more when you have a small budget and a tight deadline for your project. Depending on your project's type, nature, and requirements, create bewildering footage using the above 15 LUTs. After applying your favorite LUT, carry out small basic adjustments such as the white balance, brightness, and contrast to your footage when necessary. By doing so, you are going to leave your clients and viewers ground rooted.

**●** A few of these free LUTs have a catch: watching the YouTube video and getting a password for unlocking their free LUT pack. The password is often displayed on the top-right corners of the YouTube videos.

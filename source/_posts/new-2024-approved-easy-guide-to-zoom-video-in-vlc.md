## Easy Guide to Zoom Video in VLC

Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.

You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.

## Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom

VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.

Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.

Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.

Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.

Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg)

Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg)

Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.

## Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu

Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.

Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.

Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-vlc-zoom-options.jpg)

Otherwise, you can press Shift + Z keys together to try out different zoom options.

## Part 3: Zoom VLC Video Using Magnifier

If you are using VLC Media Player on your Windows desktop computer, you can use the inbuilt Magnifier tool to zoom into a video that you are playing on VLC. You can zoom into videos to read any text in the background but this leads to low resolution and distortion. You can zoom in by 16 times which is the highest among all the three methods. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom video using Magnifier tool.

Step1Open VLC Player and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Start menu on Windows and search for “Magnifier”.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-vlc-video-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Click on Magnifier App. Once it opens, place the mouse pointer on the video and you will see its magnified version.

Step4Press Windows and “+” keys to zoom in while press Windows and “-“ keys to zoom out.

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video. It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:

![halloween bucket carving filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-9.jpg)

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. [Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/girl-blonde-portrait-halloween-43000089959.html)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. [An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/an-outdoor-table-with-halloween-theme-settings-43000100754.html)

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video?

Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it.

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video. It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. [Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/girl-blonde-portrait-halloween-43000089959.html)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. [An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/an-outdoor-table-with-halloween-theme-settings-43000100754.html)

After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

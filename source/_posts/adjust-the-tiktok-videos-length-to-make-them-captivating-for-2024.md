## Part 3\. The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video

Hope the above part will prove helpful to you in terms of adjusting the TikTok video using Wondershare Filmora. Now, let's see what the common reasons which hinder users from adjusting the length of TikTok Videos are:

### 1\. The Video is Too Short

Most TikTok users worry about **why they can't adjust TikTok clip length.** The common reason behind this query is the short length of the video. If your video length is 3 seconds, then it would not be possible to shorten it further on TikTok. Thus, try to make a Video of at least 15 seconds to upload it on TikTok successfully.

### 2\. The Video is Too Long

If you have recorded a too-long video, it would not be possible to adjust its length on TikTok. Too long videos, especially more than 10 minutes, are less likely to be modified by TikTok. For that, you can take the help of Filmora to adjust its size. Filmora will trim the video to a suitable length within seconds.

### 3\. Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects

Sometimes people use those effects in videos that are difficult to edit. For example, using a green screen creates some technical issues in your video, which gets weirder when you try to adjust the length of such a video. Due to this, proper adjustments in such videos are difficult to do on TikTok.

### 4\. App Glitch

As many people are engaged in using TikTok, so sometimes the app slows down. It becomes pretty difficult to adjust the length of TikTok videos when the app shows glitches. However, on Filmora, the case is totally the opposite. You will never face any difficulty, no matter how many users are using it.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-6.jpg)

The second part of this procedure is known by several titles in different versions of Windows 10's Photos app, such as creating a video with music, creating a film with text, and a new video project.

You want to start your video production after launching the Photos app. To do so, go to the top right corner of your screen and select New Video Project, which will take you to the editor mode.

The second part of this procedure is known by several titles in different versions of Windows 10's Photos app, such as creating a video with music, creating a film with text, and a new video project.

Launching the editor mode directly from the photo if you're using photos in your video project is also possible. In that case, consider the following:

* Open your file in the Photos app
* Select Edit & Create
* Select Create a movie with text from the drop-down menu.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-7.jpg)

## Conclusion

Stitching different scenes by video rotation has brought video editing to a new dimension altogether. Creating transitions in the videos has become easy more than ever. By adding effects in video editing, you can achieve your editing goals. Hence, you can have that "wow part of editing" without breaking a sweat. When the scenes with different directions are combined, they help in creating the subtle mood prompts for creating the desired flow. You can even adjust the angle of your video if you captured it at the wrong angle.

There are a variety of softwares in the digital world for this purpose. Davinci Resolve and Filmora Wondershare come with dynamic options for your post-production work. Owing to their versatility, these also have the feature of rotating your videos. Their user-friendly interface has made the entire experience of post-production work enjoyable.

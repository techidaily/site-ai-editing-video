## Part 1: What is SRT?

An SRT is one of the most common formats used in subtitling or captioning files. 'SRT' refers to a 'SubRip Subtitle' file, which originated from the DVD-ripping software by the same name. [SubRip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) would extract or rip subtitles and timings from live video, recorded video, and DVDs.

SRT has four major components:

1. A numeric counter indicates the number or position of the subtitle.
2. A Start and end time of the subtitle which is separated by the characters.
3. A Subtitle in one or more lines.
4. A blank line indicates the ending of the subtitle.

Now that you know about SRT let's understand why you should convert your Word file to SRT.

## Part 2: Why Should You Convert Word to SRT?

Most subtitles on the Internet are distributed in SRT format. Moreover, media players, lecture capture software, and video recording software are compatible with the SRT format.

Also, user frequently asks from forum like:

“I received a docx. file with subtitles already translated and the corresponding YouTube video URL. I was asked to proofread and then embed the subtitles into the video.”

To solve this, you can not only save it as a TXT document and change the file extension to .SRT, but also, a much easier way, convert subtitles from Microsoft Word files to SRT format through a easy-to-use SRT converter.

## Part 3: How to Convert a Word file to an SRT file without the software?

**Before we dive into the concrete steps guide, here are things we need to be considered:**

### Timestamp issue

Timestamps identify the exact point in an audio or video where the given text was spoken.

Now we know what a timestamp is and why it's important. Let's find out how to add timestamps in the SRT file.

**How to add timestamps**:

There are two ways to add timestamps in the file.

1. **Either add timestamps manually in the word document.**

To write timecodes, the format used is Hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds and milliseconds being rounded to 3 decimal places. Separate each timestamp with a two-hash arrow (written as - ->) and a blank line indicates the next caption sequence. After saving, these files are named with .srt extension.

1. **Or edit the SRT file after creating it using a video editor which has the ability to edit SRT.**

You can also edit the SRT file after creating it by using video editing software such as [Happy Scribe’s](https://www.happyscribe.com/). It has audio-to-text/video-to-text feature that includes multiple timestamps options.

### Language Conversion Feature of SRT file

You can use this to convert each line of your subtitles from one language to another. It also supports language conversion between English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, etc. It's an easy process.

In any of the two cases mantioned above, you need to convert Word document in to SRT. Let’s find out how can you do that without using any software.

Follow the below steps to convert a word file to SRT without any software.

##### Step1 Open your Docx file

For this, open the word document you want to convert.

##### Step2 Change it to a .TXT document

Then from the left corner, Click on File>save as> and select the “Text” to convert it.

If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,

1. Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer
2. Go to view
3. Click on the check box for “File name extensions”

The platform provides various tools to its users including monetization, marketing, collaboration, post-production, management, storage, etc. It provides a great user experience because it is ad-free. The mode of revenue for the owners of Vimeo is a software as a service (SaaS). They provide paid subscription plans for creating and editing videos, broadcasting tools, connecting with clients, etc.

Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones.

**●** **Tell a story**

Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.

**●** **Keep it cohesive**

The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.

**●** **Make it personal**

Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.

**●** **Keep slideshow videos short**

There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.

**●** **Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video**

As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.

The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.

**●** **Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly**

Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.

## Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video

Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don't need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.

**●** **Tell a story**

Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.

**●** **Keep it cohesive**

The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.

**●** **Make it personal**

Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.

**●** **Keep slideshow videos short**

There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.

**●** **Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video**

As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.

The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.

**●** **Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly**

Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.

## What're the Best Alternatives to Pexels?

Sites like Pexels provide you with royalty-free images to include in your messages to further their impact. Although Pexels is a great resource for royalty-free photos and animations, it is not without its limitations. Here is a list of Pexels alternatives for you to consider when creating content. It includes reasons why the sites are suitable alternatives and brief guides on how to get started on them.

## Part1: What are the best alternatives to Pexels?

There are several factors to consider when selecting a suitable image resource for your messaging. For example, you may consider a site favorable to another because of its intuitive user interface, or you may consider another because it has no pesky advertisements. Taking this into consideration, here is a list of the three best Pexels alternatives worth checking out for your next project.

### No.1 Unsplash

![unsplash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-1.jpg)

Unsplash is a stock photo-sharing website run by Getty Images. According to recent reports, the site hosts over 265,000 photographers contributing to a library of over 3.5 million photos. Initially, all photos were under a creative commons license zero, meaning you could distribute the photos without restriction. However, following lobbying from some creators, all photos are now under the Unsplash license.

This means you can still copy, modify, share, and download images for free. However, under the new licensing terms, you cannot use unedited copies of the images for commercial purposes such as T-Shirt printing or branding and using the photos on a similar or competing service.

Most Unsplash users praise it for the following features:

* The library contains tons of high-resolution photos.
* You can access the site through your web browser or the app available on Android and iOS devices.
* There are no download limits to the photos, and everything is free.
* Unsplash is a plugin for various content editing software such as Filmora 11, Adobe XD, and Figma.

Despite all the positives, here are a few improvements to make Unsplash even better.

* The website lacks a free HD video library, which would be a great addition for aspiring content creators.
* In addition, the search algorithm is not as accurate, and you may struggle to find suitable images for your subject matter.

### No.2 Shutterstock

Another Pexels alternative to consider is Shutterstock. It is an online resource where individuals and businesses can access high-quality, licensed photos, videos, illustrations, vectors, and music for their content creation.

![shutterstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-2.jpg)

Unlike Unsplash above, you need to create an account to access Shutterstock services. In addition, the website offers different pricing models for each user, depending on your unique requirements. For example, you can subscribe to an image-only subscription that allows you ten image downloads monthly for $29\. Alternatively, you can purchase the Mix and Match subscription that offers you 25 credits monthly to download different media from the site.

Currently, the website boasts a collection of over 200 million royalty-free images and over 10 million video clips. In addition, the company also offers a percentage-based compensation model to contributors, with first-timers earning up to 15% of content sales. Furthermore, the site continues to populate its library through the acquisition of different companies in a similar space. Some of its notable acquisitions include Turbosquid, Bigstock, Rex Features, and BEImages.

### No.3 Filmstock \[Editor's Choices\]

![filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-3.jpg)

Filmstock is an online library of different editing resources for filmmakers. Some of the resources you can obtain are effects, elements, titles, and audio. In addition, Filmstock is the most recent version of the formerly known Filmora Effects Store. Regardless of the close association with Filmora Video Editing Software, you can still use these resources in your creations on other programs.

Filmstock currently offers its services in three categories. They are:

* A Free package that allows you unlimited downloads of media effects and resources under a royalty-free license. However, any resource you download from the site comes with a Filmora tag.
* The Standard subscription will cost you $9.99 per month and includes free technical support as an additional feature to those available in the free package.
* Finally, the Premium subscription gives you access to the premium library that contains an exclusive selection of the contributors' commercial work. The package will cost you $32.99 monthly and also includes all the features in the previous subscription models.

Kindly note that you must register for a Filmstock or Wondershare account to use the service. In addition, you will need to purchase a separate license to use the service with Filmora Video Editing software.

### No.4 Getty Images

![getty images](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-4.jpg)

Getty Images is an online supplier of media resources for media, creative, and corporate clients. It boasts a resource library of over 477 million entries. Access to the site requires you to create a user account. In addition, some of the prints you will find on the site will require you to make a purchase, depending on the size and quality.

### No.5 iStock

![istock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-5.jpg)

iStock is an online library of creative resources, including music, videos, illustrations, and images. In addition, the site offers access to its exclusive stock-image library through different subscription models. Some of the platforms appealing features include the following:

* An AI-powered search engine that provides more accurate results than Pexels.
* Preset templates for easier creation of videos and social media posts.

### No.6 Flickr

![flickr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-6.jpg)

Flickr is another alternative to Pexels worth considering. This is because it offers you free and paid access to one of the internet's largest creative libraries. In addition, you can select from several licenses, including creative commons and U.S. Government works licenses for your assets, something other similar sites lack in their offering.

### No.7 Pixabay

![pixabay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-7.jpg)

Pixabay gives you access to over 1 million creative assets in different categories, including videos, music, and sound effects. In addition, the site offers its content under the creative commons zero licenses, meaning you can use all stock photos without fear of backlash. Although the site's search function requires work on its accuracy, the numerous categories make it easier to pinpoint your desired image.

### No.8 Adobe Stock

![adobe stock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-8.jpg)

Another site like Pexels is Adobe Stock, where you can access millions of creative assets for your content. Depending on your licensing options, the site offers free and paid access to its services. For example, you can increase your creativity by subscribing to the different Adobe design assets, including Adobe Stock Vector and Adobe Stock Illustrations.

### No.9 Vista Create

![vista create](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-9.jpg)

Vista Create is an online free photo and image website like Pexels that also includes design tools to alter the images to your liking. In addition, you have plenty of templates to suit different platform requirements, including social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. Furthermore, Vista Creare also boasts a wide collection of vectors, which you can customize in three easy steps.

### No.10 LibreStock

![librestock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-10.jpg)

Unlike the ones above, LIbreStock is an aggregator site that combines stock photo databases in a single platform. As such, it is arguably the largest provider of royalty-free images on the web. In addition, it automatically filters out poor-quality images, guaranteeing you excellence each time.

Most LibreStock users name the website's search function as its best feature. This is because it also utilizes search tags when scanning through different databases. As such, you can easily find unique stock photos for your creation, regardless of how outrageous the search tag is. Finally, LibreStock provides its content under the creative commons zero licenses, meaning you can use the assets for personal and commercial work.

### No.11 StockSnap

![stocksnap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-11.jpg)

StockSnap operates similarly to Pexels, as it also offers a variety of free stock photos and images. However, a few tweaks to how you receive these creative assets make it slightly better. For example, StockSnap allows you to download ten free images from Shutterstock if what you need is unavailable in their library.

In addition, the platform also displays the most recent additions to their library in the top search results. As such, you are guaranteed to receive unique pictures without significant overuse.

## Part2: FAQs

### What is better than Pexels?

From the above information, Unsplash ranks as the best alternative to Pexels. This is because of its user-friendly interface, availability across web-based and smartphones, and compatibility with different video editing software such as Adobe XD and [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). As such, its versatility allows you to always create on the go.

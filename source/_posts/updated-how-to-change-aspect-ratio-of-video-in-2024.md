## What Is VHS?

Since its introduction in 1976, VHS has been the most frequently used video cassette recording technology. The VHS format is a consumer-level analog video cassette recording standard for videotaping. The acronym VHS referred to Vertical Helical Scan and was eventually modified as the popularity of this technology increased.

The technology is exclusively utilized in professional settings like TV studios and medical imaging (fluoroscopy).

By 1980, VHS had captured 70% of the market and had established itself as the industry standard for entertainment and instruction.

The original standard has a picture quality equivalent to that of analog television. High-definition television content could be recorded and re-created using digital VHS (D-VHS). Progressively, a new format was launched dubbed S-VHS (Super VHS), which featured improved video quality from 240 to 400 lines; however, people did not use it extensively.

VHS tape, compared to its competition at the time, Betamax tapes had longer tape lifespans. VHS tapes were preferred because they recorded three times as long as Betamax tapes because of their higher storage capacity.

The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.

Progressively, a new format was launched dubbed S-VHS (Super VHS), which featured improved video quality from 240 to 400 lines; however, people did not use it extensively.

VHS tape, compared to its competition at the time, Betamax tapes had longer tape lifespans. VHS tapes were preferred because they recorded three times as long as Betamax tapes because of their higher storage capacity.

The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.

After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe's Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.

### Canva

When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere.

However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.

When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.

We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.

### Promo

Promo has a wonderful look that pops. You may build quick video intros for your social media or YouTube channel by using their intro maker, and then post and share them on your social networks afterwards.

You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.

To summarize, Promo is a video maker that has an impressive design and allows for direct uploads to various social media platforms. The only problem is that their website occasionally becomes unresponsive and sluggish. Because of this, the process of creation can become rather laborious and drawn out.

![promo intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promo-youtube-maker.jpg)

Promo.com is my one-stop-shop for all of my business promotional videos because it offers a variety of video ad templates that I can easily edit on my browser without the need for any program, and they also offer a great selection of stock footage and text overlay options to make the videos look more professional. Promo.com has a lot of awesome templates for a bunch of different categories.

When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.

We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.

### Promo

Promo has a wonderful look that pops. You may build quick video intros for your social media or YouTube channel by using their intro maker, and then post and share them on your social networks afterwards. Promo.com provides filmmakers and video editors with high-quality professional video clips, royalty-free music, adjustable video templates, bespoke text, and logos, and more through their monthly membership programs. You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.

To summarize, Promo is a video maker that has an impressive design and allows for direct uploads to various social media platforms. The only problem is that their website occasionally becomes unresponsive and sluggish. Because of this, the process of creation can become rather laborious and drawn out.

Promo.com is my one-stop-shop for all of my business promotional videos because it offers a variety of video ad templates that I can easily edit on my browser without the need for any program, and they also offer a great selection of stock footage and text overlay options to make the videos look more professional. Promo.com has a lot of awesome templates for a bunch of different categories.

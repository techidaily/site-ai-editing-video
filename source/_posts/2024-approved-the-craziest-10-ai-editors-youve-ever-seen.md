## Method 3: Use InShot to remove sound from video android

There are many ways to remove sound from a video on android. In this part, we'll show you another alternative tool that you can use to mute your videos, namely InShot Video Editor.

InShot is a video editing app for mobile phones with professional features. This app is a great tool for creating short and fancy video clips to share on social media or with friends and family. But to be aware, although you can use Inshot for free, but the app will display some ads.

**App size:** 168 MB

**Rating:** 4.9/5 (Google Playstore)

![inshot’s website banner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-android-11.jpg)

InShot is widely used by android users with more than 500M downloads on Google Playstore, making it one of the most popular video editors for mobile.

InShot offers a variety of features for its users, such as:

* Adding transition effects for videos
* Making a smooth slow motion
* Adding music and voice-overs

The method is a bit more tricky than the other tools mentioned above, but it should work for most people. Now, follow these steps carefully to remove the audio from your video:

##### Step1 Install InShot Video Editor on your phone

The app can take up your phone’s storage, so ensure you have enough space before downloading it. You can find and install the app from Google Playstore by searching “Video Editor & Maker - InShot.”

##### Step2 Open the InShot app and create a new video project

##### Step3 Extract audio from the video

After the video has been added, you should find and click the Volume setting.

Then, click the “Extract audio” button to separate the audio from the video. Tip: if you only want to mute it, you can slide the volume to zero for this step.

##### Step4 Remove the audio

Once you have extracted the audio, select the audio bar and click the delete button to remove it.

##### Step5 Save the changes

Now, you can save the edited video and choose the resolution you need, as well as the frame rate and output format. InShot will also show you the estimated size of the edited file before saving it.

Once done, click “Save,” and the video will be downloaded to your phone.

## Conclusion

For video editing or audio removal, you don’t always have to do it on a PC. You can use **android apps to remove sound from your video** in any case. Among android video editors, some apps let you simply mute the audio, while others remove the audio track entirely.

The above-recommended apps are the best-chosen ones, including Google Photos, Filmora, and InShot. While not every android device supports Google service, you might want to consider Filmora, as it’s a sufficient alternative with a rather smaller size. Hence, it helps you edit your video with ease and smoothly.

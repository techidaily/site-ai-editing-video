While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle.

How to Make a GIF With Transparent Background?

#### In this article

01 [Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?](#Part 1)

02 [Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

## EasyHDR Review: Is This a Good Choice to Create HDR

Any professional photographer knows that “photography” is a broad niche. For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you'll need an HDR program like **EasyHDR**. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers.

Before we dive deeper into this **Easy HDRi** review, let's first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:

### 1\. Effectiveness - 4.8/5

The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn't have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.

### 2\. Price - 4.7/5

Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there's a free demo version, it's pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.

### 3\. Supported OS - 5/5

This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!

### 4\. Ease of use - 4.8

Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.

### 5\. Best for - Beginner HDRi editors

This program's simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you're a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.

**Our Verdict**

Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.

The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33/lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.

But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it's the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.

 Pros

* Simple layout.
* Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.
* Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.
* Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.
* Batch processing supported.
* Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.

 Cons

* It doesn't have advanced HDR post-processing tools.
* No HDR feature for editing.

## Part 2\. Detailed Review for Easy HDR

Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it's important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can't save HDRi in TIFF format. Let's get in!

### 1\. High-Quality Bracket Merging

A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.

### 2\. Editing features

EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.

### 3\. Ghost removal

No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.

### 4\. HDR batch processing

As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.

### 5\. LDR enhancement

Although we've mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it's important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.

## Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop

Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.

1. Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Check the "Media" window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for "frames per second," which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.

## Reasons for Changing Frame Rate

Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.

Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.

However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the "soap opera effect." It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem "unnatural" or less cinematic.

High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That's great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it's also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.

With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video's frame rate.

## How To Change FPS in Premiere Pro

Let's dilly-dally no more. Here's a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.

### l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence

Suppose you want to keep the frame rate of most of the video the same. Only some parts need adjusting. You can change the frame rate of the sequences that need changing instead. Here are the steps to follow to achieve this:

1. Open your project in Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.
3. Choose "Sequence Settings" from the menu that appears.

![sequence settings in adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-sequence-3.JPG)

1. Click the drop-down menu for "Timebase."
2. Select the frame rate you want the sequence to be in.

1. Click "OK."

### l Change the Frame Rate of a Video Clip

Here are the steps you should follow if you want to change the frame rate of an entire video clip.

1. Import your video clip to Premiere Pro and drag it to the timeline.
2. Go to the "Effects" tab. It's in the options at the bottom left of the screen.

![effects tab in adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-clip-2.JPG)

1. Select "Video Effects" > "Time" > "Posterize Time."

![posterize time video effect option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-clip-3.JPG)

1. Drag and drop the Posterize Time effect to the clip whose frame rate you want to change.
2. Click "Effect Controls" at the top left of the screen.
3. Select the small "arrow" button next to the "Frame Rate" text under "Posterize Time."
4. Change the frame rate to your preferred setting. For example, type "60" to make the video 60 fps.

1. Click "Sequence" > "Render Selection."

And that's it! That is how you change a video clip's frame rate in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How To Make 120 FPS Videos With Premiere Pro

Videos that are 120 fps are very popular now. If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You'd want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.

Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it's a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That's obviously not the number that we want. Don't worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it's super easy.

Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:

1. Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, "Drop media here to create sequence."

![dragging video to premiere pro timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-120-fps-2.JPG)

1. Select the timeline panel. Click "Sequence" > "Sequence Settings."
2. Check the "Timebase" section. It should say "119.88 frames/second," 120 fps when rounded off.

![checking if the fps is 120](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-120-fps-4.JPG)

1. Edit the video as needed and render it. The output should stay at 120 fps.

## Use Mobile Phones to Shoot a Video Is Very Convenient Compare with Professional Cameras. In This Article, We’ll List You some Tips to Help Capture a High-Quality Video on Your Phone

Never before has video recording been so simple or effortless. Everybody has a smartphone, which is a capable video camera, in their pocket. In fact, the use of smartphones for mobile creation has increased to the point that some people consider it to be the main function and equally crucial to communication.

Pocket-lint has compiled ten ideas in an effort to assist you in getting whatever it is you want in the best possible way. Even if some of the advice may seem apparent, using it all should always produce fantastic videos.

![shoot a video on phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/shoot-a-video-on-phone.jpg)

## 1\. Get ready for filming

Make sure that you have everything you need to start recording your videos, including the necessary

equipment, props, scripts, actors, and locations, before you start the recording process. In addition, ensure that your mobile device is of high quality and that it has a sufficient amount of storage space (available memory) to save the film. High definition (HD) video files can be quite large and storing them can quickly deplete a battery's capacity.

![get ready for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-ready-for-filming.jpg)

They add a great point; you need to think about stabilization, and they've included a few great options for

obtaining steady video. This video by Filmic Pro titled "5 Things to Do Before You Shoot iPhone Video" covers a lot of what we've discussed as well, including memory storage, battery life, audio, and resolution.

## 2\. Use good lighting

Because smartphone cameras have smaller image sensors and lenses, proper illumination has a significant impact on their performance. As much as you can, try to film your video in well-lit environments. By doing this, you can reduce the amount of unwanted shadow and grain in your video. On the other hand, you also need to be cautious to avoid pointing the camera straight towards bright light sources because this will result in useless overexposed footage and lens flare. The lighting should be consistent and steady because most smartphone image sensors take a while to respond to abrupt changes in brightness.

![use good lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/use-good-lighting.jpg)

If shooting your video in low light is still difficult, experiment with your phone's or app's backlighting and white balance settings. In case your camera is focusing on the incorrect part of your composition, most phones now provide "touch focusing." The automatic exposure control will have an easier time making minor adjustments if the lighting condition changes once the focus has been placed on the most crucial part of the video.

## 3\. Film horizontally, not vertically

Your natural inclination may be to hold the smartphone in a vertical position when you are using it to record video, just as you do when you are using it for the vast majority of other purposes. However, if you want to edit your video and post it online and on social media, this may place certain restrictions on your ability to do so.

![film horizontally mobile phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/film-horizontally-mobile-phone.jpg)

## 4\. Make sure to have good audio

We're going to go ahead and say that sound is one of the most essential components of any video. The difficulty is in the fact that the audio quality on your smartphone is not always of the highest caliber. When it comes to audio, there is a general rule that the smartphone should be as close to the speaker as is physically possible in order to obtain the clearest sound possible from it. Even if you are only a few meters away from the person whose voice you want to record on your smartphone, you won't be able to get a good recording of them.

This is not the fault of your smartphone; rather, smartphones are intended to be used by speaking into them at close range; hence, you should think about employing the use of an external microphone in order to improve the sound quality. However, if you are unable to do so, there is no need for concern because you can use an additional smartphone in its place.

You can record audio on your mobile device by opening the voice memo app and selecting the record button. Your audio will immediately be improved if you position the phone's microphone such that it is facing your topic and is somewhat close to them. Clap once at the beginning of the recording to serve as a reference point for both the video and the audio, which will help you save time while editing. After that, it will be simple for you to locate the point at which the clap occurred and synchronize the high-quality audio that is on the memo with the audio that is in your film.

## 5\. Edit your video

Now that you've gathered all of your film, it's time to cut it up, add some color, and get creative with effects! Fortunately, there are numerous video editing apps available that make it easier and faster than ever to use. You can edit videos on your phone just as you would on a computer using apps like Adobe Rush and iMovie, and it's easier than you think.

![edit video on mobile phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/edit-video-on-mobile-phone.jpg)

You've probably heard of iMovie, Apple's free video editing software that works on both your iPhone and Mac. You can add titles, music, and additional effects to your video clips, much like in Adobe Rush. iMovie is really easy to use, especially if you're new to editing. The main distinction between Adobe Rush and iMovie is that Adobe Rush includes more professional and technical changes, whilst iMovie has a considerably larger selection of video effects and transitions.

Adobe Rush is the most user-friendly app for editing and creating high-quality films on your smartphone. One of Adobe Rush's best features is the ability to incorporate motion graphics, video effects, text, and mix audio. If you prefer a larger screen to edit on, Adobe Rush seamlessly transfers the files to your computer, allowing you to resume editing where you left off on your smartphone. This program is simple to use, and there are numerous guidelines and tutorials available online to help you get started.

## Conclusion

You probably weren't aware of this, but your smartphone is actually a very capable piece of equipment that can be used to record videos of a high quality. You will be able to enhance the quality of your material to a greater extent by putting into practice the strategies that are discussed in this piece. Grab your smartphone and get ready to start producing content that the people in your fanbase will always come back for.

Step5 Click on the ‘first color’ and select the eye dropper tool. This will allow us to select the red flower in the preview window. You can also click different parts of the image to get the color that we want.

Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.

Step7 Pick the eyedropper tool and click it on the green part of the clip. Then adjust the range slider as needed.

Alright, let’s watch back the video to see how both colors are now isolated.

Follow all the steps in the correct order. This is how you can use NewBlue effects for color isolation using Wondershare Filmora. The color isolation using the selective color effect defines the point of interest in the clip for the viewers.

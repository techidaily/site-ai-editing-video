## 6 Best MP4 Mergers to Join Videos Easily

Not all software allows you to combine videos in the MP4 format. And even if they do, the quality you get is not satisfying. The reason is pretty basic – overrated and underrated video merging software. Some tools are complicated, while others are extremely user-friendly with the interface and options.

So, after spending several days on the research, finally, here are the **6 best mp4 mergers** along with their tutorials to help you understand the process and complexity of each software and pick the best one in terms of simplicity and user-friendliness.

#### In this article

01 [Free Video Joiner](#part1)

02 [Freemake Video Converter](#part2)

03 [Boilsoft Video Joiner](#part3)

04 [Media Cope](#part4)

05 [MP4Joiner by MP4Tools](#part5)

06 [Filmora by Wondershare](#part6)

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

### Merging Videos in Free Video Joiner

**Step1: Download Free Video Joiner**

Open your browser and go to the [Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) website. Then, click the “Download” button on the page to save the setup on your computer.

## Part 2: Freemake Video Converter (For Windows Users Only)

[Freemake Video Converter](https://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter2/) is reliable software to convert videos without registration. The program is free to download with more than 180 million users worldwide. And not just the MP4, but you can convert videos in all the popular formats and use the program to copy and burn DVDs.

Apart from the video conversion feature, you can use Freemake to merge your MP4 videos from your Windows operating system. However, the software is unavailable for MAC users, and it is one of the major drawbacks of this video merger.

### Merging Videos in Freemake Video Converter

**Step 1: Download Freemake Video Converter**

First, go to the [Freemake Video Converter](https://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter2/) website and click on the “Free Download” button.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-11.jpeg)

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-12.jpeg)

**Step 2: Add Videos**

Click on the “Video” tab from the top menu to select videos you want to merge.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-13.jpeg)

As you can see below, two videos are uploaded on the software.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-14.jpeg)

**Step 3: Rearrange Video Order**

If you wish to rearrange the videos, you can do it by simply dragging the video up or down with the help of your mouse.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-15.jpeg)

For example, the “Photo Slideshow” video, which was previously on the top, is now placed beneath the “Intro” video.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

That means the merged video will begin from the “Intro” video, and then the “Photo Slideshow” will continue right after the first clip ends. All be done without any break or pause.

**Step 4: Join Videos**

After rearranging the videos, use your mouse to select clips by clicking once on each video. All selected videos will be highlighted in the “light blue” color.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-17.jpeg)

Then, take the mouse cursor on the top-right side of the software and turn on the “Join Files” button by clicking on it.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-18.jpeg)

You will see that a merged video will be added to the software.

For instance, you can see that a new file has been added to the interface, showing the number of merged files in the red circle.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-19.jpeg)

The above screenshot represents a single merged video that includes two files.

**Step 5: Choose Your Output Video Format**

Look at the bottom of the software to see different video formats, and click on “MP4.”

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-50.jpeg)

**Step 2: Import Videos You Want to Merge**

Use your mouse to click the blue “+” icon in the center of the software to import videos from your computer.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-51.jpeg)

Then, drag-and-drop the videos to your timeline. But make sure that you place both clips on the same timeline. As you can see below, there are two clips. The first clip is named “Travel 05,” while the second video is called “Travel 06.”

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-52.jpeg)

**Step 3: Fill the Gap to Merge**

When you will drag-and-drop videos on the timeline, the chances are that there will be a gap or a blank space between the two clips, like this.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-53.jpeg)

If this blank space is left untreated, the merged video will include this empty black space, as you can see on the preview screen.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-54.jpeg)

Therefore, use your right mouse click to hold the second video and drag it to the wall of the first video without leaving any gap in between both clips.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-55.jpeg)

Great! You have already merged the videos. Now, let’s move on to the final step.

**Step 4: Export the Joined Video and Save in MP4**

Click on the “Export” option on the left of the preview screen to see the settings window.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-56.jpeg)

Under the “Local” tab, select “MP4” and feel free to perform other changes, such as choosing an output folder, renaming the merged video, picking the resolution, and more. Once you are satisfied with the settings, click on the “Export” button (on the right bottom of the screen) to save the video on your computer.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-57.jpeg)

And it’s done!

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

**Step 3: Rearrange Video Order**

If you wish to rearrange the videos, you can do it by simply dragging the video up or down with the help of your mouse.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

That means the merged video will begin from the “Intro” video, and then the “Photo Slideshow” will continue right after the first clip ends. All be done without any break or pause.

**Step 4: Join Videos**

After rearranging the videos, use your mouse to select clips by clicking once on each video. All selected videos will be highlighted in the “light blue” color.

Use your mouse to click the blue “+” icon in the center of the software to import videos from your computer.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-51.jpeg)

Then, drag-and-drop the videos to your timeline. But make sure that you place both clips on the same timeline. As you can see below, there are two clips. The first clip is named “Travel 05,” while the second video is called “Travel 06.”

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-52.jpeg)

**Step 3: Fill the Gap to Merge**

When you will drag-and-drop videos on the timeline, the chances are that there will be a gap or a blank space between the two clips, like this.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-53.jpeg)

If this blank space is left untreated, the merged video will include this empty black space, as you can see on the preview screen.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-54.jpeg)

Therefore, use your right mouse click to hold the second video and drag it to the wall of the first video without leaving any gap in between both clips.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-55.jpeg)

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-51.jpeg)

Then, drag-and-drop the videos to your timeline. But make sure that you place both clips on the same timeline. As you can see below, there are two clips. The first clip is named “Travel 05,” while the second video is called “Travel 06.”

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-52.jpeg)

**Step 3: Fill the Gap to Merge**

When you will drag-and-drop videos on the timeline, the chances are that there will be a gap or a blank space between the two clips, like this.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-53.jpeg)

If this blank space is left untreated, the merged video will include this empty black space, as you can see on the preview screen.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-54.jpeg)

Therefore, use your right mouse click to hold the second video and drag it to the wall of the first video without leaving any gap in between both clips.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-55.jpeg)

## Bottom Line

Among the 6 best MP4 mergers, Filmora seems to be winning. It’s not just a video editor with plenty of tools, but you can also join two or more videos in MP4 format without sacrificing the video quality.

On the other hand, video merges like Free Video Joiner, Freemake, Media Cope, Boilsoft Video Joiner, and MP4 Joiner have limited options. Plus, they are time-consuming, and some of them even disturb the video and audio quality when clips are merged through them.

## FAQs

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

**Step1: Download Free Video Joiner**

Open your browser and go to the [Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) website. Then, click the “Download” button on the page to save the setup on your computer.

As you can see below, two videos are uploaded on the software.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-14.jpeg)

**Step 3: Rearrange Video Order**

If you wish to rearrange the videos, you can do it by simply dragging the video up or down with the help of your mouse.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-15.jpeg)

For example, the “Photo Slideshow” video, which was previously on the top, is now placed beneath the “Intro” video.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

That means the merged video will begin from the “Intro” video, and then the “Photo Slideshow” will continue right after the first clip ends. All be done without any break or pause.

**Step 4: Join Videos**

After rearranging the videos, use your mouse to select clips by clicking once on each video. All selected videos will be highlighted in the “light blue” color.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-17.jpeg)

Then, take the mouse cursor on the top-right side of the software and turn on the “Join Files” button by clicking on it.

## Easy Way to Add Transitions to Videos

Editing a video is equally important as recording a video. A raw video footage is never appealing to the eyes because of sudden cuts, unnecessary parts, and lack of eye-catching effects. That is why video editing is crucial for turning an unappealing raw video into an attention-grabbing video. As a matter of fact, the way you edit your video makes your video stand out when you are posting on social media platforms.

One of the most important aspects of video editing is adding transitions to video clips. When you jump from one scene to another and make sudden cuts, you need to apply some video transitions so that the move from one scene to another becomes soothing to the eyes. Different video editors have different transition effects and [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has the best collection of transitions. We will illustrate how to add transition in Filmora and how to improve your video with video transitions.

## Part 1\. What is a Video transition effect?

A video transition effect is the most commonly used graphical effect in video editing. A video transition effect is essential whereby you connect one shot to another, especially when you are making sudden cuts in the video. Therefore, a video transition effect sits in between two shots and connects them together smoothly so that it does not look odd to the eyes. Video editing with transitions is a common practice for short videos on social media, presentation videos, and even movies.

A video transition effect is effective when you are jumping from two moods and emotions in the video. It is equally useful while jumping between storylines, points of view, and timelines. Besides, you can spice up your narrative and make your video eye-catching as well as eye-soothing. There are different types of video transition effects such as fade in and out, zoom in and out, dissolve, wipe and pan.

## Part 2\. How to add transitions in video?

To add transitions to your video, you will need a video editor. You should choose a video editor that has a wide collection of transition effects so that you can apply them to your video as per your preference. If you are someone who regularly makes videos and edits them, a variety of transitions will make the videos look different. There are Movie Maker transitions for Windows users and iMovie transitions for Mac users.

## Part 3\. Video transitions tips and tricks

If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.

**Consistency** – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.

**Experiment** – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.

**Out of the Box** – The reason you recommended [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.

**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.

**Meaningful** – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood. Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.

## The Bottom Line

Video transition effects are essential in almost all types of videos. They enhance the video content and make the transition between scenes smoother. You should choose your video editor wisely so that you can avail different types of video transition effects. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for its better collection of video transition effects for all types of videos.

## Read on to Learn About OpenCV Object Tracking, What It Is, and How to Implement It in Python, and OpenCV

**OpenCV Tracking** is a popular method used for tracking objects in a video in real-time. OpenCV is a powerful library used for image processing and computer vision applications.

From real-time video analysis to Augmented Reality, OpenCV Tracking has a wide range of uses and can help both private and public sectors to detect and track the desired object in an image or video.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore **OpenCV Tracking** and its pre-built trackers**.** We will use the OpenCV library and Python to implement this Object Tracking application.

## Part 1\. What Is Object Tracking?

Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.

Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.

Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it's a challenge, it's not impossible to accomplish.

And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:

### 1\. SOT & MOT

1. **Single Object Tracking (SOT):** SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and/or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.
2. **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):** MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.

### 2\. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection

After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.

The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.

## Part 2\. Types Of Object Tracking

### Image Tracking

Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.

Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.

### Video Tracking

Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.

## Part 3\. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?

As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:

**Background Clutter:** The background can impact extracting an object's features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.

**Occlusion:** This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.

**Varying spatial scales:** Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.

**Training and Tracking Speed:** If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.

## Part 4\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.

### 1\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:

**Target Initialization**

Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.

**Appearance Modeling**

Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.

**Motion Estimation**

Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object's future position with precision.

**Target Positioning**

Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object's location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target's location more accurately.

### 2\. Methods Of Object Tracking

Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:

**OpenCV-Based Object Tracking**

**OpenCV Object Tracking** method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.

**MDNet**

Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.

The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.

**DeepSort**

DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.

DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.

**ROLO**

ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.

## Part 5\. The powerful backup: OpenCV

We have demonstrated how powerful OpenCV Tracking is and how it works. However, do you wonder what OpenCV is? How it supports the tracking goals being achieved? In this part, we will focus on OpenCV and help you better understand the the underlying mechanisms.

### 1\. What Is OpenCV?

| **MOSSE Tracker**      | Able to continue tracking after the object is lost. High speed.     | Loses object easily if very high speed.                             |
| **CSRT Tracker**       | Good resistance to overlapping. High accuracy.                      | Low speed. Unstable when an object is lost.                         |

### 3\. Implementation In Python And OpenCV

Now, after theoretical explanation of OpenCV and OpenCV Tracking, let’s learn **Object Tracking OpenCV Python** with coding and our simple and step-by-step instructions:

**Install The Dependencies**

Install the _pycharm_ app on your PC, and launch it. Create a new project and go to **Terminal.** Install the _opencv-contrib-python_ package by pasting the following command into the **Terminal.**

**Set Up the Trackers**

Now, create a Jupyter-notebook and set up the trackers with this code:

**Tasks:**

* cv2\. version returns the OpenCV library version number.
* Save the name of the eight trackers.
* Check the list for the version you are working on and create a tracker object based on the number.

**Capture The Video Input**

For capturing the video input, write the following lines of code:

**Tasks:**

* Use the VideoCapture class to capture a video via the webcam or get a saved one from your PC.
* In VideoCapture - line 2, give the path to your video.
* Comment on the second line to use the webcam for tracking and uncomment the third one.

**Creating The Bounding Box And Initializing The Tracker**

Define an initial random bounding box or select the choices for the object you want to track with the following code:

**Start The Tracker And Check The Output**

Finally, write the below code lines to start the tracker:

**Tasks**

* Read each video frame.
* Start the timer and, through the tracker, determine the trajectory of the object.
* Use the trajectory to draw the bounding box.
* The program will start tracking. Afterward, press the space bar to stop tracking.

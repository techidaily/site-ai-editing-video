The software includes selecting different screens where you want the wallpaper to appear, making it possible to apply it to different screens at once.

To select the gif you want:

**●** You can paste the URL of the gif you want to use.

**●** You can also use the "create playlist" field to add multiple gifs as your background.

**●** You can select a file from your device using the "select file" option.

**●** Or you can choose from hundreds of gifs present in the plastuer library.

**●** You can disable the wallpaper whenever you wish by clicking on the "disable wallpaper" option.

This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

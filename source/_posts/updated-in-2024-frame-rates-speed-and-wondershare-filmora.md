## Movavi Slideshow Maker Is a Powerful Video Editing Tool that Can Be Used to Add Rich Effects to Videos Easily. This Guide Will Introduce the Features and Show You How to Apply Effects to Videos with This Tool

Many video editors won't be late in their artwork. They tend to use different effects to light up their crafts. For them, editing videos with effects applications gives more life to the story. In this composition, you will learn more about Effects, and if you are just about to do your video editing right now, these details are definitely for you.

## What are Video Effects?

According to the dictionary, an effect is brought about by a cause or an agency.

In video editing, there are a few video effects you must know to apply them to your video project. Video effects can alter the speed and produce distortions, reflections, aesthetic filters, stylistic color grading, animation transitions, and more. They can also contain 3D features like CGI. When used well, these effects improve the narrative, the atmosphere, and the images' overall impact.

Let's dissect a few of the major effects, which will be most helpful to you.

**Pans and Tilts**

Your first thought upon hearing these two words may be tripod motions. Pans and tilts are a quick way to add additional movement and sensation to your video, making it more dynamic.

**Change the Speed/Duration**

One feature that virtually every NLE or Non-Linear Editing software gives us is the option to modify the playback speed of your video while reducing or increasing the actual duration and tempo of your segments. Slowing down your footage to match the frame rate at which the video was initially captured is one of the critical explanations for doing this.

To incorporate some frantic or chaotic moments into your production, you can use this to generate slow-motion shots and fast-forward effects. This effect can also quickly pan through footage for humorous effect. Find the "Speed/Duration" option under Effects controls to accomplish this.

**Light Leaks and Flares**

Nothing gives your video a more ethereal vibe than gentle, warm light emerging from the scene. A direct source visible in the photo may be the source of this light, or it may enter the frame from the edge. You've probably seen these flares and leaks countless times in movies, whether they were added in post-production or resulted from the cinematographer's lens choice. You can select where the light comes from if it doesn't distract from the task. Remember that these spills and flares must contribute to the narrative while remaining barely perceptible to the viewer.

**Retro/VHS Effects**

While light leaks and lens flares give your movie or film a timeless feel, nothing gives it a dated or, one would say, "scrappy" vibe. The grunge appearance of the '90s is in right now, and one of the most popular effects is the VHS look.

There are several ways to get this effect. Applying a preset, essentially a LUT (look-up table or filter), to your color grade will make the image appear fuzzier, desaturated, and blurrier (using the different alpha and gamma channels). This will cause "chroma errors," which result from poor recordings and a lack of a flying erase head (a function that enables you to record over previously filmed video; imagine formatting your SD card while the video is still present on the card and you are simply recording over it), giving your images an outline of distorted blues and reds.

**Color Grading and Color Correction**

Besides actual editing, color grading and correction are arguably the most significant post-production steps. With the help of these tools, you may alter skin tones, highlight, and shadow levels, add vignettes, experiment with contrast, and much more. We'll briefly go through one aspect of color grading—the ability to adjust particular colors in your image—even though this subject needs its ebook.

**Adding Overlays**

Although we've talked about adding overlays, such as VHS effects or light leaks, you may use many other editing overlays to add particular components to your shot, including weather particles!

**Using Titles and Motion Graphics**

Motion graphics and clean titles are essential for any video that wishes to appear professional. These could be subtitles, and the animation logo reveals post-credits, lower thirds, or even major titles. There are various free typefaces available that you may use to make your project stand out, regardless of the program you're working in.

Once you've selected the appropriate font, color, and weight, it's time to move on to motion graphics. These are crucial because they may transform a clear, ageless title or text into a lively, entertaining illustration of the product or concept your movie is attempting to market.

The abundance of tutorials nowadays makes learning the fundamentals of motion graphics a piece of cake. As I previously stated, you can access all the various effects and movements you might need, regardless of the editing program, you use.

These various methods and approaches need the practice to perfect, just like any other component of filmmaking. As you add these video editing effects to your editing toolkit, there will undoubtedly be a lot of trial and error. Still, eventually, they will become second nature to your workflow.

**Importance of Applying Effects to your Video**

Almost from the first motion film, cinematic storytelling and video effects have gone hand in hand. They can improve a scene, create something that doesn't exist, hide an error, and do much more. In essence, they assist a filmmaker in telling a tale in the manner they desire.

## Applying Effects using Movavi Slideshow Maker

Making picture collages is less appealing than slide show presentations. This method is ideal for presenting a gallery of images or creating a polished photo-video presentation for your brand and goods. You'll need a creative slideshow program with loads of capabilities to create a polished slideshow that will enhance your production. The Movavi Slideshow Maker now comes into play.

In this composition, I will show you how to apply "Effects" on your video using Movavi Slideshow Maker video editing software. A professional slideshow program called Movavi slideshow creator is made for usage by both professional and amateur picture editors.

![drag video to track movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-video-to-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

## Applying Filter effects

A video filter is software that modifies a multimedia stream somehow. A filter graph is a series of filters that each accept input from an upstream filter, process the information, and then output the edited video to their downstream counterparts.

Step1 Click the **Filter** tab.

![click filter movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-filter-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step4 If you finally chose a Filter effect, drag it onto the imported video.

Step5 And now you will see the changes. The “star” symbol on the imported video means you have already applied a Filter effect on it.

![star symbol movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/star-symbol-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

**Raw Footage vs With Applied Filter Effect**

_Raw Footage_

_Brush – Sketch Filter effect_

![brush sketch filter effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/brush-sketch-filter-effect.jpg)

## Adding Transition Effect

Transitions guide your audience.

From the opening to the very end, they structure the movie. There are numerous typical forms, including the wipe, dissolve, split-cut, and many others. Film editors use transitions to transfer a scene from one video clip to another practice. Transitions don't need to be visible.

Step1 Click the **Transition** tab.

![click transition movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-transition-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Choose your desired Transition effect depending on your preferred category.

![select transition movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-transition-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step3 You can see the preview of a Transition effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.

![preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/preview-filter-effect-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step4 If you finally chose a Transition effect, drag it between each imported video.

![choose to add transition movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-to-add-transition-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step5 Now you will see this kind of symbol, which means you have already put a Transition effect between the imported videos.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**_Note:_** Transition effects can also be applied even if you have only one video.

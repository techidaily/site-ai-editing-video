## Part 1\. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora

Filmora's powerful video editing menu includes easy tweaking on audio. You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.

Step1 Create a new project and import the video to Filmora.

![import the video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 Separate the audio component from the video by right-clicking on the video and selecting the Detach Audio option. You can now edit each of them individually.

![detach the audio component](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Mark the part to place the start of the beep using the playhead and click the Split icon on the editor’s toolbar.

Though it is based on colours, they learn the process of classification and sorting, which then gets applied to the other factors in life.

**●** **Learning about safety and health through colours**

The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures.

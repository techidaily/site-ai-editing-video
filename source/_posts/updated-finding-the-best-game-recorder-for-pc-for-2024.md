## With the HDR Feature, You Can Make Your Images Look More Realistic and Add More Depth to Them. But if You Are Clueless as to How This Can Be Done Using Your Android Devices and the Best Situations for the Same, Then This Article Will Just Be an Apt Read

The present-day high-end smartphones, like iPhone, Samsung, and Huawei, come packed in with advanced camera features that can let you capture interesting and bright images having depth. To get this done, you first need to check if your smartphone has an HDR mode and if it does, how to use the same.

So, we are here to help you to learn in detail about HDR Android photography and how to use the HDR mode on your smartphone. Keep reading till the read and we assure you that you will be able to capture some breath-taking images with your phone.

![hdr mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hdr-photography-how-to-use-hdr-mode-on-your-android-devices-7.jpg)

## Part 1: What is HDR photography?

First things first. Before using the HDR feature on your smartphone, let’s learn what actually is the function of HDR.

Standing for High Dynamic Range, HDR is an image capturing method where the dynamic range of an image is high. When we talk about dynamic range, it refers to the difference between the lightest and the darkest elements of a picture. Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.

While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.

Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.

![hdr mode vs non hdr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hdr-photography-how-to-use-hdr-mode-on-your-android-devices-4.jpg)

## Part 2: How to tell if I can shoot HDR images on my Android devices or not?

HDR images can be captured using DSLR cameras, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the camera and the process of capturing the HDR images. A simpler alternative to this is using an Android device. The principle of capturing HDR images using an Android phone is simpler in comparison to a professional DSLR camera and also quick. Using an Android device, the imbalance in the exposure is corrected and the details of the image background, as well as the foreground, are enhanced.

**How-to steps to check the HDR camera Android feature**

So now that you know that HDR images can be easily captured using your Android device, the next important thing is to check if your phone supports the HDR feature or not as not all Android devices have the HDR mode. Below listed are some of the options where you can the HDR option in the camera app of your Android device.

* Check for the HDR option under the Shooting Mode menu (this can be found on high-end Samsung phones.)
* In the devices like HTC One X, Desire X, and others with custom Camera apps, the feature can be found under the Camera Scenes section.

### Effective Key Features of Filmora

Besides smooth playback, Filmora offers powerful AI features to edit videos. Let's explore some of its dynamic and innovative options.

* [**AI Copilot**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** This tool provides you with an AI assistant in case you are unfamiliar with editing basics. It can not only guide you but also navigate towards the respective features. Users can ask anything and find solutions with natural language prompts.

* [**AI Music Generator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** Are you tired of internet surfing but haven't found perfect music? Filmora offers AI-generated music that perfectly aligns with your content needs. It allows you to choose the number of music tracks, moods, and duration of the videos.

* [**AI Image**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** With Filmora, getting a copyright-free image is not a big deal. Users have to describe an image and pick one style to grab their dream image. Also, they can select an aspect ratio to start creating an image.

* [**AI Smart Masking**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** Often, the best-captured media seems useless because of its messy background. AI masking comes to rescue your projects. You can use the Chroma key or AI portrait to remove or change the backgrounds of the media.

## Conclusion

To wrap up, **Adobe Premiere Pro's slow playback** can occur for several reasons. Many solutions are discussed above to tackle such errors and avoid frustration. Meanwhile, you can use Wondershare Filmora, which is much easier. Also, it does not cause any errors while working and ensures a smooth workflow. With AI features, users can effectively perform every kind of video editing task.

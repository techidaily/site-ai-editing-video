There are so many gamers who put up their gameplay videos on social media and video streaming platforms. While editing the video, they need to put up animated text so that the video content looks interesting and engaging. If you have a gaming video, Filmora has around 500 text effects and animations to use in your video. Go to Titles> Gaming and select from any creative text animations as per your preference.

## How To Change Speed of Video in Final Cut Pro?

When there are certain boring but necessary parts in your video, you need to speed them up. Similarly, you may need to reduce the duration of the entire video. Speeding up the video is your only option when you do not want to cut any part. You must have also observed that certain videos look funny when you speed them up. To speed up videos, you will need a video editor that does not degrade the video quality.

Final Cut Pro is a popular choice to speed up video without distorting the pitch. Many think that the video quality can degrade when they change the speed of the video clip. This concern can be taken care of when you alter the video speed with Final Cut Pro. Instead of changing the speed of the entire video, you can change the speed of specific parts. We will illustrate how to speed up the video using Final Cut Pro and suggest a better choice than FCP.

![speed up the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-1.jpg)

## Part I. Speed Up Video using Final Cut Pro

Here are the steps for the Final Cut Pro speed-up clip.

Step1 Open FCP. Navigate to File>New> and tap Project to start a new project.

![start a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-2.jpg)

## Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro

You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.

**Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -**

By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video's speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.

**Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -**

You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project's frame rate.

You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.

![speed up automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

**Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -**

Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.

The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.

## Part III. The Right Final Cut Pro Alternative for Changing Speed - Filmora

## Part 3 Recording Slide Show Powerpoint Q&A

### 01What are the advantages of recording a slide show PowerPoint?

Recording a slide show PowerPoint is an easy way to capture the information from your slides into an editable video that you can share with your audience. It's also easy for people who missed the presentation or need to review it later, as well as for those who want to use it for other purposes like marketing collateral or educational content. By **recording a slide show PowerPoint,** you're able to retain the benefits of giving a live presentation without all the hassle of actually delivering it in person.

### 02How can I record a slide show PowerPoint?

There are a few ways to record a slide show PowerPoint, including using the PowerPoint recording option. If you are using PowerPoint, you should be able to find the option in your presentation settings. But if you are not fond of trying it out, you can use **Filmora.** This is one of the best video editing tools available, with some exclusive features. This has the simplest interface, and users can get their presentation recorded needs catered for sure.

### 03How can I use my recorded slideshows in different presentations?

There are many ways to do this. You could export the slideshow as a .mp4 file and then import it into another presentation for reuse.

It is best if you start by finding out what you want to say with your presentation. Then, select images that support your message, and finally, create slides that tell your story.

This process will save a lot of time and effort when it comes to creating slide shows for presentations.

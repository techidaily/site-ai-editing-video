**How to make a countdown animation with Canva**

Canva offers a range of great-looking countdown templates that'll help you create one in just a few minutes. And if you need a simple countdown animation, you can download one of their free templates. Let's make it from scratch:

##### Step1 Select The Background

With Canva, you get a wide range of free backgrounds. Click on the button labeled "Search." Now choose the "light old film" background element and click Add.

![select background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-12.png)

##### Step2 Enter Your Text (Number)

Then select the text tab and choose any font style, color, and size.

![enter your number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-13.png)

##### Step3 Animate Text

Next, select the font again, and then, at the top, there's an option for Text Animation.

Adding text animation to your countdown timer will make it more realistic and match your background better than a straight-up countdown timer.

![animate text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-14.png)

##### Step4 Edit The Page Timing

Next, click on the “Edit Timing” option. You can set the timer for each page as per your choice

![edit page timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-15.png)

##### Step5 Duplicate The Page

Now, select the duplicate page option and change the number of duplicate pages from 3 to 2,1, with the same design and formatting.

![duplicate the page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-16.png)

##### Step6 Export / Download Video

You're finally done! Click the Download button to export your design.

The background of this photo is not a static image, so you cannot select the JPG, PNG, or SVG. You must choose an MP4 video or a GIF when creating an animation.

## Backup and Organize Your Footage in Minutes

Backing up your data is deemed significantly necessary among video editing communities. Files get corrupted easily. Having a backup drive can save your day and countless hours. You can back up your data any way you deem fit. However, it will do you right if you follow the advice of professionals.

The article is written explicitly after due consideration and suggestions from the professional video editor. You can follow the steps in it to make backup files. Let us start with very straightforward steps to help you understand the professional way of backing up and organizing your footage.

## Part 1\. Back Up Your Files

Backing up your files gives you peace of mind. If one file is lost, the whole project becomes vulnerable to failure. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure the protection of files. The best way to protect the files from any misfortune is to back them up.

Remember, there is no specific way to back up your files. Depending on the project's requirements, you can do that differently. The following steps will light up how you can back up your files.

##### Step1Back up your files in two different places

It is crucial to do that. If one backup drive corrupts, you have the second option. It gives you an opportunity to back up files.

* You can make two different external backup hard drives.

![back up your data on two different external drives](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-two-different-external-drive.jpg)

* You can also use your internal and external devices as two backup options.

![back up your data on an internal and external hard drive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-an-internal-and-external-hard-drive.jpg)

##### Step2Make specific folders for each purpose of the video

The next step is how you back up your files properly and safely. Make separate folders for the different formats you are importing in your drive. Always use the primary source to make a copy of your files.

Follow the steps below to understand how to back up your files in two drives.

* Create a folder in your drive.
* Name it. You can name it according to the given format. The choice is yours.

![format for naming your file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/format-for-naming-your-file.jpg)

* Your backup folder is created.
* Make new folders based on the files that are imported into the file. We are making two folders for the project, 01 Footage, and 02 Audio.  
  * 01 Footage is for the original footage.  
  * 02 Audio is for audio files provided by the music artist.

![make folders for different formats in the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/make-folders-for-different-formats-in-the-video.jpg)

##### Step3Repeat the same process in your second backup drive

* Make the same folders and sub-folders in your secondary backup drive.

![secondary storage device with same folder names](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/secondary-storage-device-with-same-folder-names.jpg)

##### Step4Transfer files to your primary and secondary folders

* Transfer files to folders and sub-folders in your first backup drive.
* Transfer files to folders and sub-folders in your secondary backup drive.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Most people make the mistake of making a backup drive and then using the same drive to make the second backup. The approach needs to be corrected.

We are done with backing up our files. It is time to organize the files in your drive.

## How Can Filmora Create an Audio Visualizer Project for a Song? All Steps, From Launching the App to Editing the Text, Are Detailed Here

While editing videos, the ability to edit the audio in the background is one of the key ingredients of successful video making. For this purpose, the Audio Visualizer as a resource on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a high-quality option. With this feature, users can typically add audio effects to their video soundtrack with AI technology, aligning the sound properly with the video.

It is possible to choose out of 25 different effects for audio visualization on this software for customized audio effects. You can also drag visual-based effects to the file, which the software mechanism will automatically configure with the sound cohesively.

While this is useful as a functionality, users naturally have concerns about how to handle the Audio Visualization effect to work on video projects and podcasts. Let's learn the main steps for this process in this post, explained stage by stage in detail.

## Launch the App

The first step is downloading and installing the software into your device. For this, go to the official website of Wondershare Filmora 11 and click on the Free Download button at the top of the screen. Depending on your device's operating system, i.e., macOS or Windows, the relevant software installer will download automatically into your device.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![relevant software installer will download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-1.jpg)

You must click on the installed APK file and double-click the Agree button for the process to continue. After you carry out the instructions that appear, the software will begin installing into your device. Wait for the software to install completely, and then the main homepage will open automatically on your screen.

![the homepage will open automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-2.jpg)

Make sure that the software is in the 11.3.0 or higher version. Because the feature for audio visualization will not work on any of the older software versions. So, if you have the Filmora9 software, upgrade it to the Wondershare Filmora 11.

![upgrade to filmora 11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-3.jpg)

## Add the music file

Next, you should click on the "Create New Project" button from the homepage. Then, tap on the "Click here to import media" section when it opens and add the file to the software window from your internal storage.

You can also click on the My Media tab and choose Project Media. Go to All Templates and download the audio track you will make changes to. Then, drag the audio file you have imported down to the editor timeline. Add a stock image from your Stock Media section.

![drag the audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-4.jpg)

You can also add another pre-made background cover image that you created beforehand from the device, if available. Drag that to the editor timeline as well above the song clip you moved there and tap on the slider. Pull the slider to fit the full size of the audio length for the background alignment. Right-click on the file, and the editing window will open for basic video editing. Make changes like adjusting the Scale, Position, Opacity, etc. Press OK.

![make changes like adjusting the scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-5.jpg)

## Add the Audio Visualizer Effects

Next, you should go to the Effects tab. When this window opens, you should tap on the Filmstock tab beside the Default one for advanced features like Audio Visualizer. Click on it next.

When you tap on it, you see a list of different visualizer effects in a collection. Please choose one of them that you prefer and download it.

![tap on the filmstock tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-6.jpg)

After that, you must drag the visualizer effect selected from the collection to the editing timeline above the background image you added previously. Again, use the slider on the clip to drag it forward and fit the size of both the music clip and the image.

## Edit the Audio Visualiser

The next step of the process that you must focus on is editing the audio visualizer properly for the song and its background cover. For this, you must double-click on the audio visualizer effect you dropped in the timeline- this will open the editing window for the clip.

Here, make some changes to the quality of the audio visualizer as you prefer. Adjustment options available here include position, scale, Opacity, and Intensity. Drag the sliders for them to adjust the visualizer effect as needed. Change the color of the visualizer as well from here, and then use the slider on the visualizer effect on the timeline to see the effect change. Press the OK button after you are done.

## Add the Portrait Image

Go to the My Media tab next to get the Portrait image into the project. If you previously imported the image to Filmora, drag it to the timeline. Or, you can add it later by clicking on the Import Media button and adding the Portrait photo from your device.

When it is available on the media window, hold, drag, and then drop it above the visualizer. Like in the case of the previous parts, use the slider end of this image in the timeline to drag it and fit the size of the other clips.

![adding the portrait image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-8.jpg)

Select Audio Visualizer and click on the circular visualizer effect from the list. Repeat the dragging and dropping step for this effect as well.

On the timeline, you have to adjust the visualizer effect over the portrait photo to match the length of the previous clips. Then, please tap on the portrait photo in the timeline again and adjust its appearance, like reducing the image size to fit the second visualizer effect size.

![reduce size of image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-10.jpg)

Choose the Rectangle option, for example, and move it to the side of the screen. Click on the shape editing option and adjust the border size of it to three.

If you want to create a rounded-off edge look to the rectangle shape, tap on the small yellow icon that you will see at its edge. Move it slightly to adjust.

There are a lot of individuals out there who want to know what the most exemplary video editing application for Mac is. Well, it all relies on what you need to accomplish. Do you need free video editing software? Are you planning to use the software for business or solely for personal use as a pastime?

You may need to get your hands on the most complex video editing software you can access on Mac, or you might prefer something simple to use and free to install. There is no need to worry because I will usher you through some of these below.

We've conducted a significant study into what some believe to be the video editing programs currently available for Mac, and we're ready to share what we've discovered.

**Getting Started**

It can be challenging to locate a video editing app that meets your requirements. It's simple to see why: software developers are torn between making home films and developing Hollywood-quality films.

The finest applications don't force you to pick between "powerful" and "easy-to-use" instead of focusing on providing you with tools to help you accomplish your vision while being intuitive and simple to use.

Keep reading as I show you the best MP4 video editing software that is available on Mac:

### **How to Edit MP4 Video in Filmora**

You never know what you'll want in the video editing room, and that is why you must equip yourself thoroughly for all of the obstacles that will arise during the video editing process. Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.

To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:

1. **Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio**

When you're ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora's desktop icon. The software's greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-2.jpg)

1. **Make a New Project**

Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software's welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora's video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg)

Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You'll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.

1. **Import Your Files**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-4.jpg)

Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.

1. **Organize Your Clips**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-5.jpg)

Filmora's Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.

1. **Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don't belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-6.jpg)

To evaluate the video clips you've uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.

1. **Apply Visual Effects**

You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora's many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-7.jpg)

If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text /Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the required text.

1. **Export Your Final Output**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-8.jpg)

Hit the Export button when you're sure there's nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.

Choose the type that better serves the project you're working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.

Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you'll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.

## **#2: iMovie**

**It is available in Windows and Mac OS.**

This software is a consumer-grade video editor that is available for free. Users who would like to produce videos with material from their Photos library quickly will benefit from the app. iMovie has a more straightforward timeline editor that excludes multi-track editing to make things easier.

Picture-in-picture video and slow-motion or fast-forward special effects are also supported. With iMovie, you can create titles, drag-and-drop effects, and insert motion graphics like 3D globes or travel maps. You can find ready-to-use music and sound effects in the program.

## **FAQ**

### **Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid MP4 Editor?**

If you need to work on videos on a regular basis, or if you wish to edit films for your own Facebook or Instagram use, paid software is probably not necessary. However, keep in mind that video editor tools cannot compete with paid software. Based on our own experience, they're generally limited in terms of capabilities and performance, and they often have other annoyances like advertisements or export restrictions.

That said, if you simply need to make minor edits or aren't planning on editing films for a long time, the most exemplary free video editing programs listed above can be handy. However, if you use video editing software regularly or for work, I strongly advise you to invest in professional video editing software.

### **What Editing Tools Do Professionals Use?**

Several people are curious about the software used by professionals. On the other hand, professional editors use various tools to improve their video editing productivity.

### **How to Edit MP4 Video in Filmora**

You never know what you'll want in the video editing room, and that is why you must equip yourself thoroughly for all of the obstacles that will arise during the video editing process. Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.

To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:

1. **Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio**

When you're ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora's desktop icon. The software's greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-2.jpg)

1. **Make a New Project**

Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software's welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora's video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg)

Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You'll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.

1. **Import Your Files**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-4.jpg)

Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.

1. **Organize Your Clips**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-5.jpg)

Filmora's Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.

1. **Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don't belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-6.jpg)

To evaluate the video clips you've uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.

1. **Apply Visual Effects**

You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora's many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-7.jpg)

If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text /Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the required text.

1. **Export Your Final Output**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-8.jpg)

Hit the Export button when you're sure there's nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.

Choose the type that better serves the project you're working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.

Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you'll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.

### **How to Edit MP4 Video in Filmora**

You never know what you'll want in the video editing room, and that is why you must equip yourself thoroughly for all of the obstacles that will arise during the video editing process. Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.

To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:

1. **Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio**

When you're ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora's desktop icon. The software's greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-2.jpg)

1. **Make a New Project**

Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software's welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora's video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg)

Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You'll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.

1. **Import Your Files**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-4.jpg)

Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.

1. **Organize Your Clips**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-5.jpg)

Filmora's Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.

1. **Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don't belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-6.jpg)

To evaluate the video clips you've uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.

1. **Apply Visual Effects**

You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora's many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-7.jpg)

If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text /Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the required text.

1. **Export Your Final Output**

![mp4-video-editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-8.jpg)

Hit the Export button when you're sure there's nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.

Choose the type that better serves the project you're working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.

Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you'll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.

## **#2: iMovie**

**It is available in Windows and Mac OS.**

This software is a consumer-grade video editor that is available for free. Users who would like to produce videos with material from their Photos library quickly will benefit from the app. iMovie has a more straightforward timeline editor that excludes multi-track editing to make things easier.

That said, if you simply need to make minor edits or aren't planning on editing films for a long time, the most exemplary free video editing programs listed above can be handy.

## Part 1: What is Time Lapse?

### 1\. Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography

Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).

Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.

The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 = RT

### 2\. What is a Time-lapse video used for?

The use of time-lapse photography and video is an excellent storytelling technique since compelling stories are essential to effective marketing. A time-lapse can also offer excellent insight into the advancement of developmental projects.

#### **①** Scientific research

* Time-lapses may be utilized to spread the word about scientific investigations to a wide audience. You can use time-lapse photography to gain money by selling the material of interesting scientific investigations to documentary makers or instructional websites.
* Scientists can visualize processes that would be challenging or sometimes even impossible to study in real life, thanks to time-lapse photography

#### **②** Individual enjoyment

Time-lapses are also utilized by filmmakers for scenes requiring extended durations of time with little significant activity occurring during the shot (such as night slowly turning into day).

#### **③** **Commercial use**

* Time-lapse videos are a wonderful instrument for enhancing the perception of your brand because they are. As a result, many consumers find it interesting.
* Time-lapse videos are the epitome of the old saying that "good things come in small packages" for any brand.

### 3\. How to Make a Time-lapse video?

Start with a stable tripod or surface and adjust the settings on your phone camera or DSLR. Use slow shutter speed, use still mode, and don’t forget to use the timer. Find a stable surface and place your camera this way, you can get your hands on a creative time-lapse video.

## Part 2: Record or Shoot Your Time-Lapse Video

### 1\. Select Your Subject

The best way to create a time-lapse video is to pick your subject very carefully. Movement is the most crucial factor to consider while selecting a time-lapse subject. Any movement—whether it be caused by people, animals, vehicles, water, clouds, or anything else—can create an exciting and captivating time-lapse.

* Some of the iconic ideas of filming a time-lapse include:
* A stunning glimpse of the day and night cycle of life at sea.
* Construction of a building from ground till its completion
* Capturing the traffic movement
* Ice melting
* Sun setting
* A great shot of a galaxy

### 2\. Prepare Right Equipment

Choose your equipment before heading out to capture time lapses. There are several options available for time-lapse cameras and applications, ranging from basic and affordable to sophisticated and pricy.

#### **①** **Camera**

You cannot make a time-lapse without owning a camera, whether it is a mobile phone, a compact, or a DSLR. The quality of the final result will be as good as the quality of the equipment you use.

**\- Smartphone camera apps (iPhone/Android)**

All good smartphones now possess a built-in camera with good optical quality, for example: recently Apple Company launched its new iPhone 14 with a magnificent 48-megapixel camera. By using such cameras we have been able to produce really good pictures, although not in negative conditions, such as those with low-light, etc.

For apple: use IguanaLapse or TimeLapse to create your great time-lapses

For Android: use Time-Lapse – Lite

\- **Point-and-shoot cameras**

Even though smartphone cameras have taken over in this digital era, it is still not possible to say that point-and-shoot cameras are not doing their magic. A point-and-shoot camera is really handy.

The action camera is usually mounted to your helmet, chest, handlebars of a bike or motorcycle, or tripod to record life.

The best action cameras for creating time-lapses include GoPro Hero11 Black, Insta360 ONE RS Twin Edition, DJI Action 2, DJI Pocket 2, and GoPro Hero9 Black.

This is the best choice in terms of cost/benefit: it produces excellent results and high image quality. The best and top-rated DSLRs for creating terrific time-lapses include Nikon D850, Canon 80D, Canon EOS 90D, Sony A7 III, and others.

#### **②** Tripod/Gimbal/other stabilizers

Owning a solid and stable tripod is essential for the success of a time-lapse video. A good tripod will support the load without any problems and will keep the arsenal stable for the duration of the shooting session. The best way to use a tripod for filming a time-lapse is to use orient on a tripod that is quite high (at least 170cm).

Some best tripods used to record time-lapses include BONFOTO B671c, Patekfly Flexible Tripod, Sirui Easy Traveler ET-2204, and Vanguard Alta Pro 263AB 100.

A gimbal is a tool that uses motors and intelligent sensors to support and stabilize a camera. The best gimbal and other stabilizers used to film time-lapses include Moza Air 2, DJI RS 2, Zhiyun Crane-2S, Benro RedDog R1, iKan EC1 Beholder, and Feiyu AK4500.

#### **③** Intervalometer/other camera shutter triggers

An intervalometer is a small device able to trigger the shutter of your camera every ‘n’ second, ‘n’ times (also infinite). It can be external, or as we saw earlier, integrated into the camera.

A **PowerPoint Looping slideshow** automatically starts over from the beginning after displaying the last slide. A particular slide is displayed for a certain amount of time interval. Once the time has elapsed, the slide automatically moves to the next one. It is sometimes used in seminars to keep the audience busy before the main presentation commences. In most tradeshows, the videos or information you notice repeatedly playing on its own are in a loop. The transition and slide sets get tweaked to work that way. In Nigeria, most banks use looped slides to display their welcome message. Looping slides make display work more accessible and give time to face other activities while your slide runs automatically.

01 [Advantages of PowerPoint looping slide](#Part 1)

02 [How to loop a PowerPoint in simple steps.](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **Advantages of PowerPoint Looping Slide.**

PowerPoint slideshows aid and develop visual resources. Looping a PowerPoint slideshowmakes a presentation more accessible and more attractive. Studies show that humans tend to remember more of what they see than what they hear. You should use a **PowerPoint-loop slideshow** if you want to make a lasting impression while holding that conference, pitch to your boss at work, or even bid for that project**.** Here are some other reasons you should consider looping in your nextPowerPoint slide show.

A looping PowerPoint slideshow runs automatically. A typical PowerPoint presentation moves to the next slide when the presenter clicks the mouse, but a **looping slideshow** does not need human participation. It displays the next slide automatically after the time interval has elapsed.

It can be helpful to welcome guests to a meeting or Newcomers to an office reception area.

It ensures that latecomers do not miss any significant part of the presentation because a **PowerPoint automatic slideshow loop** starts all over again after displaying the last slide.

Setting up a **looping slideshow** is easy and does not require much equipment. You're all set to go if you have a computer and projector.

It gives the speaker more time to focus on the audience and interact with them rather than concentrating on getting the next slide correctly.

With or without the presence of an operator, the PowerPoint presentation can display the slides configured to display.

It saves you the stress of arranging and rearranging slides during a meeting or an event.

It makes presentation easy and allows the large audience to flow with the speaker as they do not have to read from documents while trying to keep up with the speaker.

A PowerPoint configured to loop continuously can be used to pass general information.

Not everyone likes speaking in public or making a presentation in front of a large crowd. Someone like me immediately starts sweating profusely and has heart palpitations when many eyes are on me. In this kind of situation, a **looped PowerPoint slideshow** helps take the tension off a nervous speaker as the audience will most likely be concentrating on the slideshows instead of you.

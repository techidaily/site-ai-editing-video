## [Step by Step] to Rotate Video in Google Photos

Google photos let you store, view, edit and share your videos and photos and are automatically organized. It is a very great cloud storage service and most people use it. Google Photos has introduced an artificial intelligence technology into the app. That’s why it can automatically organize and rotate.

You have videos on google photos that are automatically rotated, others are not.

How do you rotate them manually?

It’s is so simple and will not take much of your time.

Let’s dive in…

## **Rotating videos in google photos**

Rotating a video in google photos is pretty simple and will not take much of your time. You can easily fix the rotation and aspect ratio of your videos. But it’s a little tricky.

I'm going to show you how to flip your videos from portrait mode to landscape mode or from landscape mode to portrait mode.

You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you're going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-1.png)

You will see a diamond with a circular arrow on it. You're going to hit that until you find the way you want it to be.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-2.png)

Once you're happy, in the top right hand corner, hit Save Copy and that's it, the size of the file determines how long it takes to finish this process later.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-3.png)

## **An easier way to rotate videos in Google Photos**

If you just need to rotate a video in portrait mode to the landscape mode or 180 degrees, Google photos will be the best choice to do that. However, what if rotate a video 32 degrees or 157 degrees, or maybe you need to do more editing operations, you can’t rely on Google Photos anymore.

But stop worrying, you can set your video at any angle with [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . It is one of the best video editing software that provides you with the editing tools you need to edit and share your videos across the globe. It allows you to flip and rotate the orientation of the video. It also supports many popular formats used on different social media platforms like Linkedin, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and so many more.

Let’s have look at this professionally designed software that everyone can master in a few minutes and can film professional videos. Since it provides all the features that you will need to make movies in a good way. Moreover, its interface is very simple to use.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Here’s How to do it…

### Rotate video at any angle

You can also rotate the video by using the **Transform** tab located at the top right corner.

* Drag your video into the **timeline**.
* Double click on the video to bring up the **editing panel**.
* Hit the **basic** tab under the **video** tab in the menu bar.
* Select the **Transform**
* Click the **rotate**
* Here you can move the rotate slider or directly enter the rotating value.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-4.png)

You will notice that I have changed the rotation of my video from its original position to the rotated angle.

You can rotate upside down, rotate left, rotate right or 90 degrees clockwise, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, 360 degrees rotate, and back to the original. Check the video result in the preview window. Once you get satisfied with the rotation.

* Hit the **ok**
* Select the **save**

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-5.png)

Similarly, you can drag the video from the preview panel and adjust it as required.

Here, you can **Flip** function your video to change the direction. Like in this screenshot, suppose you want to change the place from right to left. You can easily change the direction by hitting on the flip tab.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-6.png)

Now you can see that the image has flipped without making a big effort you can also do it. I have done it for you, you are smarter.

Just go ahead and start…

 Scale is also used to remove the unwanted and rubbish scenes from the selected video. Like if you don’t want to show something behind the scene, you can use the scale function to cut that scene from your video.

## Learn to Use Montage with These Movies

As with many new things in life, Montage isn't your best friend right off the bat. So, if you want to learn to use montages with movies, they need to be the right ones. If you don't know what Montage is, it is a way of compressing an action or series of actions into a short amount of time. We look at movies because they are a common type of entertainment everyone has seen before, which makes them easier to understand as a concept.

Using Montage is a great way to create engaging video content. There are many people interested in the topic of Montage, so if you get that video out there, you can easily find an audience. When used in conjunction with YouTube advertising, creating videos about Montage could be an excellent business idea for you.

Learning how to use Montage properly can be challenging. The process isn't intuitive, and using it can feel like hiding random pieces around your page. But, when you watch the right movies, they can help you understand how to use this tool effectively. So, take some time, check out these movies, and learn how to get the most out of Montage!

## What Is A Montage?

The definition of a montage is a "series of short scenes or episodes forming a unified whole." That definition can lead to different interpretations of a montage and can be applied to any art medium. A "montage" isn't just for movies. Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.

If you've seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you've probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.

## Purpose of Montage

Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project. Even though these types of movies have become a common genre, there's a list of reasons why this is popular in movies today.

* Montage has several uses in movies. Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm. These different uses of Montage do come with their styles, but they all share a few common traits.
* They're often used to condense periods of storytime into much smaller but more entertaining segments. The word montage is French for "to construct from many parts ."Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.
* This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them. A great example of a montage was used in Rocky when Rocky was training for his fight with Apollo Creed.
* A montage allows filmmakers to explore a theme using several sequential shots that can't be covered in a single shot.

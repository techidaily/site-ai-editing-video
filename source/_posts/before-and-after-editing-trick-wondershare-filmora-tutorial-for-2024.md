## Before & After Editing Trick | Wondershare Filmora Tutorial

How do travel vloggers instantly grab everyone's attention with their magical content? The unique animation preset is the answer. Video makers use them to morph video clips into scenic views that make viewers' jaws drop in awe. Also, these edits can cover up any flaws made during the production of the original video clip. Isn’t it cool?

You might be wondering how to add these effects to the video. Keep reading to discover some of the simplest effects that are bound to add soul to your content. Before diving into the details, let’s first understand these effects.

## Part 1\. What are the before/after effects?

After-effects are visual effects that are used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of videos. You might have encountered these effects several times during watching YouTube videos or movies. These transitions make the videos more appealing to the audience.

In films, for example, the dissolve effect is employed to signify a time change. It informs viewers that there is a time difference between the two shots. You can see how this effect is used to dissolve one scene into another in the video clip mentioned below.

![dissolve effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-1.gif)

The history of after-effects can be traced back to 1993\. These effects enabled the crew to mix 3D and 2D images to produce virtual dinosaur motion visuals in the Jurassic Park film, which we all love. Now that you have a fundamental understanding of the origins of after-effects, let's take a look at where they might be applied!

## Part 2\. Where can you use these before/after effects?

If you are a fan of fiction movies, then you must have noticed that some of their scenes though fake, look so realistic that they blow our minds. And now you might have an idea of how these shots are created!

Whether it be shooting a movie or a commercial, these transitions have the power to make our content irresistible. Once you are familiar with the purpose of these after-effects, it’s time to show you how you can edit your videos using these effects.

## Part 3\. How to edit your videos using before/after effects?

If you're new to editing and don't know much about video graphics, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor is the finest platform for you. It is not only easier to use but also more entertaining than other online video editors. Filmora is a free video editor that is accessible for both Windows and macOS.

### Steps for installing the Filmora video editor

To install the Filmora video editor, follow these steps

Step1 Go to the official site of Filmora.

Step2 Click on the download button.

Step3 Install the application on your PC.

Step4 Now, you can use the Filmora video editor to beautify your content.

Now, let's explore some of the coolest transition effects that you can use in your videos for before and after comparison.

## Part 4\. Filmora's top three transition effects for beginners

Wondershare Filmora can help video editors achieve their goals in the most basic and economical fashion. The best three transition effects that may completely transform your videos are shown below.

### Wipe Effect

Wipe transition is used to produce an apparent transformation to videos with similar frames for the before/after comparison. Travel vloggers mostly use this effect to create a retro vibe in their videos. This transition is frequently used in movies to demonstrate the influence of time on any place.

The wipe effect's fundamental goal is to transition from one shot into another via a sliding animation, giving the video an elegant vibe. For instance, we can use the wipe effect to convert the raw film to colored corrected footage.

#### Steps to apply the Wipe effect

Step1 Drag and drop the video clip 'before color correction' onto the timeline's first video track.

![drag and drop the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-2.jpg)

Step2 Then, drag and drop the color-corrected video clip on the second video track. Ensure that the clips are piled on top of one another so they may all be played simultaneously. It will make it easier for us to trim the footage.

![drag and drop the color-corrected video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-3.jpg)

Step3 Place the play head where we want the transformation to begin. Then trim the second clip.

![place the play](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-4.jpg)

Step4 Go to the Transitions window and select "Erase slide." Drag the transition to the start of the second video clip. Then, double-click the transition on the timeline to open the settings box.

![go to the transitions window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-5.jpg)

Step5 Adjust the length of the "Erase slide." Let's see how it turns out!

![adjust the length of the erase slide](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-6.gif)

### Dissolve Effect

The dissolve effect allows us to shift from one shot to another by using slow block dissolution. It gives the impression that one scene is being morphed into another. And, it is frequently used in documentaries.

We may utilize the dissolve transition to display the differences between two video segments more naturally. To explain the objective of the dissolve effect, we used two clips of the same place shot at separate times. The first film is current, but the second is from the same place but was taken a few years back.

**Steps to apply the Dissolve effect**

Step1 Drag and drop the first video clip onto the timeline's first video track.

![drag and drop the first video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-7.jpg)

Step2 Then, on the second video track, drag and drop the second video clip. Make sure the start of the second clip is where you want the transition to begin.

![drag and drop the second video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-8.jpg)

Step3 Then Go to the Transitions window and choose the "Dissolve" effect.

![choose the dissolve effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-9.jpg)

Step4 Drag the transition to the start of the second video clip.

![drag the transition to the start of the second video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-10.jpg)

Step5 Then, on the timeline, double-click the transition to open the settings box. If necessary, adjust the duration of the "Dissolve " effect as needed.

![double-click the transition to open the settings box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-11.jpg)

You can see how it looks in the image below. If we play the timeline, we can watch the green court convert into the old basketball court. However, the two visuals don't truly match each other during the transformation.

##### Steps to adjust the frames of the clips

Step1 We may fix it by adjusting the location and scale of the clips.

Step2 Move the play head to the transition section to watch both video segments.

Step3 To open the settings window, double-click on the first video.

Step4 Find the transform section and scale it to 110%.

Step5 Then, move the first video's frame to match the second video's placement. We may notice a more natural transition when we replay the timeline.

### Split Screen Effect

The split-screen technique first appeared in the film "The Queen of Spades," which was released in 1949\. It depicted a man suffering from a psychological illness. The split-screen effect was used to demonstrate the contrast between reality and his hallucinations. It made the viewer more aware of what was actually happening in the film.

![split screen effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-12.jpg)

Since then, the split screen has been used as the simplest technique to demonstrate the before/after comparison. This effect is also ideal for emphasizing the changes in only one section of the video.

Because the split screen effect does not display the whole frame of the video clips, you may eliminate the top and bottom bars of the video clips using this effect.

**How to apply a split screen effect?**

Step1 Find "Split Screen1" in the window by clicking "Split Screen."

Step2 Drag it over to the timeline.

Step3 You'll see the split-screen template in the preview box when you double-click it.

![split-screen template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-13.jpg)

Step4 Drag the two video clips you wish to compare to the template's left and right sides.

![drag the two video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-14.gif)

Step5 If necessary, you may also adjust the location of the videos in the preview clip.

Step6 Finally, uncheck the option labeled "allow split screen animation."

![uncheck the option labeled allow split screen animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-15.gif)

Step7 All of the steps for the before/after split screen are now complete.

Step8 Let's wait and see how it turns out!

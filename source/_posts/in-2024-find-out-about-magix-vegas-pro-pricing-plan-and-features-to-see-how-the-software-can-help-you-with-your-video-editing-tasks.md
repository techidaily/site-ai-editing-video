## Looking for Simple Steps to Customize the Speed of Your Video in DaVinci Resolve? Find Out How You Can Do that and Discover an Easier Alternative to DaVinci Resolve

Slow-motion videos are in trend on social media platforms. You can shoot the footage in slow-motion mode or slow it down while editing the video. Similarly, if you are making a funny video, there are surely going to be parts where the video speeds up. Sped-up video clips have always been part of comic relief and entertainment for the audience. You will need a feature-rich video editor to customize the speed of your video.

DaVinci Resolve has established itself as a complete video editor. You can edit your video, correct the color, add visual effects and edit audio parts. You can undoubtedly change video speed in DaVinci Resolve. However, DaVinci Resolve's user interface is slightly complex for beginners. We will instruct on how you can speed up a video using DaVinci Resolve. We will also suggest you an easier alternative if you are not in favor of DaVinci Resolve.

## Part I. What are the Scenarios When You Need to Speed Up Video?

There are several scenarios when speeding up a video becomes a necessity. Here are the most probable ones that you can relate to.

**Boring But Necessary Parts** \- There could be some sections in a long video that are necessary but boring to watch. You can't bore your viewers and let them leave your video midway. Hence, you can speed up those sections to pass them away quickly.

**Funny Videos** \- The subject's actions in the video look very funny when you speed them up. Therefore, if you make funny videos to entertain your viewers, speeding up certain sections of your video with funny audio in the background should be a regular thing.

**Short Videos** \- Short-duration videos are extremely popular on social media platforms.

People upload them as Stories and Statuses to entertain their followers regularly. Therefore, a sped-up video can shorten the duration, accommodate the necessary content, and fit the video duration requirements of the respective social media platforms.

**Timelapse** \- Timelapse videos are a treat to watch. You can shoot the video in timelapse mode or speed up the video while editing. That is how you can fit hours of a video into a few minutes or seconds of video duration.

## Part II. Speed Up Video using DaVinci Resolve

DaVinci Resolve is a professional video editor where you can change your video's speed in several ways. You can instantly change your video clip's speed by mentioning the speed in terms of percentage.

You can also use the advanced Speed Ramp option to customize the video speed unevenly. Besides, there are retime curves to adjust the video speed at your convenience. Let us go through the detailed guide on how to speed up the video in DaVinci Resolve 17.

### Method 1\. Change Clip Speed Option

The simplest way is through the Change Clip Speed option. You can explicitly mention the speed percentage as needed. To speed it up, mention speed percentage above 100\. If you want to slow it down, the speed percentage will be below 100\. Here are the steps you need to execute.

Step1 After you have placed the video clip onto the timeline, select the clip and right-click on it.

![placed the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

Step2 Tap "Change Clip Speed…" option.

![change clip speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-2.jpg)

Step3 Once the Change Clip Speed dialog box opens, modify the speed from 100% to something higher if you want to speed it up.

![once the change clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

Step4 Click on the Change button when you are happy with the result.

### Method 2\. Speed Ramping Option

Speed ramping is a process where you can vary the speed of your video unevenly. It means you can speed up some portions while slowing down others. This is achieved through retime controls that let you edit the video clips in sections using speed points. Here are the steps to illustrate the process.

Step1 Right-click the video clip on your timeline. From the menu, select the Retime Controls option.

![video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

Step2 Move the play head where you want to change the speed. Click the arrow next to 100% and select the Add Speed Point option. Similarly, move the play head to another point and add a new speed point.

![change the speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-5.jpg)

Step3 Click on the arrow next to 100% to change the speed between two-speed points. Go to the Change Speed option and select from the preset. Based on your preset speed selection, the video's speed within the speed points will change.

## Part 1 **What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?**

**AI Video Recognition** is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.

In todayâs world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.

Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.

Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways **AI video recognition** works:

**â** Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video

**â** Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video

**â** Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video

**â** Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest

**â** Tracking of Object: It can track the objectâs trajectory, which will change in the video.

![what is ai video recognition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/deep-learning-of-ai-video-recognition-2.jpg)

## Part 2 **Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?**

**Video recognition AI** primarily focuses on comprehending the information or data received from many video feeds, frame by frame. It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.

Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual's face's digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.

![ai video recognition and facial recognition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/deep-learning-of-ai-video-recognition-3.png)

## Part 1 **What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?**

**AI Video Recognition** is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.

In todayâs world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.

Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.

Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways **AI video recognition** works:

**â** Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video

**â** Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video

**â** Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video

**â** Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest

**â** Tracking of Object: It can track the objectâs trajectory, which will change in the video.

## Part 2 **Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?**

**Video recognition AI** primarily focuses on comprehending the information or data received from many video feeds, frame by frame. It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.

Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual's face's digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.

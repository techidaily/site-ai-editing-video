## Part 1 **What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?**

**AI Video Recognition** is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.

In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.

Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.

Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways **AI video recognition** works:

**●** Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video

02 [Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?](#Part 2)

03 [Understanding 6 Top Video Recognition Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?**

**AI Video Recognition** is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.

In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.

Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.

Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways **AI video recognition** works:

**●** Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video

**●** Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video

**●** Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video

**●** Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest

**●** Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.

![what is ai video recognition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/deep-learning-of-ai-video-recognition-2.jpg)

## Part 2 **Difference Between AI Video Recognition and Facial Recognition?**

**Video recognition AI** primarily focuses on comprehending the information or data received from many video feeds, frame by frame. It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.

Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual's face's digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.

1. [RE: Vision Effects ReelSmart Motion Blur](#part2-1)
2. [CC Force Motion Blur](#part2-2)
3. [Pixel Motion Blur](#part2-3)

* [RSMB vs. CC Force vs. Pixel: Which is the Best Motion Blur Plugin?](#part3)

## Part 1: What is Motion Blur?

If you have captured a video where you want to show the movement of a certain train, car, or any object, motion blur can smooth it naturally. If you want to show the rapid movement of fast-moving objects, the motion blur effect can enhance this motion flawlessly.

Through this effect, you can smoothen your video by adding a realistic touch to it. By doing so, you can effectively put an emphasis on any particular area in the video. Many people add this effect to racing games to add a sense of speed realistically. Hence, the motion blur effect is commonly used by video creators and editors to prevent their videos from having a choppy or unprofessional look.

![motion blur explained](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-plugin-for-ae-2.jpg)

## Part 2: 3 Motion Blur Plugins for Adobe Effects

Are you ready to use the **best motion blur plugin of After Effects**? In this section, we will discuss the top 3 motion blur plugins that can help you to create a motion blur effect in After Effects.

### 1\. RE: Vision Effects ReelSmart Motion Blur

RSMB is a powerful motion blur plugin that contains various advanced features. By adding this motion blur plugin, you can instantly add a motion blur effect to your videos without any manual effort. Moreover, within this tool, you can also adjust the amount of blur that you want to apply to your video. You can also generate compelling effects using RSMB by blurring a sequence of motion, preferably.

**Price:** For After Effects, the regular version costs about $109.95\. Whereas for the Pro version, the cost is $169.95.

**Download:** ReelSmart shows great compatibility with popular software such as Premiere Pro, After Effects, and many more. However, the subscription and download plans for each software are different. So, if you want to learn more about this plugin, you can navigate to its [official website](https://revisionfx.com/products/rsmb/premiere-pro/).

**Key Features**

* RSMB uses automatic tracking for each pixel so that the motion blur effect can be applied with great precision.
* You can adjust the amount and strength of motion blur through this plugin.
* With the help of advanced technology, RSMB can use the technique of object separation. Through this capability, the plugin can easily separate background and foreground efficiently.
* You can also use RSMB to track 360 footages for adding motion blur. Due to its advanced algorithms, it easily adds a motion blur effect to 360 videos by considering the sides, bottoms, tops, and edges.

**What We Like**

* RSMB can use spline guidance that can help you to animate shapes to display the movement of the objects. Thus, even if this plugin encounters tracking problems, you can always guide the object’s movement.
* Apart from adding a motion blur effect, you can also use RSMB to remove this blur effect without compromising the quality of your video.

**What We Don’t Like**

* A wide range of advanced features is only available in the pro version of RSMB. Thus, it can be expensive for beginner users.

### 2\. CC Force Motion Blur

You can find the CC Force Motion Blur plugin under the time category of the Effects tab. By using this effect, you can add a natural sense of motion to your video easily.

In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.

Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.

Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.

Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:

\- Scale the video up or down

\- Flip the video horizontally or vertically

\- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport

## Sync Audio With Video With Filmora

Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it's not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

That's why in this brief guide, we'll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio & video when a single camera can record both. So let's first answer this simple question.

## Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio & Video?

Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can't expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That's why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.

You might think it's an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.

![recording audio and video separately for higher quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg)

But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don't do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn't it?

Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let's first see what preparations we need. After that, we'll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let's begin our journey.

## Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording

You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It's to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.

And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.

![a clapper board used to start a film scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/film-start-clapper-board.jpg)

Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It's best to clap before you say "Action" or speak so that it's easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a **Tail Slate**!!!

After you've recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world's leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let's move forward and see how to sync audio with video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 3: How To Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora

As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let's start with the manual process first.

### Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora

##### Step1Download & install

If you haven't downloaded the latest version of Filmora yet, click the button below to download it without any cost. And after the download is completed, you can install it on your device right away.

##### Step2Import your files

The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the "New Project" button from the opening interface.

![click on the new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-a-new-project-on-filmora.jpg)

![import your media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Prepare your files

Now, it's time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the "Import Media" section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.

![drag the media files to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/drag-the-media-files-to-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step4Sync the audio & video files using the audio spike

Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you'll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we'll see a spike.

**_Bonus Tip:_** _If you can't find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier._

![find the sound spike on video and audio files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg)

Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.

![align the sound spikes with each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/align-the-sound-spikes-with-each-other.jpg)

That's it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let's see how to do it now.

##### Step5Remove the audio from the video footage

To detach the audio in the video footage, right-click on this file and select the "Detach Audio" option. Or you can also use the "Ctrl+Alt+D" as the hotkey.

![detach audio from video file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-from-video-file.jpg)

Once the audio file has been separated, you can move forward and delete it. To delete this audio, right-click on it and select "Delete."

![delete the detached audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/delete-the-detached-audio.jpg)

##### Step6Enjoy your video with the new audio track

So here we go. Our video file has been synced with the high-quality audio file. You can now hit the Export button to get this edited file. But wait a minute. Didn't we say we'll show you a method to automatically sync audio with video? Let's start this method now.

![find the sound spike on video and audio files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg)

Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.

![align the sound spikes with each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/align-the-sound-spikes-with-each-other.jpg)

### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

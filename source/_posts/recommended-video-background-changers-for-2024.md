## **What is a Video Background Changer?**

A video background changer is a tool that can swap the background of any video. These tools usually work in three simple steps.

* Analyze the footage.
* Separate the subject or “subjects” from the background
* Switch backgrounds.

The process starts when a user uploads a video clip. The tool analyzes the footage and separates the subjects from the background. The user can select other available pre-made backgrounds or upload a preferred one to the platform. After this process, users can share the finished video or save it to their devices. Other kinds of background changers only merge a transparent clip with a background.

## Steps to Create Green Screen Videos in After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

**What Comes First – Script or Storyboard?**

Before beginning to comment on the sequence of the aforesaid elements within a film production process, let us first proceed to have an understanding of the terms in a fundamental sense.

**How Can I Get Better at Storyboarding?**

Speaking in the light of film production assets and utilities, storyboarding is more of a creative art rather than a customary process or production stage. While it requires consistent effort and practice to master the craft, adhering to some handy tips and tricks can be of great help to improve your skills at creating expressive and finely detailed storyboards.

**●** **Stop Aiming to Become a Perfectionist**

Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.

**●** **Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels**

**●** **Explore Your Imagination**

Your storyboard happens to be the inaugural representation of your video production idea and script in front of the potential audience. You should hence, proceed with the latter’s crafting process while keeping a close reference with the drafted script. Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.

**●** **Feedback Has a Great Importance**

This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.

**●** **Enjoy Your Work**

Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience.

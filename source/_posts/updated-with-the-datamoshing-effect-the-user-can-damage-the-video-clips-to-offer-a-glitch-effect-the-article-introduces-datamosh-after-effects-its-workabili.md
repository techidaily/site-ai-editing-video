## With the Datamoshing Effect, the User Can Damage the Video Clips to Offer a Glitch Effect. The Article Introduces Datamosh After Effects Its Workability in the Industry

Experimenting with new effects and filters has become part and parcel of life, especially for creative professionals. Datamoshing is a similar effect that displays errors and flaws in the video clips to leave an impression on the audience. In most terms, the datamoshing effect shares similarities with the glitch effect.

Henceforth, the write-up shall focus on the introduction of this effect along with its workability. The procedure to create datamosh After Effects would also be covered. So, let us begin!

#### In this article

01 [What is the Datamoshing Effect?](#part1)

02 [How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?](#part2)

03 [Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)](#part3)

04 [How to Do Datamoshing Effect with Datamosh Plugin in After Effects](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Datamoshing Effect?

Before going into the depths of workability and operation of the datamoshing effect in After Effects, let us understand the effect in detail. The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.

In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.

Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.

## Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?

The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.

Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.

The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.

The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.

The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.

## Part 3: Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)

Understanding the datamosh After Effects is one thing, and incorporating it in your footage is another. The section shall walk you through the step-by-step guide to create the After Effects' datamoshing effect without a plugin. So, let's go, shall we?

### Step 1: Preliminary Process

The first step is easy. Open After Effects from your system. Import the targeted video that needs the datamosh effect. After that, head to the "Content-Aware Fill" to begin the process.

![tap on content aware fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Creating the Reference Frame

Use the playhead where you wish to create the effect, and then click on "Create Reference Frame." The picture frame opens in Photoshop, and the user is expected to save it. Now, go back to the After Effects.

![create reference frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Smearing Process

Now, hide the top layer so that the smearing can occur. Turn the Masks to "None" so that you can perform the masking. Split the second layer to duplicate the layer as we make changes to it. Set the "Masks" to "Subtract and then add a refine soft matte.

![ smearing process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-3.jpg)

### Step 4: Pre-composing the Clip

It is important to pre-compose the clip, so right-click on the timeline and hit "Pre-compose" to the menu list that appears. Tick mark "Move all attributes into the new composition" and rename the clip afterward. Hit "OK."

![pre-compose clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Rendering Queue

Double-click on the timeline, hold shift and drag it until the clip snaps. Press "B" on your keyboard and "N" on the other side to snap the work area. Navigate to "File" and "Export" and then click on "Render Queue."

![render queue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-5.jpg)

### Step 6: Generating Fill Layer

Import the file when it is done rendering and drag it to the timeline. Trim the work area again using B and N buttons from the keyboard. Ensure that the fill method is "Surface," and the range is "Work Area." Click on "Generate Fill Layer" to start the analyzing process.

![generate fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-6.jpg)

### Step 7: Creating the Transition

The user is expected to create a transition between the two shots. Use the track matte to make solid and fractal noise. In the "Noise and Grain" section, click on "Fractal noise" and then switch the fractal type to "Basic." Now, keyframe the "Brightness" and simultaneously turn its level to black and white to create a transition.

![create transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Achieving a Glitchy Effect

To give the glitchy effect, head to the "Effects and Presets" and hit "Posterize," and reduce its level to a couple of integers. Pull the transition down to the fill layer and set it to "Luma Matte." It will showcase the halo sign that we masked around the image.

![create glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Have a Finer Imprint

To eliminate it, use the "Set Matte" channel and alter its layer to the one we pre-composed. Now, invert the matte. Moving on, navigate to the "Simple Choker" and reduce it to one pixel. For perfection, duplicate it and get a finer imprint.

![customize simple choker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-9.jpg)

### Step 10: Final Process

Duplicate the grey solid and then extend the second clip to our fill. In the last step, change the layer of the second clip to "Luma Matte" and save the video. You are done with the process.

![change to luma matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-10.jpg)

The new remove frame marker will be on the timeline. Drag it to the new scene and then hit "Datamosh." The I-frame removal effect can be shown on the screen. Again, click on (+) to add a new mosh module. Press "Multiply" and then "Average" from the menus that appear. Hit "Average previous 3" afterward.

![i-frame removal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-12.jpg)

### Step 3: Using the Hold Frames Function

Set the in and out points of this mosh marker and again hit "Datamosh." The work area will be rendered. Now, open the mosh module and toggle on the "Hold Frames" feature. Also, toggle on the previous render. Press the "Datamosh" again.

![use hold frames function](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-13.jpg)

### Step 4: Injecting the Frames

Toggle the "Inject Frames" on and press use previous render. Hit "Datamosh" afterward. In this way, the clip will hold the frames and inject them into the transition. Enhance the intensity of the moshing algorithm and eliminate "Remove Frames" and "Inject Frames." Use the previous render and again hit "Datamosh."

![inject frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-14.jpg)

### Step 5: Playing with the Acceleration

Increase the acceleration and bring the intensity back to what it was. Again, use the previous render and click "Datamosh." Now, improve the intensity and set the acceleration back to 0\. Alter the "Blend" as much you need to mix the original and present motion of the transition. Press the "Datamosh."

![play with acceleration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-15.jpg)

### Step 6: Changing the Threshold

Moving on to the threshold feature, this function is a gatekeeper and decides if a pixel will be moshed. Inverse the intensity of the clip, change the blend to be 0, and set the threshold to be a small integer to find out the impact first. It can be enhanced later on. Uncheck the previous render if you are using the new clip for threshold. Hit "Datamosh" again. Now, export the video, and you are done with the datamoshing.

### Step 4: Injecting the Frames

Toggle the "Inject Frames" on and press use previous render. Hit "Datamosh" afterward. In this way, the clip will hold the frames and inject them into the transition. Enhance the intensity of the moshing algorithm and eliminate "Remove Frames" and "Inject Frames." Use the previous render and again hit "Datamosh."

![inject frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-14.jpg)

### Step 5: Playing with the Acceleration

Increase the acceleration and bring the intensity back to what it was. Again, use the previous render and click "Datamosh." Now, improve the intensity and set the acceleration back to 0\. Alter the "Blend" as much you need to mix the original and present motion of the transition. Press the "Datamosh."

![play with acceleration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-15.jpg)

### Step 6: Changing the Threshold

Moving on to the threshold feature, this function is a gatekeeper and decides if a pixel will be moshed. Inverse the intensity of the clip, change the blend to be 0, and set the threshold to be a small integer to find out the impact first. It can be enhanced later on. Uncheck the previous render if you are using the new clip for threshold. Hit "Datamosh" again. Now, export the video, and you are done with the datamoshing.

03 [Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)](#part3)

04 [How to Do Datamoshing Effect with Datamosh Plugin in After Effects](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Datamoshing Effect?

Before going into the depths of workability and operation of the datamoshing effect in After Effects, let us understand the effect in detail. The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.

In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.

Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.

## Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?

The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.

Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.

The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.

The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.

The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.

## Part 3: Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)

Understanding the datamosh After Effects is one thing, and incorporating it in your footage is another. The section shall walk you through the step-by-step guide to create the After Effects' datamoshing effect without a plugin. So, let's go, shall we?

### Step 1: Preliminary Process

The first step is easy. Open After Effects from your system. Import the targeted video that needs the datamosh effect. After that, head to the "Content-Aware Fill" to begin the process.

![tap on content aware fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Creating the Reference Frame

Use the playhead where you wish to create the effect, and then click on "Create Reference Frame." The picture frame opens in Photoshop, and the user is expected to save it. Now, go back to the After Effects.

![create reference frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Smearing Process

Now, hide the top layer so that the smearing can occur. Turn the Masks to "None" so that you can perform the masking. Split the second layer to duplicate the layer as we make changes to it. Set the "Masks" to "Subtract and then add a refine soft matte.

![ smearing process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-3.jpg)

### Step 4: Pre-composing the Clip

It is important to pre-compose the clip, so right-click on the timeline and hit "Pre-compose" to the menu list that appears. Tick mark "Move all attributes into the new composition" and rename the clip afterward. Hit "OK."

![pre-compose clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Rendering Queue

Double-click on the timeline, hold shift and drag it until the clip snaps. Press "B" on your keyboard and "N" on the other side to snap the work area. Navigate to "File" and "Export" and then click on "Render Queue."

![render queue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-5.jpg)

### Step 6: Generating Fill Layer

Import the file when it is done rendering and drag it to the timeline. Trim the work area again using B and N buttons from the keyboard. Ensure that the fill method is "Surface," and the range is "Work Area." Click on "Generate Fill Layer" to start the analyzing process.

![generate fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-6.jpg)

### Step 7: Creating the Transition

The user is expected to create a transition between the two shots. Use the track matte to make solid and fractal noise. In the "Noise and Grain" section, click on "Fractal noise" and then switch the fractal type to "Basic." Now, keyframe the "Brightness" and simultaneously turn its level to black and white to create a transition.

![create transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Achieving a Glitchy Effect

To give the glitchy effect, head to the "Effects and Presets" and hit "Posterize," and reduce its level to a couple of integers. Pull the transition down to the fill layer and set it to "Luma Matte." It will showcase the halo sign that we masked around the image.

![create glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Have a Finer Imprint

To eliminate it, use the "Set Matte" channel and alter its layer to the one we pre-composed. Now, invert the matte. Moving on, navigate to the "Simple Choker" and reduce it to one pixel. For perfection, duplicate it and get a finer imprint.

![customize simple choker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-9.jpg)

### Step 10: Final Process

Duplicate the grey solid and then extend the second clip to our fill. In the last step, change the layer of the second clip to "Luma Matte" and save the video. You are done with the process.

![change to luma matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-10.jpg)

### Step 1: Rendering the Work Area

The exposures can range from the brightest highlights to the darkest shadows. So, in short, HDRI expands an image's dynamic range to brighten or darken it and make it look more natural.

Having said that, HDRI is a raster image created using color pixels. HDRI photos are generally significant in size, so they won't quickly lose quality like other raster photos such as PNG and JPG. Many formats can store HDRI images, although the most common are OpenEXR (.exr) and Radiance RGBE (.hdr).

 Pros

* You can easily create one using HDRI for Blender, Photoshop, EasyHDRI, etc.
* HDRI photos are compatible with many image editing programs.
* Produces crisp images with excellent detail and lighting control.

 Cons

* 32-bit HDRI files have significant sizes.
* HDRI can quickly be poorly done without prior experience.

## Part 2: What's the difference between HDR and HDRI

According to Wikipedia, HDR and HDRI are the same things. But is it true? For starters, HDRI is basically a photo with High Dynamic Range qualities. So, yes, HDR and HDRI can mean the same thing in digital image editing.

However, some photo editors argue that there is a difference between these two regarding basic workflow. First, HDR technology increases brightness to show more image details. On the other hand, HDRI performs unique optimization of content and lighting to deliver crisp images. In other words, HDRI brightens the dark shadows without necessarily overexposing the bright image areas.

Some photographers can also consider HDR as images with pixel values higher than 1 or 255\. That means that the pixels can be much higher than pure white. But technically speaking, HDR and HDRI can be used interchangeably.

## Part 3: When to use HDRI

Now that you have all the information about HDRI, let's learn about some industries where HDRI is applicable.

### 1\. HDRI for 3D visualization and 3D animation

**HDRI 3D** is commonplace these days. 3D animation creators can use programs like **HDRI Blender** to add HDR environments and make the content look detailed and more realistic in high lighting reflections. To put it simply, HDRI makes 3D scenes look lighter, less cartoonish, and more professional. This technology can also be used in interior visualizations in animations.

### 2\. HDRI for architect rendering

Creating HDRI environments is a common practice in 3D architectural designs. For example, designers can create panoramic house designs with varying light tones and interior moods. HDRI helps them give a natural 3D lighting effect on scenes and objects.

### 3\. HDRI monitors and TVs

You've probably heard of **HDRI 4K** when shopping for a smart TV or computer monitor. These TVs offer a lot more than just a wide color gamut, high brightness, and advanced contrast ratio. In addition, HDR TVs and monitors can recognize HDR signals, allowing viewers to watch the content with all studio quality. In short, viewers can see more color details in shadowy and lighter scenes, making them perfect for avid gamers.

## Part 4: How do you open an HDRI?

Because HDRIs use low dynamic range rendering, a standard display panel won't open HDR images. So, to open an HDRI file on a non-HDR display, you'll need to convert it to a different low dynamic range format using tone mapping technology. For example, you convert HDRI to JPEG or PNG and enjoy regular bitmaps while maintaining the HDRI properties. You can also open and edit HDRI using desktop programs like EasyHDR, Photoshop, and Blender.

## Part 5: How to set up an HDR environment background?

Before wrapping up this blog post, let's discuss how to use [HDRI for Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to apply HDR effects to an image's background. Blender is a 100% free program for creating jaw-dropping 3D rendering and animations on Mac and Windows computers. With Blender, you'll get an advanced modeling toolset like retopology, curves, sculpting, and more. But in this post, we'll learn how to create an HDR environment or add lighting to your image project. Let's get started!

Step1Install and run Blender and then tap the World Properties tab. Then, click the Color icon and add Environment Texture.

## How to Record Video Streams With FFmpeg on Windows and Mac?

FFmpeg is an open-source video processing tool with many powerful features. Many of these features are exposed through FFmpeg’s command line interface but can also be accessed from the program’s Python bindings and its Qt GUI frontend, called QFFMpeg.

This article will explain using FFmpeg command line tools to record video streams on Windows and Mac computers with step-by-step examples and screenshots.

## Part 1\. What is FFmpeg?

FFmpeg stands for "FF Multi-Platform Executable" and was originally developed by Fabrice Bellard in the year 2000 as an extension of the MPlayer project. The sole purpose of the software command-line design is to provide a complete solution for users to record live streams (audio and/or video) from any type of device that supports either the RTSP or HTTP streaming protocols.

FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert, mix, and edit audio and video files. The software has over 250 input formats, which allows users to **record video streams** in any media format. The FFmpeg commands stream the video back after recording, convert it into MP4 or MKV file, and process incoming data on the fly, such as rtmpdump.

## Part 2\. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Windows?

The free FFmpeg command line tool is a great way to record a live internet stream and listen back to it later. If you have a Windows PC and want to record a video stream or screen using FFmpeg, our following step-by-step method will help you go through this process without facing many difficulties.

Step1 First, launch a browser of your choice on your Windows PC and head to the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) website. Hover over the Windows icon in the middle pane and select either the **gyan.dev** or **BTbn** build.

![downloading ffmpeg on windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-windows.png)

On the next screen, select the latest **Windows 64-bit** file from the list. Why? You need to use a computer compatible with the Windows 64-bit version. Next, download the ZIP file on your PC and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.

Step2 Locate the **ffmpeg.exe** file on the extracted file and copy it to a new folder on your computer hard drive (e.g., C:\\VideoRecorder).

![extracting ffmpeg files on windows pc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/extracting-ffmpeg-files-on-windows-pc.png)

Step3 In the next step, click the **Start** icon on your Windows dashboard and type **cmd** in the search box. Right-click on Command Prompt, select **“Run as Administrator,”** and launch the program.

![launching command prompt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/launching-command-prompt.png)

Now, write the command to select the FFmpeg directory. For example, cd **C:\\VideoRecorder**, and hit the **“Enter”** key.

Step4 To start recording the video stream, simply call FFmpeg and use the following command line. In this case, we are taking the example of capturing a YouTube video of “Running up that hill” from the top-rated TV show Stranger Things.

ffmpeg.exe -y -i <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao> runningup.mp4

Hit the “Enter” key, and the output of this command will be displayed on the Command Prompt interface.

The command options have the following meanings:

**\-y** allows automatic rewriting of existing files.

**\-i** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao> is the stream URL that FFmpeg will record. You can change it with any video stream URL.

**runningup.mp4** is the name of the output file.

### Tips: Automatically Recording Video Streams on Windows PC

If you want your computer to record a specific video stream time automatically, use the Windows Task Scheduler to create a Timer to stop the recording after a particular time is passed.

## Part 3\. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Mac?

You can use the Mac Terminal to record video streams via FFmpeg in the following way.

Step1 First, launch a browser on your Mac computer and head to the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) website. Hover over the **Apple** icon in the middle pane and select the macOS 64-bit static build option.

![downloading ffmpeg on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-mac.png)

Download the ZIP file on your Mac and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.

Step2 **Launch the terminal** on your Mac from the Apple menu, type the **“ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list\_devices true -i”** command to let the system know which device to record from, and hit the **Enter** key.

Step3 Next, designate the path where you want to save your video, e.g., **cd Path/to/my/videostream** and press **Enter**.

Step4 Type in the **“ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "1:1"-c:v libx264 -qp 0-preset ultrafast out.mp4"** command and hit **Enter** to start recording the video stream.

![starting video stream recording on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/starting-video-stream-recording-on-mac.png)

Stop recording the video stream by pressing **“q.”**

![stopping video stream recording on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stopping-video-stream-recording-on-mac.png)

## Part 4\. How to Record Video Stream More Easily?

Sometimes, using FFmpeg to record a video stream on your Windows or Mac computer is too complicated. So, we recommend using [Filmora Screen Recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make things a little easier for you.

A few benefits of using the Filmora Screen Recording software are as follows:

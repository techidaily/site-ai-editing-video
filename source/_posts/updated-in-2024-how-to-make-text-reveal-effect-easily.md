#### Masking in CyberLink PowerDirector

Drag and drop a photo from the media room into track 2 of your timeline, then drag the background image into track 1.

Then, go to the Quick Settings menu (press the Menu button at the bottom of your screen), select Cloud Print from the drop-down menu, and then select your photo. Then open up the design interface by selecting Mask Designer from the drop-down menu.

You may select from a variety of templates in the Mask Designer. If you want to make your own mask shape, the Mask Designer has three alternatives for you to create new mask types.

Create an image mask: You may use any picture or video, and it will be resized to fit the shape.

Create a text mask: Enter the text you'd like to appear in your photo. Then, go to the left side of the panel under Font/Paragraph on the left side for font style, size, and other options. To alter the text mask itself, go to the preview window and resize it on the left panel.

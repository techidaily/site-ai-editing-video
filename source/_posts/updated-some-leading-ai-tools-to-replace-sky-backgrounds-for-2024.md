## 7 Solutions Cut Video For Instagram On Mac

More video content is being created than before. Unfortunately, some social media platforms like Instagram require your video to be short. Therefore, many people wonder how to cut a video to make it easier to share. If you’re wondering how to cut video for Instagram on Mac, you’re in luck. This article shares the best tools to use for this purpose.

**What You Should Know About Instagram Video**

![cut-video-instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-instagram-1.jpg)

Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.

Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.

A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.

In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.

Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.

Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.

A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page.

In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.

Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.

Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.

A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac.

Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.

Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.

Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.

A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac.

* **Budget**

When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay.

Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.

## How to Clone Yourself in Videos with Filmora?

With the help of video editing programs like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can create clones of yourself. Whether you're looking to create a funny skit or a serious video, cloning yourself can add much production value to your project.

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of how to clone yourself in videos using Filmora.

## Part 1: How to Film Clips for Cloning Effects?

To make cloning effects, you will need to take two different shots and use a tripod to place the camera, so the frame doesn't change.

**Shooting the first clip**

For the first shot, stay on one side of the frame and do the first action. For example, you can pretend to yank and take off your jacket. Then, drop the jacket to the other side of the frame.

![shooting the first clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-1.gif)

To make it more realistic, make an interaction by reacting to the "clone" while facing the other direction.

![make an interaction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-2.jpg)

**Shooting the second clip**

Then, shoot for the second clip without changing the frame. You will have to go to the place where you dropped the jacket from the first shot.

![shooting the second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-3.gif)

Act as if you have just appeared there and give a reaction to the other side as well.

## Part 2: How to Do the Clone Effect with Filmora?

After you have shot the necessary film clips, bring the clips into Filmora 11\. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can go to their website and download it here:

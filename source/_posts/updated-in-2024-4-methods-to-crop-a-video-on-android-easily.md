## 4 Methods to Crop a Video on Android Easily

Nowadays, we can use our mobile phones to create almost anything – they have become an indivisible part of our lives. Most of the people check their mobile phones every 2 minutes – did they receive a new message?

What about different kinds of notifications – reactions on social network, or the ones which inform us about breaking news, or, to-do lists? People are well-connected to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and sometimes, we just want to update our accounts with just photos or new videos we took on the go. Sometimes, we have a perfect footage we took with our Android, but we have no idea, or just no time to edit our stunning video clips on the computer.

Yes, changing or adjusting a video shouldn’t be that hard – you shouldn’t be obligated to turn to Adobe Premiere Pro or other “heavy” software in order to have a video to your whole liking. Therefore, we have mobile applications just for editing our videos, in a simple, and fast way (thank you, mobile developers!).

In this article, we will be discussing how to crop a video on Android, but since most android devices don’t have this option, you will need to do it externally, by downloading and using different apps. So, more concretely, we will touch upon how to crop our video clips using following apps: Google Photos, Clideo, and Filmora.

## Using Google Photos

In case you have Android, the Google Photos app will be there – it’s free and in most cases, already installed and ready to serve you. If you can’t find Google Photos, just find it and download it from the Google Play Store.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-1.jpeg)

First off, you just open the application and allow it to access photos and media on your device. Tap the video you would like to crop. Then, click on Edit: it will launch the in-app video editor.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-2.jpeg)

At the bottom, you will see the Crop option and hit on it, which will result in appearing a cropping box around your video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-3.jpeg)

Once you see little icons at the bottom, you need to choose the first one – it’s the Ratio button, through which you can choose the aspect you would like to apply. Your choice is between these several aspect ratios: Free, Original, Square, 5:4, 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-4.jpeg)

Choosing Free ratio option gives you the freedom to adjust the cropping sliders manually, in order to resize the video to any aspect ratio; it is even possible to rotate the clip, pinch, and zoom in/out.

After you are done with adjusting your video, you need to click on the Save Copy button, which will save a new edited version of your footage. And, meanwhile, don’t worry! – this will not be overwritten on the original one, which will still stand intact.

## Using Clideo

Clideo is an interesting one… it doesn’t require you to download anything, because there is a way to crop your video online, through the web browser on Android.

First off, you need to click on [Clideo’s Android crop video tool](https://clideo.com/crop-video) from the browser on the smartphone. You will see a Choose File button and hit on it – this will take you to your gallery and let you find the clip you are about to crop.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-5.jpeg)

You can also upload your file from Cloud Storage. You need to click on the down-arrow on the right-hand side of the button and you’ll find the option to add a clip from your Dropbox or Google Drive account.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-6.jpeg)

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-7.jpeg)

After your file is uploaded, Clideo will take you to the editing page, where you can select the area you would like to be in the edited version, and crop the video. Here, you will be able to choose the aspect ratio, exact size of the video and the format.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-8.jpeg)

Once you have finished with the cropping and settings, you need to click on Export which will process your edited video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-9.jpeg)

Once it is done, you proceed on the page which lets you do 3 things: Remove watermark (for it, though, you will have to sign in), Edit again, or/and Download!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-10.jpeg)

## Using Filmora

Filmora is an android version of software Filmora and it also gives you the opportunity to crop videos and photos with no problem. First, of course, you have to download the application from Google Play Store, and open it;

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-11.jpeg)

then, after opening it, you’ll click on New Project. You can choose any photo/video from your albums or stock, you might even select multiple clips.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-12.jpeg)

Once you have chosen your file, you click on Next button and you proceed to the editor itself.

There, you will see different options at the bottom of your phone, such as Trim, Music, Text, Sticker, Effect, etc.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-13.jpeg)

 It doesn’t show you the option Crop right away, but Crop is “hidden” behind the Trim button!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-14.jpeg)

So, you choose Trim, then find Crop and hit that, and then you are free to choose any aspect ratio: 1:1; 4:5; 16:9; 9:16; and 5:4\. You can crop the video manually, too, and you are able to adjust where your new “screen” might be wanted most.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-15.jpeg)

After you have finished with cropping and are satisfied, you can click on Export, which will take a few seconds.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-16.jpeg)

After it is done, you can find your newly-cropped video in your Camera Roll.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-11.jpeg)

then, after opening it, you’ll click on New Project. You can choose any photo/video from your albums or stock, you might even select multiple clips.

Once you have chosen your file, you click on Next button and you proceed to the editor itself.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-13.jpeg)

 It doesn’t show you the option Crop right away, but Crop is “hidden” behind the Trim button!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-14.jpeg)

So, you choose Trim, then find Crop and hit that, and then you are free to choose any aspect ratio: 1:1; 4:5; 16:9; 9:16; and 5:4\. You can crop the video manually, too, and you are able to adjust where your new “screen” might be wanted most.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

## How to Choose from Frame Blending/ Frame Sampling/ Optical Flow

The different types of frame blending are:

* **Frame Sampling:** best for smooth movements, no image distortion.
* **Optical Flow:** smoother results but can cause image distortion.
* **Frame Blending:** a mix of the two, some image distortion but smoother results.

So, choosing which type of frame blending to use depends on the footage and the desired results. If you want smooth results with no image distortion, frame sampling is the best option. However, if you don't mind some image distortion in exchange for smoother results, optical flow or frame blending would be better choices.

## How to Remove Audio From Videos with FFmpeg?

Unbelievably, the globe has been making headway in its endeavors. Considering how far the world has come in producing amazing things in recent times, it is impossible to fathom the progress made in the digital industry. There are now millions of video editing programs like **FFmpeg that remove audio**, each allowing you to accomplish anything. In addition to video editing, it is now possible to modify the music playing in the backdrop of a video. Doesn't it seem impossible to you? However, it has an actual appearance and is simple to pull audio from a video. You will, however, need to choose a tool with great care and consideration.

In the following parts, we will discuss how to **remove audio from video with FFmpeg** successfully. In addition, we have also looked at other software that has the potential to be an alternative to FFmpeg that is far more effective.

![remove audio from video ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Use FFmpeg to Remove Audio from Videos?

FFMPEG is a highly flexible video editing program from the command line. You may use it for various purposes, including converting between different file formats. But in addition to that, you may use it to **remove audio from your videos** or clips. Here are two different ways to delete audio using FFMPEG, depending on what you want to do. But most crucially, speed and quality are not sacrificed with any of these choices. It's about coding. When using other people's code, also label the author. Using FFmpeg, you can separate the audio. The audio in video files may be removed, added, extracted, and added again with the help of this powerful utility.

You will only need to [**install FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) on your computer after you have purchased it. Removing video is straightforward, so you won't have to put in much effort to achieve this goal. Let's look at the many methods available.

**Use the Command Line**

Step1 The command to extract audio from your video file is visible for your review.

![ffmpeg use the command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-2.jpg)

Step2 It would be helpful if you updated the extension and the name of the file that was entered, but other than that, you won't need to do anything else.

![ffmpeg audio command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-3.jpg)

The preceding command is successful if the input file certifies. This is why you need to find the codec for the audio stream. If you obey this order, you will accomplish what you set out to do. A user might sometimes use an audio format returned by the previous command. However, this will only occasionally be successful.

The storage format that FFmpeg employs is determined by looking at the output file's extension. It would help if you knew that a storage format, a container, and an audio format are distinct. You will encounter a scenario where the audio format does not have a container named after it. Two problematic formats are among the most common formats; they are PCM and Vorbis. OGG is compatible with Vorbis, whereas WAV is compatible with PCM.

Let's investigate another approach to extract audio from a video using FFmpeg if the prior one was too difficult for you to grasp.

**Use the Terminal**

Step1 Verify that the format remains the same.

You will need to locate the video in its original format to be able to extract the audio from it. If you are unfamiliar with the primary format, you will be unable to determine the appropriate file extension. Because of this, you are going to need to make use of the ffprobe command.

![ffmpeg check the original format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-4.jpg)

Now, change "myvideo.mp4" to the name of the video file you want to use. This will verify that you are familiar with the video's original file format.

After learning about the original audio's format, you can reencode a video clip to remove the audio from it.

![ffmpeg reencoding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-5.jpg)

Step2 Modify the format, please.

You might try replacing myvideo.mp4 with the directory and filename to see if it helps. Additionally, it would be helpful if you updated the name of the audio.ogg file with the name you want to use.

Therefore, if you follow the two approaches discussed above, you can extract audio from your video files with little to no work. To completely comprehend the stages, you must examine them in great detail.

## Part 2: The Most Straightforward Way to Mute Audio in Videos

If you seek an alternative method to **FFmpeg removing audio**, you can meet with an overwhelming number of possibilities, each claiming that it is superior to the others. However, in this instance, additional investigation is not required at all. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will turn out to be one of the better options.

To help you save time and make the editing process more comfortable, the add-on searches for the whole movie in search of any periods of silence automatically eliminates them all.

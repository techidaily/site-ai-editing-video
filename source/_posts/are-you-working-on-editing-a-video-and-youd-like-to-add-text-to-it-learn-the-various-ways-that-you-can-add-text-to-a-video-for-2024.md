In this article, we will share with you the different options you have when you want to add text elements to a video project.

## Add Text to a Video Online

One of the easiest ways that you can add text to any video is to use a free online solution. There are many online tools to choose from but VEED is a free solution that is easy to use and offers a wide range of features to choose from.

## Add Text to Video on Computer

## Elevate Your Designs with Feather Shapes in After Effects

Feathering shapes in After Effects can greatly enhance your designs' overall look and feel. This technique involves creating a soft, blurred edge around the shapes, which adds a sense of depth and dimension. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced After Effects user, understanding how to feather shapes is a valuable skill to have in your arsenal.

This guide will cover everything you need about feathering shapes in After Effects. From the basics to advanced techniques, you'll learn how to add a professional touch to your designs and take your skills to the next level.

Whether you're creating a logo, animation, or visual effect, the ability to feather shapes will help you achieve the desired look and feel for your project. So, let's dive in and explore the world of feathering in After Effects!

## What Is Mask Edge Feather in After Effects?

Mask Edge Feather in After Effects is a feature that enables you to create a soft or blurred transition between the masked and unmasked areas of your composition. The mask feather setting can be found in the properties and is measured in pixels. Increasing the feather value increases the softness or blurriness of the mask's edges, creating a smoother transition between the masked and unmasked parts of the image.

One of the key benefits of feathering masks is that it allows you to blend the masked object with its background, making the effect look more natural and convincing. The mask feather tool can also create custom feather shapes anywhere along the edge of the mask. To access the mask feather tool, switch to the pen tool by pressing the "**G**" key and selecting the feather pen.

The mask edge feather feature in After Effects is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you achieve a wide range of creative effects. Whether you're creating an animation or visual effect, or want to add a professional touch to your designs, understanding how to use the mask feather tool is an essential skill in your After Effects toolkit.

### How To Feather a Shape in After Effects?

Feathering a shape in After Effects is a simple process that can greatly enhance the look and feel of your designs. By following these steps, you'll be able to easily feather shapes in After Effects and add a professional touch to your designs.

Keep in mind that the feather value can be adjusted to your preference and the needs of your project, so feel free to experiment and see what works best for you.

There are two options to feather the edge in After Effects:

**A. Adding a Mask to Shape Layer**

Step1 Add a mask to create a feathered edge.

### How To Use Variable Mask Feather in After Effects?

Variable mask feather in After Effects allows you to create masks with variable feathering. It means you can have different feather values for different parts of the same mask. This feature gives you greater control and flexibility over your masks, allowing you to easily create complex effects and transitions.

With variable mask feathers, you can create complex effects, such as a shape that feathers more in one direction than the other. Or you can create a mask with a soft transition in one area and a hard transition in another.

By experimenting with different feather values and mask shapes, you can achieve a wide range of creative effects in After Effects. To use variable mask feather in After Effects, you'll need to follow these steps:

Step1 Use the pen tool to create corner points.

![after effects pen tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-pen-tool.JPG)

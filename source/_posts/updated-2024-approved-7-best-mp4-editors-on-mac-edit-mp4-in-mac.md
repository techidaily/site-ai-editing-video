## Conclusion

**●** Worry no more when you have a small budget and a tight deadline for your project. Depending on your project's type, nature, and requirements, create bewildering footage using the above 15 LUTs. After applying your favorite LUT, carry out small basic adjustments such as the white balance, brightness, and contrast to your footage when necessary. By doing so, you are going to leave your clients and viewers ground rooted.

**●** A few of these free LUTs have a catch: watching the YouTube video and getting a password for unlocking their free LUT pack. The password is often displayed on the top-right corners of the YouTube videos.

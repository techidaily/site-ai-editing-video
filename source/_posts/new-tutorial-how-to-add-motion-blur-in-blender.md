Motion blur effect, as a terminology, holds great significance in multiple industrial uses. From filmmaking to basic photography, the motion blur effect is consumed as a reality-setting standard, which defines its significance. Many platforms are providing this effect to enhance the creativity of their users. Blender is also known among these software providing such services while designing animations.

We will target a comprehensive guide on **adding motion blur in Blender** using the right way. Therefore, if you seek the appropriate way of adding motion blur in Blender, the following description is for you.

## Part 1: What is Blender?

As we start our discussion, we will review [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a free and open-source software. Following this, we will continue realizing the benefits of adding motion blur through Blender:

### Introduction to Blender

For those unaware of Blender, it is an open-source, free creativity software. You can find it as the perfect designing platform for your 3D content. This software has made itself accessible to the market with ease. This has made it quite famous among professionals, and is recommended for its high-quality, feature-rich design. From modeling to sculpting, Blender provides some great options to work with.

### Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect

There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:

**· Perfect For Idolizing Speed**

The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.

**· Resolves Flickering**

Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.

**· Attenuates Real-Effect**

One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.

## Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?

As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on **how to add motion blur in Blender**:

Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the "Render Properties." Look to enable "Motion Blur" from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.

![enable the motion blur option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg)

Step2 Start by setting its "Position" in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use "Center on Frame." If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the "Shutter" value or vice versa.

![adjust the shutter value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg)

Step3 Following this, define the "Background Separation" according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the "Max Blur" pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.

![set background separation and max blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg)

Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.

Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.

The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.

Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.

Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we'll show you in this article.

## How to Edit Recorded Video

The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don't need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.

Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you're on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don't have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we've put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you'll need to know to make stunning films, even if you've never done it before. We'll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.

## **Part 1\. Edit Recorded Video in OBS**

OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It's open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.

**Step 1\. Download and Install OBS**

Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.

**Step 2\. Setup Screen Recording**

The window is divided into separate parts called "docks" when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you'll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.

![obs setup screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg)

You'll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).

**Step 3\. Customize the Recording Source**

You'll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select "Display Capture" by clicking the "+" icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click "OK". At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.

![obs customize the recording source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg)

**Step 4\. Start/Stop Recording**

You'll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you're ready to begin recording. When you're finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.

![obs start stop recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-start-stop-recording.jpg)

## **Part 4\. Edit Recorded Video in Teams**

Teams gives the opportunity to record your online meetings. This may be especially beneficial for sharing meeting recordings with individuals unable to attend live, to preserve instructional material for future use, or to enable participants to revisit prior meeting topics. At the top of the meeting window, a message will appear stating that the recording has begun, which alerts participants that their interactions in the meeting may be recorded by the recording. You will also notice a recording sign and the duration of the recording in the top-left corner of the meeting window.

### Steps to Record Videos with Teams

**Step 1** Open Microsoft Teams on Windows and Mac.

Please note that depending on the length of the recording it might take some time for the recording to complete and display in the meeting chat. To find the recording, pick the Chat panel, open the correct meeting from the chat list and the recording will display in the chat window once processed.

You may have an online video conference, see everyone’s face, communicate, and take care of business.

To have formal documentation for your meeting or share it with people who couldn’t attend, try recording your Google Meet.

## **Part 6: Related FAQs**

**1\. How do I edit video recordings?**

Most individuals have the tools they need to film and edit small videos. With a smartphone or tablet and access to a computer, you can get the job done without even checking out equipment, much less employing a key grip.

Some editing software has this option built-in, but if you use Windows 10 to edit, it's hard to find out how to brighten a video in Windows 10 without the help of additional software.

## Does Windows 10 have built-in video editing software?

The answer is yes. Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn't work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.

You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You'll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.

Some people say that windows video editor has a very simple interface and it only has very basic features. In this case, having something is more important than not having anything at all. Also, you should keep in mind that not everyone needs a fully-fledged [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Some people have to do just basic tasks like trimming a video and increasing the brightness of a video. It is not feasible for them to purchase expensive video editing software for that purpose. So the Windows 10 video editor is the best in this case.

## How To Brighten A Video In Windows 10 Easily

This article will discuss two different methods using which you can easily brighten your videos in Windows 10\. So, without wasting any more time, let's get started.

### 1\. Using Filmora to brighten a video in Windows 10

You may think that all video editing software is created equal, but that's where you're wrong. The best video editor for your needs is drastically different depending on what you want to do with the end product. Some people want a quick way to make a trailer or showcase their products, and others want to put together an amateur movie.

Filmora is one of the best video editing software for Windows that can improve or fix your dark videos. Filmora is an all-in-one video editor for Windows and Mac. With Filmora, you can easily edit videos and make simple videos with transitions and effects, and you can give any video a professional touch. It's a great piece of software that works incredibly smoothly. Filmora is an attractive and easy-to-use application that will give your video the final polish it needs. If you've ever had a video that looked too dark to use, there are ways to fix it aside from taking an entirely new video.

If you’ve ever had a video that looked too dark to use, then you can easily brighten it up using Filmora. Just follow the steps given below:

### Step 1

First of all, make sure that you have installed the latest version of Filmora on your computer. If you haven't already installed it, then you can download it easily from the official website of Wondershare.

### Step 2

Upon starting Wondershare Filmora, click the "Import" button. The import media item window will open and show you all the files on your computer.

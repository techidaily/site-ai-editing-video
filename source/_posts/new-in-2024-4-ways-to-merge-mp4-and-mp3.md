## Part I. 4 Tips To Make A Quiz Video

Here are three tips to help you make a quiz video that will engage your audience and get them to participate.

**1\. The Order Of Quiz Questions**

The first tip is to make sure you order your quiz questions correctly. You don't want to start with the easy ones and then gradually get harder - this will make your quiz too easy and boring.

Instead, start with the most challenging questions and then work your way down to keep your audience engaged and challenged throughout the video.

**2\. Valid bases for questions**

Make sure you have a valid basis for your questions. This means researching and ensuring that they are based on factual information.

**3\. Clear questions and answers**

Keep your questions short, to the point, clear, and grammatically correct. Also, avoid jargon, slang, or “trick” questions in your quiz designed to trip up your viewers. This will help ensure that your audience understands them and can answer correctly.

**4\. Check out the final work**

Always ensure that you check your final work before posting it on YouTube. Avoid misspelled characters or confusing sentences, and add an element of fun to make your quiz interesting.

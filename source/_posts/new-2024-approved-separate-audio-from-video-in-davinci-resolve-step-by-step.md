Developed by Apple, QuickTime Player is a software application designed to play, edit, record, and share video and audio files on your Mac. It was created in 1991, and QuickTime X is the latest Mac version available for users of Mac OS X Snow Leopard to macOS Mojave.

QuickTime Player is supported by MovieWorks, PowerPoint, HyperCard, Director, and other standard multimedia authoring apps. One of the exciting features that QuickTime brings to the internet is that it enables video streaming over networks.

In 2016, Apple ended support for the QuickTime Windows version. In 12018, they ceased support for QuickTime 7 version on macOS.

When it comes to OS X Lion, QTKit (the underlying QuickTime media) was deplored in favor of AVFoundation, which was the newer graphics framework and discontinued as of macOS Catalina.

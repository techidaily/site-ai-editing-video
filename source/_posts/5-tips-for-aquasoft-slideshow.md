The software enters into repeated installation and uninstallation cycles out of the blue, causing much inconvenience at the user’s disposal, making it a necessity to permanently get rid of the program.

**●** **Reduced User Credibility**

The software reviews often report of unsatisfied users with an unreliable working experience. If that was not enough, some of the most trusted product review websites and long term users of the program have rendered the utility to be malicious.

**●** **Absence in Control Panel**

While all your system and application software can be found on the Control Panel and Windows listings, the aforesaid slideshow creator program is an exception. This leads to the unavailability of troubleshooting methods and settings adjustments, in case the program encounters a problem while running.

**●** **Incomplete Removal**

One of the biggest glitches with the software is that you possibly can never uninstall it completely, because some of the latter’s associated processes and software file traces tend to remain forever on your system, causing interference with the working of other programs.

**●** **Never-ending Uninstallation Process**

While you may opt to take the program out of your system to get rid of the inconvenience, that too is not an easy process to say the least. The uninstallation process once initiated does not seem to reach its end to what you can call ages!

### 02Uninstallation Inconsistencies of Aquasoft Slideshow Premium Software

Inconsistencies lie within the software itself, with its inbuilt uninstaller program refusing to work in cohesion with the assigned task. Sometimes it may refrain from opening up, while in other cases, the program comes to an unannounced run halt amid the uninstallation process.

**●** **Issues of File Processing**

The preset uninstallation package often fails to run or process a particular file which is necessary for uninstalling the program. The running process may often not initiate or stop midway, hence causing users enough discomfort to move towards getting rid of the program.

**●** **Processing Errors**

Often during the uninstallation process, you may encounter a series of processing errors leading to unsuccessful installation of most of the important files, which causes the leash over of partially deleted program files, barging your system’s memory with unusable data and irrelevant information.

**●** **Startup Prevention**

It may be a common instance to notice that the program refrains from being completely uninstalled due to some different program installed in your device. The allied program may interfere with the uninterrupted running of the Aquasoft uninstallation program.

Step 2: Click the 'Create a video' button on the left sidebar. There are five different forms from which to pick. First, choose the video aspect ratio that works best for your project. For example, if you wish to upload to YouTube, we recommend shooting in widescreen 16:9.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-13.jpg)

Step 3: Click 'Add media' and drag and drop your films, audio, and photographs into the media box if you already have filmed footage you'd like to utilize in your project. You may also add media by clicking 'Browse my files.' If you wish to use free stock footage, go to 'Stock' and upload your films to the project by clicking the '+' button. All your films will be saved in your library.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-14.jpg)

Step 4: You can now find your videos in your media library. Drag and drop the picture-in-picture videos you want to alter to the editing timeline. As shown in the sample below, arrange the two videos one over the other. Make sure both clips are precisely underneath one another.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-15.jpg)

Step 5: Now that your movies are aligned, select the one you want to shrink. The video you're reducing must be at the top of the screen. To move it from the bottom to the top, drag and drop it. A small box will appear on the timeline in the bottom left corner of the clip. The clip will shrink when you click the box once. When you click the box once again, modifying choices will appear. You can move the smaller video around and increase or decrease its size.

Step 6: Export your project once you've completed editing your video. Save to your preferred place or folder. You can share the video straight on social media or embed it in a document.

### 5\. Movavi

Compatibility: Windows/Mac

Movavi Video Editor is a video editing tool for Windows that is powerful and simple to use. Apply stunning video effects and filters, add music and titles, and more! Yet, despite its enormous features, Movavi's video editing program is quite simple to use: add a sprinkle of fantasy and some spare time, and you'll have a Hollywood-style video with far less effort.

#### Steps

**Step 1: Download the software.**

 Download the installation file and run it. Follow the on-screen directions. Following the setup, the PiP editor will launch.

**Step 2: Import files**

Select two files: the one you want to use as a background and the one you want to display over it by clicking Add Files.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-18.jpg)

**Step 3: Create a video track**

Make an extra video track before you begin video editing. To do so, go to the Plus menu and select Add Video Track. Then, drag one of the videos to the secondary track and the other to the primary track.

From the menu, select the Picture in Picture option. To change the size of the video, drag the boundaries. Then, drag it to the desired location on the background video by clicking and holding.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-19.jpg)

**Step 4: Export and Save**

Save your PiP video once you've finished editing it. First, select the video format, quality, and folder where the file will be saved by clicking Export and adjusting the parameters in the display popup. Then press the Start button. The picture-in-picture video editor will open the folder holding the file after the Export is complete.

2. Open the filters by tapping.
3. Select your look by tapping a filter at the bottom of the screen (swipe left or right to preview them).

### 4\. Does Facetime have virtual backgrounds?

### 5\. Can you get fake facetime calls?

There is less probability of getting fake facetime calls, but you might spam FaceTime calls from random numbers.

FaceTime isn't any different. A caller could try their luck by FaceTime a random phone number or email address, and if they belong to an iPhone user or an Apple ID, the FaceTime call will be accepted.

### 7\. Can you Facetime from an unknown number?

Switching to your email address for FaceTime audio and video chats is the way to go if you always want to keep your phone number private. You may even go a step further and only receive FaceTime calls via email, with your phone number serving as your FaceTime caller ID.

Launch FaceTime. In the search field, type the names, phone numbers, or email addresses of the persons you wish to contact. Then, click the video or audio icon, depending on the type of call you wish to make. To begin the call, press the video or audio button in the screen's bottom-left corner.

## 1\. What is Vlog?

A Vlog is a piece of video that document a person’s life or expertise, with an average length of around five minutes. The word vlog is "video" and "blog". Vlog are created to connect with an audience through shared ideas and experiences in the form of video.

## 2\. Tips on How to Become a YouTube Vlogger

* Create a Channel
* Content
* Equipment
* Skills
* Collaborate

## 3\. Create a YouTube Channel

Your channel name is the official name for your channel on YouTube. Your channel name is a big part of how people will define and understand what your channel is about. So, it’s important that your name accurately represents your brand. It's important that your name stands out from another channel on YouTube or should be unique.

![Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** So before deciding on a name, pop your potential name into YouTube and see what comes up, if you can’t find any similar sounding channels, you’re good to go.

For example, my channel name is Mayang Dyosa, Mayang is what my family and friend called me and Dyosa means Goddess. I find it unique and cute because that’s my dream to be a Goddess.

### ❶ Content

One of the challenging parts being a YouTuber is finding a right content for your channel.

You can use YouTube’s trending page this is the easiest way to find trending topic for you to have an idea of what topic or content you like. You can always use or share experiences to be your topic content whether it is beauty, make-up tutorial, DIY’s, Skin care ideas, etc. As long as you can share honestly and correctly.

Do whatever you love, do something that you like, expertise, make a relatable videos or timely videos and searchable videos. Create a content that people need or are often searched for online, content that can provide information to people. I suggest you go with "how to" videos, because people always searched for this kind of content.

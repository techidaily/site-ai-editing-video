## FAQs

### Q1\. How to merge two MP4 videos into 1?

Whether you have two MP4 clips or videos with different extensions, you can easily merge them into one with Filmora. To do that, position both videos on the same track without space. Then, export the project in your desired output format, such as MP4.

### Q2\. What is the best app for combining videos?

For fast video joining, you can choose Filmora or Adobe Premiere Pro. Both apps are available on Windows and Mac operating systems. Moreover, the combining process is also trouble-free.

### Q3\. How to merge two videos without losing quality?

Professionals with years of video editing experience choose Premiere Pro to maintain the quality of the merged videos. But remember, any mistakes in the export settings can reduce the calibre. Contrarily, Filmora offers user-friendly and uncomplicated export options so you can save combined videos in the highest quality possible.

## The Bottom Line

Different methods of merging videos depend primarily on the type of program you intend to use. The step-by-step guide is to help beginners move ahead in their careers and choose the best method that they find easy. Each method is easy-to-use and accessible by all users. Also, it doesn't require you to invest money to purchase premium versions of video merging softwares.

However, there are some other softwares that can also be used to merge videos. But they are complex and makes it challenging for a beginner to merge videos easily.

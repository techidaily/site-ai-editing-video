![sample color filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/white.png)

Step 5

For the next step, you need to download a simple [Vignette png image](https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/ihbooTJ%5Feffect-gfx-png-black-vignette-png-transparent-png/). Then, import the Vignette image into Filmora. Go to **My Media** and click on **Import Media.** Import it and drag the image to the Timeline. Then, move that clip to Track 3.

![vignette png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vignette.png)

Step 6

Drop the **Black** snapshot you took earlier to Track 2\. Double-click on it, go to **Animation**, and apply these settings. After this, move the Playhead to the end of the clip and change the **X-axis** value to “**\-800**”.

![snapshot settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black.png)

Step 7

Go to **Effects** and drag the **Square Blur** effect to Track 4 on the Timeline. Increase its duration to match the other clips. Then, click on the effect and change its **Size** bar value to 4\. Click **OK.**

![add effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/effect.png)

Step 8

Place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip. Go to **My Media** and drag the Black snapshot to Track 5\. Double-click on it → go to **Animation** and change the settings to look like this. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds. Here, change the **X-axis** to “**150”** and the **Scale** to **75%.**

![edit snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black-snapshot.png)

Step 9

Now, place the Playhead at the starting point and drag the colored snapshot in Track 6\. Double-click on it and change the **Scale** to **50%**. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds again and change the **Scale** to **75%.** Click **OK.**

Step 10

Go to **Sample Color** and drag “Gradient 4” to Track 7 on the Timeline. Double-click on it → go to the **Video** tab → change the Blending Mode to **Overlay** → decrease the Opacity to **25%.** Click **OK.**

![gradient sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/gradient.png)

Step 11

Drag a Default Title to Track 8 and double-click on it to open its Advanced settings. From here, delete the yellow text clip located under the video. Then, insert a Line shape.

![insert line shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line.png)

Step 12

Increase the Line’s length to be almost as long as the screen. Then adjust its position until half of the Line is visible on the screen. Like this.

![edit shape in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-line.png)

Step 13

Copy this Default Title and paste it into Track 9\. Open its Advanced settings and change the Line color to something different than the previous one. Then, move it to the other side of the screen, slightly above the previous line. Click **OK.**

![add line shapes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lines.png)

Step 14

Now, select the Default Title on Track 9, double-click it, and go to the **Animation** tab. Move the Playhead at the starting point of the Timeline and add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead to the end of the clip. Drag the **X-axis** position to the right until the Line shape moves all the way to the right side of the screen.

Do the same for the Default Title on Track 8\. But this time, drag the **X-axis** position toward the other side. When you’re done, press **OK.**

![animate shapes filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line-move.png)

## How to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

With the vast number of devices available in the market today, storing data and video files has become difficult. Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.

In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you'll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video's resolution, let's look into what a video resolution is!

## Part 1\. What Is a Video Resolution?

A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of **tiny pixels** and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.

Video resolution is rendered in a **vertical** and **horizontal** orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., **480p**, **720p**, **1080p,** etc.

In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a **720p** video is **1280 x 720,** and a **1080p** video is a **1920 x 1080** resolution.

![a video resolution dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-1.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.

![difference between a 4k and 8k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-6.png)

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

Now let's move to understanding the steps involved in changing the resolution of a video!

## Part 4\. Steps to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

To change the resolution of a video, you would need a basic video editor. This video editor needs to support the features that enable you to adjust a video resolution. In this case, Filmora is the best option.

![wondershare filmora selecting files to import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-8.png)

If you need clarification about the resolution of the video that you imported, you can also check them before adding it to the timeline.

* **Right-Click** on the video in the import window.
* In the pop-up column, go to **Properties**.

It opens a window that will tell you the basic info about your video clips. Here you can also preview the resolution.

![wondershare filmora previewing a video's resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-9.png)

Now that we have our clips imported, it is time to add them to the timeline below!

##### Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline

To add Video clips to the timeline, go through the steps as guided:

* Hold Right click to drag and select the **video clips** in the import window.
* Release Right-click when in the **timeline**.

![wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-10.png)

You can **trim**, **add effects**, and **join** multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it's time to select an export format.

##### Step4 Export Your Video

You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.

**Video Format Resolution**

Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include **MP4**, **WMV**, **F4V**, **MOV**, **TS**, **3GP**, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:

* Click on **Export**.
* In the left column, click on the **video** format you need.
* Click **Export** on the bottom right corner of the window.

![wondershare filmora selecting video format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png)

Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.

**Default Resolution Settings**

Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., **TS** has a default **1080p** resolution.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to **1080p**. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a **3GP** format, which is set to **352 x 488** by default.

**Customize the Resolution**

But if you don't find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:

* In the preset tab, go to > **settings**.
* In the video tab, click on the **resolution**.
* In the **drop-down** menu, select the resolution that you desire.

You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:

* In the **drop-down** menu, click on **Custom**.
* Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.

![wondershare filmora setting a custom resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-12.png)

**Exporting a Video to a Specific Device**

Selecting a format for your video can help if you want to change the resolution. But in cases where you want to export a video to a particular mobile device. Such as an **iPhone** or an **iPad**, you can select the device export option.

In the device export option, you can select a custom device. Filmora allows you to choose from a wide variety of machines available when you choose a custom device; the resolution will be set to optimal for that particular device.

**Select a Folder to Export Your Video**

After you are done calibrating the resolution settings, you can move on to select the export location for your video. You can do so by the steps mentioned:

* In the main Export window, navigate to the **Save**
* Click on the **Folder**

## Conclusion

Rapid video technology advancement is leading to the development of higher-resolution devices. The greatest resolution in the modern day is the **8K**; soon, everyone will be using 8K devices. So, it is beneficial to learn how to change a video's resolution.

By following the steps mentioned in this article, you can now change the resolution of your video using Filmora.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.

![difference between a 4k and 8k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-6.png)

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

Now let's move to understanding the steps involved in changing the resolution of a video!

## Part 4\. Steps to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

To change the resolution of a video, you would need a basic video editor. This video editor needs to support the features that enable you to adjust a video resolution. In this case, Filmora is the best option.

##### Step4 Export Your Video

You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.

**Default Resolution Settings**

Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., **TS** has a default **1080p** resolution.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to **1080p**. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a **3GP** format, which is set to **352 x 488** by default.

**Customize the Resolution**

But if you don't find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:

* In the preset tab, go to > **settings**.
* In the video tab, click on the **resolution**.
* In the **drop-down** menu, select the resolution that you desire.

You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:

* In the **drop-down** menu, click on **Custom**.
* Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.

**Exporting a Video to a Specific Device**

Selecting a format for your video can help if you want to change the resolution. But in cases where you want to export a video to a particular mobile device. Such as an **iPhone** or an **iPad**, you can select the device export option.

In the device export option, you can select a custom device. Filmora allows you to choose from a wide variety of machines available when you choose a custom device; the resolution will be set to optimal for that particular device.

## How to Use a Stabilization Tool in Filmora

Does your video shake so much? Shaking movement on your camera is often inevitable, especially if you don't use a camera stabilizer or a camera with no built-in image stabilization. As a result, it can make your video look distracting and difficult to watch.

But you don't need to worry. You can use a stabilization tool in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). A stabilization tool is a feature that can help to correct for camera shake and other types of movement. If you are a handheld shooter, you will find this tool extremely helpful.

## Part 1: When do you need to stabilize your video?

Now, let's talk about when you should stabilize your video. If you're shooting something that is moving, like people or animals, you will definitely want to stabilize your video. This will help ensure that the video is smooth and steady.

Another time you may want to stabilize your video is if you're shooting in a low-light situation. It will help to ensure that your video is not too shaky.

Finally, if you're shooting a video that's going to be displayed on a large screen, you may want to stabilize your video. Stabilizing your video will help ensure the output is crisp and clear.

## Part 2: How to stabilize your video with Filmora

Filmora has a stabilization feature that can help to smooth your video and make it look more professional. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can download it for free.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

So, should you have a wobble movement in your video, follow these steps to make it smoother in no time:

Step1 Launch Filmora 11 and **create a new project**.

Step2 Import your video to Filmora.

![import your video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Step3 After you import your video to Filmora, the Stabilization must have been off. So, **switch the Stabilization toggle on**, then a loading bar will start going up to analyze the clip.

![switch the stabilization toggle on](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-2.jpg)

Step4 Once it finishes analyzing, the smooth level will default to 10\. See the preview whether you like how it turns out.

**Before**

![before finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-3.gif)

**After**

![after finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-4.gif)

Please note that the center point of your image will always be the most stable. The more shaky a clip is, the more it will crop into that image.

If you are unsatisfied with the default setting, increasing the Smoothness Level will result in more cropping to the image. On the contrary, if you put the Smoothness Level down to zero, you are no longer cropping into the image, but the result won't be as smooth.

![adjust smothness level as byou like](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-5.gif)

Should the cropping bother you, such as it crops the subject's hair out of the frame, you can adjust it with **Edge Processing**.

If you change it to **None**, you will see the black bars that simulate how it stabilizes the clip. Try to hit play on the preview screen, and then you can see more clearly how the tool keeps the center of the frame to make it stable and less shaky.

![hit play on the preview screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-6.gif)

As **Reflect** is the default, the **Extend** uses artificial intelligence to extend the pixels, as you are often aware in Photoshop.

![extend the pixels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-7.jpg)

Besides the three, there is also the **Tile** option. Each of them would give a different result. You can try and use the one that works best for you.

## Summary

When you're shooting a video, you must have wanted it to be as smooth and stable as possible. By stabilizing your video, you can help ensure it's smooth and easy to watch.

Filmora offers a Stabilization feature that allows you to easily improve your video's quality. Simply select the video clip you want to stabilize and click the stabilization button. Filmora will do the rest, giving you a smooth and stable video.

01 [What Is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?](#Part 1)

02 [What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?](#Part 2)

03 [10 Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?**

Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.

The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.

**Technology Behind Augmented Reality**

As far as the technology behind the development of **augmented reality video** is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.

The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.

## Part 2 **What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?**

Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.

Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:

**●** **Underlying Concept**

Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.

**●** **Existence Constraints**

Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.

**●** User Control

Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.

## Part 3 **Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing**

Having discussed enough about the fundamental aspects of augmented reality, let us proceed towards understanding the credibility of **augmented video** in the light of modern day information centered applications. While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:

03 [10 Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?**

Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.

The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.

**Technology Behind Augmented Reality**

As far as the technology behind the development of **augmented reality video** is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.

The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.

## Part 2 **What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?**

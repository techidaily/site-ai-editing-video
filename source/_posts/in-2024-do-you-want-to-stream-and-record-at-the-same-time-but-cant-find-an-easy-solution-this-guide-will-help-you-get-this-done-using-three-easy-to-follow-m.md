## Do You Want to Stream and Record at the Same Time but Can't Find an Easy Solution? This Guide Will Help You Get This Done Using Three Easy-to-Follow Methods

The popularity of live streaming has exploded recently. A live stream is simply a video broadcast in real-time over the internet. It's a great way to connect with people directly, whether for a gaming session, a cooking show, or a Q&A.

Many reasons are there for which why you might want to live stream and record at the same time. For instance, keep a record of your gameplay or stream highlights for future editing or use your live stream to generate content for your YouTube channel.

Whatever your reasons, this article will show you how to do live streaming and recording at the same time using three different methods.

## Way 1\. Use OBS To Stream And Record Video At The Same Time

OBS, or Open Broadcaster Software, is a free and open-source tool that allows you to stream and record video at the same time, which can be useful if you want to live-stream your gameplay on Twitch or record a tutorial for YouTube.

### Key Features of OBS

* Compatible with Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows operating systems.
* Requires at least 4 GB of storage space and an Intel i5 2000-series processor or higher DirectX 10 capable graphics card.
* High-performance video capturing and mixing in real-time.
* With Custom Transitions, you can set up an unlimited number of scenes you can switch between seamlessly.
* Intuitive audio mixer.
* Easy-to-use and simple configuration options.

### Steps

Here's an easy and quick guide on how to use OBS Studio to stream and record videos simultaneously:

Step1 Download [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com/) from the official website and install it on your computer or laptop.

Step2 Launch **OBS Studio** and go to the **Settings** menu. Find the **Recording** section under the Output tab.

Step3 Click **"Start Recording"** to manually start the recording or head to the **General Tab** and checkmark the box before **"Automatically Record When Streaming."**

![using obs studio to record and stream video at same time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/using-obs-studio-to-record-and-stream-video-at-same-time.png)

Step4 Finally, click **"Apply"** to save your settings. Now when you start your stream, the recording will also begin simultaneously.

## Way 2\. Use Twitch To Save Your Streams

Twitch is the most popular and best live streaming platform that allows gamers to broadcast their gameplay to a live audience and also gives them the ability to save their past broadcasts, or **"streams."**

This feature can be useful to save your live stream for later viewing or share your stream with someone who missed it.

### Features

Twitch offers a variety of features that make it a unique and powerful game streaming platform. Some of the most notable ones are:

* **Live streaming:** Twitch allows gamers to share their gameplay in real-time with other gamers around the world. This live aspect of the platform makes it unique and engaging.
* **Social interaction:** Twitch offers a variety of features that allow gamers to connect with each other, including chat rooms, forums, and user-generated content.

**You can save your stream on Twitch in two ways:**

* Use the **"Highlights"** feature, which allows you to save specific moments from your live stream.
* Download your stream's entire **VOD** (video on demand) after it has ended.

### Steps

Here are the quick steps to saving a stream on your PC from Twitch. But first, you need to enable Twitch VODs before starting your broadcast in the following way:

Step1 Visit [**Twitch**](https://www.twitch.tv/) and sign in to your account. Now, click the **"Profile"** icons and go to **"Creator Dashboard."**

Step2 Head to **Setting** from the left-sidebar and click the **"Stream"** option. Scroll down and find the VOD Settings. Toggle the buttons next to **"Store Past Broadcasts."**

![saving streams on twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/saving-streams-on-twitch.png)

Step3 To publish your VODs instantly after broadcasting, toggle the button next to **"Always Publish VODs."**

Now, to download the recordings of your broadcasts to your PC, do the following steps in sequence:

Step1 Head to the [**Creator Dashboard,**](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/) find the **"Content"** section in the left sidebar, and click **"Video Producer."**

Step2 Find the stream (VOD or Highlights) you want to download and on the right side, click the three dots.

Step3 Finally, click the **"Download"** option and let Twitch prepare your video. You will then get the stream's recording in MP4 format.

## Way 3\. Use Screen Recorder To Record Your Streams

Using a screen recorder is a great way to record your live stream because it lets you capture the full screen of your PC. Although there are many different screen recorders to choose from, we recommend using Filmora.

[**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a powerful editor with easy-to-use screen recording capabilities, giving you everything you need to **record and stream your video at the same time.** The software is free to use and has an intuitive interface.

## How to Make Eye Zoom Transition Effect with Filmora

What is an eye zoom transition effect? It's a close-up video effect allowing viewers to transit to the next clip from the eye. This effect is commonly used by musicians and travel bloggers to give their videos a more cinematic feel. So, without wasting time, let's learn how to create an eye zoom transition with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

**_Preparation:_**

First, you need to create a close-up eye video. Although you can do that with your digital camera, a standard smartphone should do it just fine. Just ask a friend or family member to use your phone's rear camera to record your eye centered on the screen. Ensure that the eye is as close as possible and you don't lose focus. The camera should be around 10cm away from your face. And lest I forget, the flash should be ON.

![create a close-up eye video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/close-up-eye-video.gif)

## How to Create an Eye-zoom Transition

##### Step 1 Align the video clips on Filmora

After recording a close-up eye video, add it on Wondershare Filmora and duplicate it. Alternatively, you can add the video to the first and second tracks.

![align the video clips on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 Add a freeze frame to the video

Next, we want to add a freeze frame to the section where the eye opens fully. To do that, select the second video track and place the playhead where the eye is fully open. After that, right-click the video track, then choose the **Add Freeze Frame** option.

![add a freeze frame to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-2.jpg)

Now trim the first video track from where the freeze frame starts on the second video. Also, cut the second video track to leave only the freeze frame

##### Step 3 Add a masking effect to the eye

With the two video tracks ready, it's time to apply a masking effect. Tap the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and then find the **Shape Mask** under the utility section. Now drag and drop the effect to the freeze frame.

![add a masking effect to the eye](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-3.jpg)

Double-click on the freeze frame clip to adjust the Shape Mask on the preview screen. Ensure the mask reveals the eye pupil only and check the **Invert Mask** box. Also, set the **Feather** number to 10.

![double-click on the freeze frame clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-4.jpg)

##### Step 4 Add the transition video

Next, add the video you want to edit with an eye-zoom effect next to the first video track. Preview the video, and you'll notice your new video playing inside the eye mask.

With that done, move the playhead to the start of the freeze frame video and double-click the video clip to launch the settings window. Click the **Animation** tab before clicking **Customize** to see the keyframe settings. Tap the **Add** button to add a keyframe. Then, add a few frames using the playhead before clicking Add. But because we're zooming in, increase the scale to 160%. You can also add the rotation and position.

![add the transition video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-5.jpg)

After setting the second keyframe, move the playhead to the right and add the third keyframe. This time, increase the scale number to 400%, as well as the rotation and position. Now preview the video, and you'll notice the rotating eye-zoom effect.

## Summary

## Ultimate Guide on How to Plan and Storyboard a Music Video

Do you want to bring your music to life on the big screen? Do you want to create something visually striking? Making a music video seems like a big task. Sometimes, the artist you're working with might not have a clear idea for their music video. It's your job to help guide the creative process.

But don't worry! This guide is going to make it easy for you to plan and storyboard your music video step by step with the help of [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). So let's get started and make an amazing music video together!

## Plan and develop initial ideas

The first and essential step in creating a music video is planning. This is where you will lay the foundation of your music video. You need to figure out what your video is about and what you want to convey to the audience. It involves a concept or theme for the video, research, and reference material. You can also explore different ideas to make your video unique and engaging.

![graphical text of initial ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-initial-ideas.jpg)

##### Step1Research and gather information

You can begin by researching and gathering information from other music videos. This will help you to know what has been done before and what is currently popular. You can also figure out how you can do it differently.

##### Step2Brainstorm and concept development

Once you understand the current trends and styles in the music video. It's time to start brainstorming ideas. You can do it alone or with the help of your team. But remember that you have to think out of the box to make it creative.

##### Step3Consider the lyrics and message

In the planning stage, it is also important to consider the lyrics and message of the song. It would be best if you plan according to the feel and vibe of the song. It will help you to create a concept tied to the song and will help enhance its meaning.

##### Step4Experiment and find the right direction

Once you have a general concept, it's time to develop it further. You can do it by creating rough sketches or storyboards. You can also film test footage to see how the concept will look on screen.

##### Step5Effort and attention to detail

Remember, this step is the foundation of your music video. So, take your time and don't rush through it. By putting in effort and attention to detail, you'll be able to create a visually stunning and closely tied to the song's music video.

## Choose a style for your music video

While creating ideas for the music video, it's also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:

![types of music video style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/types-of-music-video-style.jpg)

### 1.Performance-style music video

If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.

### 2.Narrative-style music video

A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.

You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.

Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.

![treatment of the plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/treatment-of-the-plan.jpg)

If the artist approves the direction of the video, it's time to move on to storyboarding!

## Storyboard your music video

Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding! It allows you to break down your music video visually and highlight key visual moments. It can save time and money and convey a clear idea to the team. You can do this on paper, a computer, or a tablet, whatever works best for you.

## How to Trim Videos in PowerPoint

Many people use Microsoft PowerPoint to prepare basic animated explainers and presentations, but you can learn how to trip or crop videos in this program with the tools that it provides. With that in mind, here is how to trim, reset, or edit videos in PowerPoint.

### How to Trim a Video in PowerPoint

You can trip unnecessary content at the start or end of your video clip. However, you can only trim videos you have inserted from your PC, as this feature is not yet available for videos on the web. Follow the steps below to learn how to trim video in PowerPoint.

1. If you are in a slide containing a media placeholder, click on Insert Video from File. A window will open; select the From a File option.
2. Find the video file on your PC and select it. Then, click the arrow that's right next to the Insert button. Choose either the Link to File or Insert option and your video will appear on the slide.
3. If you are not using a slide that has a media placeholder, find the Insert tab and click Video on My PC. You will be able to locate the video file on your PC.
4. You are now ready to trim video PowerPoint.
5. Select your video, and the Playback tab will appear. Navigate to the Editing area of the ribbon and hit the Trim Video button.

1. To adjust the start and end times in smaller increments, you can use the arrows you see on the sides of those boxes. If you know the exact times, enter them into the corresponding boxes.
2. You can also select the portion you would like to keep using the end and start time markers. In this case, sliding the red marker allows you to the end time while the green one lets you set the start time.

2. Hit the OK button once the portion of the video clip you want is all set. The video will appear on your slide update, and it will only play the section that you kept when trimming the video.

### How to Reset or Edit a Trimmed Video in PowerPoint

### How to Save a Trimmed Video

Now that you have trimmed your video in Microsoft PowerPoint, you might want to save it to use it outside this program. You can only save the video file after compressing it, then you can use the trimmed video as you want.

After compressing your trimmed video, only the trimmed section will show up on your slide. That said, follow the steps below to save your trimmed video:

1. From the PowerPoint menu, select File > Info
2. Next, select the Compress Media option.
3. Next to Compress Media, you will see all media that are in your slideshow, including your trimmed video. If you've got other video files here, the compression process will apply to these files.
4. Choose the suitable level of compression. A dialog box will pop up as the compression process takes place. Hit the Close button when this process completes.
5. Go back to the slide that contains your trimmed video, which has now been compressed.
6. Right-click the compressed video, and select the Save Media As option.

3. Pressing the Shift key on your keyboard while dragging will give you different results. You can also use the Shift and Ctrl keys simultaneously to combine both capabilities.
4. You can reposition the crop by either moving the video itself or the crop area.
5. Crop the unwanted portion by hitting the Crop button again or pressing the Enter key. You can also click on the Slide Area to apply the cropping changes.
6. You can access more crop options by right-clicking the video, where a contextual menu will appear. Select the Format Video option.

![learn to crop video in microsoft powerpoint ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/trim-video-in-powerpoint-11.png)

#### How to Play Video Inside a Shape

If you want to edit your video and enhance its appearance, you can have it play inside a unique shape instead of the usual rectangle format that videos play in. In turn, you'll draw attention to your video.

To play your video in an unusual shape, select your video and navigate to the Format tab. Then, go to the Video Shape menu, where you'll see multiple shapes to choose from.

![how to play videos inside a shape in microsoft powerpoint ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/trim-video-in-powerpoint-12.png)

#### How to Apply Preset Video Styles

Applying preset video styles is a simple process. Select the video, then navigate to the Format tab. Click More under the Video Style section. You'll see a gallery of preset styles; roll your mouse over it and hold the cursor over any style type. The program will apply a live preview of this style to your video.

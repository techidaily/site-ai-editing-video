## Part 5\. Which One Is Better? MKV or MOV?

MKV file format is not as commonly used as MOV because of its poor compatibility when it comes to mobile devices. If we talk about the file size, MKV tends to have a larger file size as compared to other used formats. MOV is a container file format that can store multiple media files of different tracks. Whereas MKV is an envelope format, even supporting to store complete movies with subtitles.

MKV format was developed by Matroska, whereas Apple developed the MOV file format. MKV format is good for storing HD videos, and MOV format is great for saving movies.

### Last Words

MKV format is a container format that can store different files with different encodings. The article above has discussed the file format in detail.

## How Long Does It Take To Edit A Video

If you want to put together the pieces for online videos the number one thing most of the time takes is **editing.**

**Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?**

* **Too many choices.**

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-11.jpg)

Let’s enjoy its advanced features without paying for monthly subscription.

## **3\.** **Davinci Resolve for Mac.**

The Davinci Resolve is the most professional video editing software on Mac. It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free. Along with this, it is very professional video editing software that people used to create Hollywood movies and that kind of stuff. It provides a very easy and professional interphase that anyone can use without having training.

* The controls and features in the software are amazing and can edit videos **frame by frame.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-12.jpg)

* There is also a dedicated area for **audio creation**.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-13.jpg)

* The **motion graphics** and

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-14.jpg)

* A specific area just for **color grading** and **color correcting.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-15.jpg)

That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a **finishing application** of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

## **How to Edit Video Faster with the Best Video Editor**

Filmora 11 is one of the easiest to learn and one of the most beginner-friendly apps. It is available on both Mac and windows. You can download it for free to use its features. Now let’s get started to go deep down into the steps.

* The **Create Project** is for a new project.

* To start with a new project hit the **New Project**.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-1.jpg)

In the user interphase, there are 3 basic sections.

1. **Editing tabs** are at the top to change the formatting of the videos.
2. **Media tab** is to Import videos or photos.

* **Preview window** to watch the editing process.

1. Down here is the **timeline** where all the editing process takes place.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-2.jpg)

* Select the video from the system storage and drag it and drop it into the timeline.
* The video then be visible in the preview window.

You can split, cut, trim, delete, animate, and add effects and music. There are hundreds of editing features inside the menu bar that provide the edit controls and you can enjoy editing in the palm of your hand.

Here is an important feature you should know.

* Select the video and hit the **speed**
* You can select **slow, fast, normal,** and the most interesting one is **speed ramping.**
* **Speed ramping** allows you to set automatically made patterns to slow down then fast again slow. It will create a cinematic effect in the video. But this feature is only for paid users.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-4.jpg)

* Here is another very interesting tool the color correction tool. To get a uniform color in the combination of different clips, you can automatically set the **color correction** and **color match.**
* You can match the reference frame with the current to match their colors.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-5.jpg)

* Hit the **File** option and select the **Save as Project.**
* Now hit the **Export** tab to export the video. You can set the format of the video and the platform like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, or any of them.

## How To Make a Video Podcast

Starting a video podcast can be quite intimidating, but the truth is; having the proper knowledge will help you do things more correctly.

As we all know, knowledge is the key to success. So, for you to navigate your way around the video podcasting industry easily, you need to consume enough information that will enable you to make fewer wrong decisions.

To help you out, we took our time to do more research on how to record video podcasts, and in this post, we will share all you need to know to record a video podcast that stands out.

## Part 1\. But first: why record with a video?

If you've done a little research, you'll notice many podcasters switched to recording with videos instead of audio. Did they decide to start doing that so we could see their faces? Well, the answer is NO. But before we discuss more on that, you should know what a video podcast is and its types.

You guessed right. A video podcast is a podcast with video. The video element could be a static image or a video recording of the podcast host and the guest. A video podcast will help you do the following;

**1\. Enhance the visual content**

Research shows that humans learn more from what they visualize than what is heard. Yes, this is because 30% of the human brain comprises neurons dedicated to visual processing, and just 3% is dedicated to hearing. Besides, videos are always more engaging compared to audio. So why not combine both to boost your podcast performance?

**2\. Level up the personality and relatability**

Most people have more belief in what they see than what is heard. So, video podcasts allow audiences to easily see your expression and understand your passion for the subject you discuss. It also builds a deeper level of connections between you and them. Also, it helps to add to the originality of your podcast and your brand as a whole.

**3\. Make the content more accessible**

Your podcast show becomes more accessible when it's in the video. You won't be limited to just uploading it on podcast platforms but also on social media as a short TikTok trailer, Instagram post, YouTube video, etc. Doing this will get your content in front of a wide range of audience, thus prompting more people to engage with your podcast.

## Part 2\. Get your gear set up

The first step to starting a video podcast is getting your gear set up. We recommend you start with the following podcast equipment:

* A camera (if recording a video podcast)
* Microphone(s)
* Headphone(s)
* Memory cards
* Tripods
* Computers
* Recording software or a digital audio workstation

Let's dig deeper into each of these. We've compiled the best podcast equipment for beginners and pros alike based on our extensive research.

### 1\. Depth & lighting

To make a professional-looking video podcast, you need to add as much depth as possible. So yes, there should be enough distance between you and the background (don't be too close or too far). However, if this is impossible because you have a small space, good lighting should spice things up. Godox SL -150 is one perfect choice that you can opt for.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

### 3\. Declutter

It's never a good idea to leave unnecessary items in the background because that makes it look messy. Also, it may compromise everything you've done to spice it up. So, after you finish putting up an exciting background, take a few minutes to inspect the lighting, the elements, and lots more. Then, ensure it's clean and tidy.

## Part 4\. Create a collaborative doc

* **Niche or Topic**
* **Brand name**

* **Intro and Outro Music**
* **Create a Cover Art**
* **Ideas to record the first podcast**

## Part 5\. Create your show

We'll walk you through the steps of the process for each process. Just keep reading;

Thankfully, a video podcast allows you to upload a short clip of your show to different social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc. With this, your show will become more accessible across various platforms, thus increasing your show's engagement. Honestly, it's a win-win!

## The Bottom Line

There you have it! Just like that, you're ready to be a part of the top-rated video podcasters you can ever think of. With all that's discussed in the article, we believe you can now focus on creating valuable and engaging content for your audience.

However, as you start to record video podcasts, we advise you to invest in the right marketing tools to help you gain more attraction in the industry.

Your podcast gear setup isn't complete without video podcast software. Yes, this one is also essential, as it's required for performing podcast recording editing to spice up your videos. Wondershare Filmora is an ideal choice for anyone to edit podcast content with high quality!

## Part 3\. Build your set

Besides having a good quality camera and other podcast gear mentioned above, it's also crucial to make your set look gorgeous. It makes your video podcast look more professional. Below are ideas for some techniques you can employ.

### 1\. Depth & lighting

To make a professional-looking video podcast, you need to add as much depth as possible. So yes, there should be enough distance between you and the background (don't be too close or too far). However, if this is impossible because you have a small space, good lighting should spice things up. Godox SL -150 is one perfect choice that you can opt for.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

### 3\. Declutter

It's never a good idea to leave unnecessary items in the background because that makes it look messy. Also, it may compromise everything you've done to spice it up. So, after you finish putting up an exciting background, take a few minutes to inspect the lighting, the elements, and lots more. Then, ensure it's clean and tidy.

## Part 4\. Create a collaborative doc

Creating a collaborative doc is also essential for making a podcast. You might ask: "what is a collaborative doc?" Well, it's where you jot down information on the following;

* **Niche or Topic**
* **Brand name**
* **Format for the Show and each of the Episodes**
* **Intro and Outro Music**
* **Create a Cover Art**
* **Ideas to record the first podcast**

## Part 5\. Create your show

Now that you have a perfect plan and setup, the next thing is to start the show. But first, what format have you chosen for your first show? Is it the static image recording? The remote interview recording? The in-studio recording? or interview & b-roll recording? Not sure of which format to start with? Worry less. We'll walk you through the steps of the process for each process. Just keep reading;

### Method 1: Static Image Podcast Recording

![static image podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-8.jpg)

It is the simplest way to record a video podcast. You don't necessarily have to show your face. Instead, record an audio podcast, then convert its file into a video file and add a static image to the background to keep playing as the viewer is listening.

You need video editing software to create this kind of video podcast - Filmora is a perfect choice. However, keep in mind that this kind of video podcast is usually less engaging, only that you'll be able to publish it on various video platforms.

**Equipment Required:**

* Video editor - Filmora
* Computer

### Method 2: In-studio Podcast Recording

![in-studio podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-9.jpg)

Unlike static image recording, this kind of video podcast requires you to show in the video. It involves capturing the conversation between you and a guest or your colleague from a perfectly set up studio.

**Equipment required:**

* Camera
* Microphone
* Tripod (if you have nobody to stay behind the camera)
* Computer
* Headphones
* Video editing software - Filmora

### Method 3: Remote Interview Podcast Recording

![remote interview podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-10.jpg)

**Equipment Required:**

* Software that supports capturing multiple webcams. An example is Riverside.
* Microphone
* Computer

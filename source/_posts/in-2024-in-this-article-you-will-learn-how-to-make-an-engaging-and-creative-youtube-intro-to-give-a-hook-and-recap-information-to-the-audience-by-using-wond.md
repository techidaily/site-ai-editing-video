## Dubbing Videos With Voiceovers | Using Wondershare Filmora

Voiceovers have been a great utility in the digital ecosystem for a while. From movies to videos, the use of voiceovers has provided content creators with new dynamics. While it has enhanced the quality of video creation, there are other technicalities that have arisen against it. In this article, we will be discussing the details involving voiceovers and recordings.

Also, it includes a discussion of tools that can be used to ensure professional voice recordings. Go through the provided details to know how to utilize voiceovers to perfection.

## Part 1: What is The Difference Between Voice Recording and Voiceover?

Do you know **voiceover** and voice recording are two different terms? They are often used correspondingly but have different meanings. Here are a few differences between the two in the section below:

**Voice Recording**

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations. Ultimately, we can say that voiceover is a part of voice recording that should be synchronized with the visual media to fulfill its purpose.

**Automatically Generate Text-to-Speech**

## Part 2: How is Voiceover Beneficial in Video Editing?

As we all know, narration in a video is essential as it adds a character to your video. There are many options, like [AI voice text-to-speech](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) tools, to generate voiceovers. Regardless, do you know why voiceovers are considered beneficial in video editing? Let’s look ahead into some prominent benefits of using voiceovers:

### 1\. Narrative and Information

Voiceover provides a narrative element to a video. This further guides the viewers through the content and conveys important information. It also allows you to explain concepts, provide context, or tell a story to your engaged audience.

### 2\. Clarity and Comprehension

This also helps clarify complex concepts by providing a verbal explanation. It ensures that viewers can easily understand the message or purpose of the video. Even if the visuals alone are insufficient, text-to-speech generators can help. Moreover, voiceover adds an additional layer of information that can aid comprehension.

### 3\. Storytelling and Emotional Impact

It allows you to add emotions, tone, and personality to the video. Furthermore, it can set the mood to create a connection with the audience. A well-executed voiceover can also improve the storytelling aspect of the video. Similarly, people tend to memorize such videos which have an impactful speech or voice recording.

### 4\. Professionalism and Polishing

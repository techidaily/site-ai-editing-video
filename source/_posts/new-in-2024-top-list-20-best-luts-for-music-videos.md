## Part 1\. How to Add Text Animation in After Effects

You may roughly follow the instructions in this article and produce a similar effect with After Effects if you are familiar with that application and prefer it for graphics and animations. Using Adobe AE, let's demonstrate how to make a text animation effect.

### 1\. After Effects' Fly-in Text Animation

Fortunately, creating this type of effect inside of Adobe AE is really fairly simple and doesn't need downloading and installing any other templates. For those who are knowledgeable with AE and want to create the effect, that is a significant bonus.

**Steps to Add Fly-in Text Animation in AE:**

Step1 The first step is adding your Title Layer to a Comp that has a colorful backdrop and create a route for the text to follow using the Pen tool.

![title layer styles premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/title-layer-styles-premiere.jpg)

Step2 In the next step, rotate the Text menu, Path Options, and Layer down. Using the Pen Tool, change the path to the mask you just created. To advance a few frames, use your keyboard's directional keys.

![select pen tool premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-pen-tool-premiere.jpg)

Step3 Afterwards, set a Keyframe for First Margin at frame 0; reduce the value to whatever is appropriate for your Path and change the First Margin value to 0 at frame 30 to center the text on the path's length.

![key frmae margin premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/key-frmae-margin-premiere.jpg)

Step4 Lastly, give this keyframe an Easy Ease to setup the Fly-in text animation.

### 2\. After Effects Typewriter Animation

A great pre-set for animators wishing to produce effects of text on paper is Typewriter Text Presets. The Bevel settings, which let you create the essential indentation effect, are more stunning than the pre-speed set's control. A fun and simple method to show titles in your films is using typewriter effects. While the classic typewriter effect could seem a bit antiquated, combining it with additional text effects will result in something fresh and interesting.

**Steps to Add Typewriter Animation in After Effects:**

Step1 In the Media Viewer, choose the Text tool and enter your title. Then, use the Character panel to change the font, color, and size.

##### Step2 Add Texts and Titles Presets

Select the Annotations tab from the menu on the left side of the screen. Double-clicking the default text will allow you to replace it with your own. You may change the hue and opacity by selecting the properties option on the right side, based on your preferences and how well they go with the movie.

##### Step3 Create Your Animated Text

Adjust your text and lower third length to the longest name or title that will be typed on the same toolbar as the Annotations tab. This makes it possible to maintain a constant text size and length throughout your whole movie. You may modify the layers you've made to suit your preferences and the way your movie flows best.

##### Step4 Add Keyframing

Use animated effects and keyframing to give your films life and movement. It simplifies animation and enables rapid application of adjustments like expanding, rotating, narrowing, etc. Simply choose the beginning and ending keyframes, and Filmora will add all the intermediate frames automatically while preserving coherence. Keyframes may be altered by adjusting their position, transparency, size, etc.

##### Step5 Export the Animated Content

When you're through wanting to add the text animations to your projects, just click the Export button in the top-right portion of the screen as shown below to export them as a GIF.

In addition to the GIF export option in the export box, you may choose to share your creation with just one click on your official YouTube account.

## Part 3\. Related FAQs About Text Animations

### 1\. How do you make words move in After Effects?

In the Composition panel, choose the exact characters you wish to animate, or choose a text layer in the Timeline panel. Choose one of these: Select a property from the menu by selecting Animation > Animate Text. Use Animate. To animate a parameter, click the button to the right of the term "Animate." A Text Animator will be applied to the text after a parameter has been selected.

### 2\. How do you make 3D text in After Effects?

To begin, enter a word using the Type tool (T). To activate 3D on a layer, utilize the Switches/Modes toggle to examine the switches in the timeline and turn on the 3D Layer switch to the layer's right. When a layer is enabled for 3D, options to move it in 3D space and change the layer's appearance in the composition are made available.

### 3\. How to make logo animation in After Effects?

In After Effects, you may add your animation to the render queue as usual and choose "png sequence" from the output module options. Choose the 3D layer you wish to rotate. To find out if the Rotation tool affects Orientation or Rotation attributes, choose the Rotation tool and select Orientation or Rotation from the Set menu.

## The Bottom Line

Text animation may be obtained in a variety of methods. Text presets in After Effects are simple-to-use presets that may be applied to text layers, if you are not already acquainted with them. With the help of this manual, it is now incredibly simple to use and add animation flavor to the text and videos with little effort especially with the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) solution.

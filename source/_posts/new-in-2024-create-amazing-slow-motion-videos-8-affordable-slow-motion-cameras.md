![adobe after effects intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg)

After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe's Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.

### Canva

When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere. In addition to providing, you with intro templates, it also gives you the ability to design your own logo.

Canva's mission is to demystify graphic design and make it available to users who are not designers. They also provide a premium edition of Canva, which is ideally suited for teams to collaborate on the creation of designs with the same objective in mind. In addition, Canva Pro is equipped with additional premium features, such as a brand kit and a backdrop remover.

![canva intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

Canva is an easy-to-use website that provides free access to some of its features, which may be used to create great movies. However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.

When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.

We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.

You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.

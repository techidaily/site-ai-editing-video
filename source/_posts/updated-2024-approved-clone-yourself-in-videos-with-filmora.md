## How to Clone Yourself in Videos with Filmora?

With the help of video editing programs like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can create clones of yourself. Whether you're looking to create a funny skit or a serious video, cloning yourself can add much production value to your project.

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of how to clone yourself in videos using Filmora.

## Part 1: How to Film Clips for Cloning Effects?

To make cloning effects, you will need to take two different shots and use a tripod to place the camera, so the frame doesn't change.

**Shooting the first clip**

For the first shot, stay on one side of the frame and do the first action. For example, you can pretend to yank and take off your jacket. Then, drop the jacket to the other side of the frame.

![shooting the first clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-1.gif)

To make it more realistic, make an interaction by reacting to the "clone" while facing the other direction.

![make an interaction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-2.jpg)

**Shooting the second clip**

Then, shoot for the second clip without changing the frame. You will have to go to the place where you dropped the jacket from the first shot.

![shooting the second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-3.gif)

Act as if you have just appeared there and give a reaction to the other side as well.

## Part 2: How to Do the Clone Effect with Filmora?

After you have shot the necessary film clips, bring the clips into Filmora 11\. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can go to their website and download it here:

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Once you have opened Filmora 11, follow the steps below:

Step1 Bring the first clip to the timeline and cut the clip where you pretend to yank and take off the jacket. Select and delete the unnecessary clip.

![bring the first clip to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg)

Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let's start working on the clone part using masking.

First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the "clone."

![place the second clip on a different window track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg)

Then, double-click the second clip and go to the Filmora setting window. Tap on the **Mask** section > **Single line**.

![tap on mask section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-6.jpg)

On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show "the clone."

![adjust the position of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif)

Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.

Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn't match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11\. To use it, double-click the second clip and select **Speed > Speed Ramping > Customize**.

![double-click the second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-8.jpg)

Move the keyframe up to increase the speed. You can adjust it according to your needs.

![adjust keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-9.gif)

Step4 Once you are satisfied, adjust the clip length on the timeline and make sure that both clips finish at the same time.

![adjust the clip length](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-10.jpg)

**Extra tip:** Add one more effect to make it more magical.

Step1 Open the **Effects** window and search for "up down 1."

![open the effects window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-11.jpg)

Step2 Drag and drop the effect onto the timeline where the first cut is set. Adjust the effect length to match the action.

![drag and drop the effect onto the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-12.jpg)

Then, drag and drop the effect again in the transition between the first and the second clip. Adjust it to the appropriate length, then it will give a more dramatic effect.

Step3 You can playback and see how it looks on the preview screen.

## Tips for Choosing Location and Scheduling Music Video

Making viral music videos is everyone's dream; what if you get exact tips to follow before shooting your music video to make it high-ranked? Obviously, it'll be a treat for you!

Planning and preparing before the shoot is the key to making a music video successful. You can only achieve this after location scouting and emerging with the best one. And scheduling for big projects before the day is more important. Let's directly move towards the things to consider before shooting!

## Location scouting

The pleasant and eye-catchy location always makes your music video trending or flopping. You should first go with your budget and then come up with location ideas. In the upcoming tip, we will use 3lau's song "Tokyo" as an example.

![finding the right location for the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/finding-the-right-location-for-the-music-video.jpg)

If you are going with large projects, you need to consider the following requirements!

### 1\. Availability of electricity

You need rig lights and a large lighting setup to make your video more glow and give them aesthetic vibes. For this, make sure you choose a location where light is readily available.

### 2\. Separate room

During shooting for big projects, you need room to store all gear and sensitive equipment in one place for many days.

![separate room to store gears](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/separate-room-to-store-gears.jpg)

### 3\. Check the size

The foremost thing in choosing the location is to check the Height and Width of the studio. They should be enough to rig the lights in the studio easily and place every required thing in a decided space.

For Example, while shooting a 3lau song, there is a need for a bus to come into the studio easily, but there is an issue in entering the bus due to height issues of the door. Due to this, the director changed the location at the spot to sort out this issue.

![check the size of the studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/check-the-size-of-the-studio.jpg)

## Alternate Ways of Location Scouting

If you don't have enough budget to get a studio space, then you can easily shoot by selecting spaces that are in your use or available. These are the following locations you should regard!

### Location 1\. Your Home

You should go with the space available at your home to shoot, such as: on couches or in the bedroom, to give a good impression to your music video.

### Location 2\. Office Space

You can also make scenes of your music video in office space to better describe the work in the video.

![office space for shooting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/office-space-for-shooting.jpg)

### Location 3\. Outdoor Locations

For better daylight and illustrations in the music video, you can go with the outdoor location, which is free of cost.

![outdoor location for shooting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/outdoor-location-for-shooting.jpg)

### Location 4\. Public Places

Public places are easily available and have many options, such as public parks, playgrounds, bridges, and public parking.

![public places for music videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/public-places-for-music-videos.jpg)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** During public shooting, ensure that the space is empty, and there should be no interruption of the public in filming the shots.

![public interruption in shots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/public-interruption-in-shots.jpg)

The weather is also a major factor when shooting a video, which you must check before the shoot days. After selecting and scouting the location, now it's time to make a schedule which you'll get in hand in the below lines!

## Scheduling for the Music Video

If you have a big project and more scenes to shoot, it's better to make a whole plan about each and everything. You have to make a schedule of using even a single light at a specific time and space. The following are the main considerations you should take care of!

### 1\. Pre-Rig Day

You need to come to the setup before the filming day to check the main things like electricity, measure exact spaces, check the lightning setup, loaded everything such as the bus, crew, and gears.

![loaded and checked everything on the pre rig day](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/loaded-and-checked-everything-on-the-pre-rig-day.jpg)

### 2\. A Call Sheet

A call sheet is a daily shot list given to the cast and crew to follow the timelines, and it contains the phone number of everyone, their location, and the time to arrive on set. It also includes the nearest hospital, sunset, and sun-rising timing.

![call sheet of tokyo song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/call-sheet-of-tokyo-song.jpg)

It consists of one to two pages according to shoot days and has a plan of everything that happens after the Pre-Rig day.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** When you wrap up for day 1, you have another call sheet for day 2, day 3, and so on!

### 3\. Do Planning

You need to work efficiently and smartly to maintain everything according to the plan. You can cut the filming into halves to have a better lighting setup and character availability. On the shot day, you must change the lighting and rigging setup as little as possible.

**Examples**

On day 1 of the Tokyo song, the filming is done in two halves; the first half day goes towards filming everything in the bus, and the other half day, there is a shoot of everything outside the bus.

While in day 2, there is a filming of every memory. For this, there are setups of rooms and homes for making perfect shots according to the requirements of a music video.

![day 2 of filming tokyo song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/day-2-of-filming-tokyo-song.gif)

### 4\. Take No Stress

You should not blow up and take stress during shoot day because it'll obviously cause chaos in every little scene and give a bad impression to the music video. You just should work hard and get all done.

## Conclusion

After checking and following the above tips for location scouting and scheduling, you'll obviously come up with an amazing filming setup and music video. There is no need to worry, just get the whole planning and then do all scenes one after the other patiently.

Filming with people is not always bulky and flopping, but if you have a cooperative team and follow all the timelines of shooting. Then you'll rock the music video!

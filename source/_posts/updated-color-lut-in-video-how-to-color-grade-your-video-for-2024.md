#### • To ensure uniformity across different devices

You will use a calibration color lut to ensure a similar video quality across different TV monitors whether it is HD, UHD, or 4K. Similarly, you can use a transformation colour lut to add a cinematic effect to your film to make it appear as if your audience is viewing it in a theatre.

Camera manufacturers use different color luts to diversify their products according to their target markets. For example, you get a different lut color grading from a Sony camera as you would in a Canon.

**User's Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint**

## Create True 3D Text Effects Using After Effects

Every video creator wants to make their videos eye-catching and get the message delivered to the viewers properly. If you have regular graphic elements and texts, your video is not going to be as engaging as expected. That is why video creators always try to include trending and attention-grabbing effects and animations in the video. There is no doubt that 3D animations for texts and titles look really amazing.

Different video editors have different 3D text animations and effects that you can apply to the text on your video and get instantly noticed by your viewers. You can apply 3D text animation on premium video editors like After Effects as well as apply 3D text effect online. We will illustrate how to create stunning 3D text animations with different video editors in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Create True 3D Text Effects using After Effects

After Effects is a premium video editor where you can create true 3D text effect from scratch. First of all, you need to create a new composition and add your text to your video. You have to enable 3D option for the text and add depth and lighting texture to get 3D effect. Therefore, you should first create 3D text effect and thereafter, animate 3D text as per your preference. Here are the steps to create 3D text After Effects easily.

Step1Launch After Effects and click on New Composition from Project section. Set the different parameters on Composition Settings and click on Ok button.

![new composition after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/new-composition-after-effects.jpg)

![rotate text after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/rotate-text-after-effects.jpg)

Step4Similarly, click on Geometry Options and add depth to your text to get 3D effect on your text.

![click geometry after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-geometry-after-effects.jpg)

Step5You have to create a new Camera layer by right-clicking Timeline and go to New>Camera option. You will get Camera Settings window to adjust the parameters and click on Ok button.

![new camera layer after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/new-camera-layer-after-effects.jpg)

![rotate text with orbit tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/rotate-text-with-orbit-tool.jpg)

Step7You need to get the lighting and shading for your 3D text. Right-click on Comp window and go to New> Light. Adjust the parameters from Light Settings window.

![adjust light after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adjust-light-after-effects.jpg)

![add transform after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-transform-after-effects.jpg)

You have successfully created 3D text effect on After Effects. You will now illustrate how to animate the 3D text.

## Part 2\. Create 3D Camera Animation

You have prepared your text with 3D effect, and you can have multiple 3D texts on your video. It is time to animate those 3D texts so that the 3D effect becomes more prominent and the text instantly grabs attention. You do not have to create animation from scratch as there are 3D animation presets available. All you need to do is apply them to your 3D texts and they will start to animate automatically. Besides, you can create 3D camera animation to show the texts from different camera perspectives. Here are the steps to use 3d animated text generator on After Effects.

Step1Once you have created your 3D text effect, go to Effects & Presets panel.

Step2Go to Text> 3D Text and you will see all the different 3D animation presets that you can apply.

![preview 3d text animation presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/preview-3d-text-animation-presets.jpg)

Step3Drag and drop your desired 3D animation directly to 3D text layer.

Step4If you want camera animation on your 3D text, select the Camera layer you already created. Press C to get the Orbit tool to get the starting position of the 3D text. You can also use Dolly tool and Pan & Zoom tool for adjustment.

![get start position 3d text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-start-position-3d-text.jpg)

Step5Now add a keyframe on Position option from Transform option to mark the starting point of the animation. Similarly, add another keyframe where you want the animation to end.

![add keyframe position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-keyframe-position.jpg)

Step6Use the Orbit tool, Dolly tool and others to position 3D text as per how you want the animation to end.

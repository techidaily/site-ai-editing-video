Do you ever wish to get your video's slow motion removed? How to convert slow-motion video to normal on an iPhone? Well, here's your answer.

### Method 1\. Using the Photos App

## Part 5: Best Slow Motion Converters to Convert Video to Slow Motion Online Free?

### 1\. [Online Converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com/change-video-speed)

This tool can also change the video speed by increasing (speeding up) or decreasing (slowing down). The audio in the video file will also become faster or slower due to using this tool.

**Step 1**: click on the **Choose File** option from the website to upload the video (max. 200MB).

**Step 2:** Now select the **Speed** of the video from the given options. Since we are going to make a video with slow motion effect, choose 0.5x or 0.8x will work perfectly.

## Part 6: How to Convert Normal Video to Smooth Slow Motion In iPhone And Android Phones

In addition to the essential editing tools of the famous social media platform, TikTok, CapCut is [mobile video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for both Android and iOS smartphones that were mainly built to complement them. Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:

**Step 1**: **Create A New Project** on the CapCut app's home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.

**Step 2**: When you're ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the **Mute clip audio** button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.

![ mute video audio capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-capcut.jpg)

**Step 3:** In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the **Split** button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.

**Step 4**: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the **Speed** menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.

![ speed option in capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg)

**Step** **5:** In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, **Normal** and **Curve**, respectively. You may just choose the "**Normal**" option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video's frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the **Check** box.

![ change speed  in capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-capcut-normal.jpg)

## Step by Step to Rotate Videos Using Handbrake

Handbrake is a video editing tool that allows you to rotate videos. It is a free and open source software that is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is used to convert video files from one format to another. You can use it to compress videos, add subtitles, or create chapters. It also allows you to rotate videos in different directions. You can use it to fix videos that are not aligned properly or that have been filmed upside down. A handbrake is a popular tool because it is easy to use and it has a variety of features.

## Step-by-step on how to rotate videos using Handbrake

When you import a video into the Handbrake software, it will by default be in a "landscape" orientation, with the long edge of the video oriented horizontally. If you want to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise so that it appears "vertical," or if you want to rotate it 180 degrees so that it is upside down, you can do so by following these two steps:

Step 1: Open the Handbrake software and import your video.

Step 2: Click on the "Dimensions" tab at the top of the Handbrake window.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-2.png)

Step 3: Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, click on one of the options in the "Rotate" menu.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-3.png)

Step 4: If you want to rotate a video 90 degrees counterclockwise, select "90 Degrees CW (Counter-Clockwise)." If you want to rotate the video 180 degrees so that it is upside down, select "180 Degrees."

Step 5: Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-5.png)

The Handbrake software also offers a "Flip" option which you can do after rotating it, which allows you to slip the video after rotating it. To use this option, follow these steps:

Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, Go to Rotation and choose the degrees that best is best for your rotation requirements.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-6.png)

Click on "Flip" to flip your video horizontally.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-7.png)

Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

Both of these methods for rotating videos are easy to use and produce good results. Experiment with them to see which method works best for you.

## Free Ways to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures: No Copyright

The digital landscape is bustling with content creators showcasing their talent, brands promoting their products, and educators teaching various skills. Amidst all this digital hustle, have you ever stopped to wonder how some creators seamlessly integrate themselves into dreamy, otherworldly, or even fantastical backgrounds?

How does one moment show them standing in their living room, and the next, they’re strolling through the sandy beaches of the Maldives or floating in space?

The answer to these mesmerizing effects is the magic of green screens.

* [Part2: Free Websites to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures](#part2)

## Part1:What is Green Screen Footages and Application Scenarios

The concept of the green screen, or the green screen mobile frame, isn't new. Hollywood has used it for decades to transport actors to distant planets, into the heart of battles, or atop treacherous mountain peaks. The principle is simple: film your subject against a vibrant green backdrop, then use software to replace that green with any video or image you choose.

So, why green?

The color green is distinct, easily distinguishable, and not typically worn as a primary color in clothing. This makes it simpler for software to isolate and replace without accidentally morphing the subject into the new background. The result is a clean, nearly flawless integration of the subject with whatever setting or scene you can imagine.

But it’s not just about transporting subjects to new locations. A green screen mobile frame or video green screen frame allows for interactive presentations, imaginative storytelling, and even sophisticated effects, like adding dynamic weather elements or supernatural phenomena. It can turn a static, dull scene into something vibrant, interactive, and engaging.

**Application Scenarios:**

1. **Entertainment & Films:** This is the most obvious. From massive Hollywood productions to amateur short films, green screens create different worlds, enhance scenes with visual effects, or simply transport characters to diverse locations.
2. **Education:** Educators use green screens for virtual field trips or to create interactive lessons, making learning more dynamic and interesting.
3. **Gaming & Streaming:** Have you ever seen a game streamer with just their figure visible over the gameplay? That's a green screen at work.
4. **Digital Marketing:** Brands use it to produce compelling ads without the hefty cost of actual locations or sets.
5. **Social Media Content:** TikTokers, YouTubers, and Instagram influencers employ green screens to add a layer of creativity and uniqueness to their content, standing out in the ever-crowded space.

The magic of green screens is everywhere, bridging the gap between imagination and reality. With the rise of accessible technology and software, what was once restricted to big-budget studios is now at the fingertips of anyone with a camera, a green cloth, and a vision. And with the platforms we're about to delve into, sourcing green screen mobile frame HD content has never been easier. So, ready to jump into this world?

## Create Chroma Key Written Text Effects in Filmora

Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.

## Part 1\. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?

Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.

![chroma key text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png)

Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it's an easy way to make 3D motion videos.

To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:

## Part 2\. Filming Tips for Written Texts

To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.

### Tip 1\. A Pen and a White Paper

We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.

We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:

![purple color pen on white paper](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png)

It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it's more apparent during filming.

### Tip 2\. Different Color Paper

There are many chances that you don't have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don't need to worry because you can use different color papers too.

But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.

![different color paper with different markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don't use dull color pens with bright color paper.

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

### Tip 4\. Larger Size of Letters

As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

![the larger size of the written key text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-5.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.

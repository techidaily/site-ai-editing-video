## If You Are a Teacher or People Who Want to Share Their Ideas via Vides, You Can Always Make It on Your Own. This Article Will Share You 7 Tips to Create an Educational Video Easily

For many teachers, online classes begin with a live recording of their lectures or lessons. Sending the recorded lectures to the students allows them to pause the video and rewatch it multiple times.

Recording lectures before class can assist lecturers in filling gaps that may arise due to your absence. You don't have to worry about missing lessons if you're going on vacation or to be sick for an extended time.

![create teaching video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-teaching-video.jpg)

You can keep the class continuing even if you are absent by using pre-recorded lectures and sending the file to the class, so they know the lesson. With the help of an online lecture software or tool available on the internet, you can download it free.

These are the steps in creating an instructional video in your classes:

## Know Your Target Audience

Before you record the video to present in your classes, you need to **know your target audience**. We all know that some teachers handle grade school, and some handle high school level. We need to discover what kind of knowledge or skills your students hope to gain in your class learning the topic you presented. Try to use your book, or maybe add some research and then use that information to help you discuss with your students.

![know your target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg)

Things you need to remember before you proceed to the next step:

* Who is your audience? We, educators, already know our audience. It depends on the school and what level we are going to handle. It's either grade school level or high school level.
* What is your topic/s? There are a lot of topics and subjects in the field of teaching but try to pick only one topic or subject to present to your class. For example, Computer Subject because I'm a computer teacher. I will be using this subject or topic about computers to create my instructional video for the class.
* What is the learning objective or learning outcome of your video? The learning objective of your video is the outcome that captures precisely what knowledge, skills, and attitudes the students should be able to exhibit following the instructions.
* How will your video benefit your audience? The students will learn and understand the lesson you are discussing, helping them gain knowledge of that subject to answer all the assignments, quizzes, or maybe an activity you will give them.

## Write a Script

Once you know your audience and have the topic you need, it's time to **write a script**. Think about your plan for presenting your video in your classes.

![write video script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/write-video-script.jpg)

* Here are a few more writing script tips to help you in your classes:

Go to the mirror and practice. This tip may help some teachers instead of calling their loved ones and getting feedback about the script they write.

* Explain what you're doing and why you're doing it. You are not only presenting the topic and explaining it but also showing the class what the topic is all about, which will be suitable for your students. Present some examples, pictures, or videos for them to know better what your discussion is all about.
* Knowing your script 100% is important. Make sure that you already know your script before you record. If you forget something or make a mistake, go back to the beginning and repeat it correctly. Remember as a teacher that we are not allowed to make mistakes in the eyes of the students. So, double-check everything before you record it and show it to the class.

## Record the Narration

After writing your script, let's try to **record the narration**. You don't need any application software where you can record the narration. Simply using your mobile phone and having a good background is enough.

![record narration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/record-narration.jpg)

Using a microphone to record the narration is necessary. Getting those headphones with one connected microphone is good. Some of that has noise cancellation, providing a much better sound quality while recording and ensuring that your videos don't contain background noise. Then, find a quiet place to record. Explain to your family members that no one will ever talk loud or shout while you are recording the narration.

Once you are ready to hit that record button, speak clearly. Nobody is perfect, so it's ok if you make a mistake. You don't need to start over, just pause and start again. You can remove the error or mistake by editing your finished product. Make sure your narration will be the same on the screen while recording your video.

## Record and Edit your Video

The first thing you need to do in **recording your video** is to clean up your computer screen and close all the unnecessary applications. You need to turn off also the notifications that will pop up on your computer before you start recording. You can also add your recorded narration to your video.

Here are a few simple tips for **editing your video**:

* Add some interactive elements like motions to highlight key points of your video.
* Adding music to your video is optional but may elevate a decent video to the next level. Pick something cheery. You want your audience to feel good while learning.

## The Video Duration

I'd say it's one of the first things students look at before they click the 'play' button of the video. It will benefit both teacher and the students if the video is brief and direct to the point. Some students are more likely to want a short video, or maybe let's focus on the time between 20 - 30 minutes video, where they can watch and learn on any platform, anytime. After that, you can add time by adding other pieces of information and giving activities and assignments.

## Be Yourself

Be yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes sometimes. Make sure that your personality shines throughout the video. Try to research how some teachers or maybe some speakers speak naturally and have a conversational manner with an enthusiastic tone.

When you are recording yourself talking, look right at the camera so students can feel eye contact with you, even if it is online. Sometimes we forget the words we need to say to the class, so try to prepare a note next to your webcam. The messages you prepare will help you don't look away from the camera all the time. Don't pretend to the class that you're reading something, just talk naturally as you would in real classrooms.

## Sharing your Video

Instead of sharing your recorded video with your students, you can also share it directly to online video platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo or save the video as a local file to upload on a social media platform. They can go there and watch the video. You can also upload your file to the school learning management system like Google Classroom. Please take note of this; before sending the recorded video to your students, share it with first to a few people to get some video feedback about what you created. This might help you ensure that your message is clear and that your video accomplishes your goals for your students.

There's a chance that your recorded video doesn't meet your requirements or you are not satisfied with that for the first time. Don't worry; try it again, even if you recorded it once or several times. You need to trust yourself by doing it because we are teachers; we are doing our best for the students to learn something from us.

## Step by Step to Add Border to Video Using Premiere Pro

The border is really important as it frames up all the video. It makes the video eye-catching and gives a vivid effect. It also fixes the automated cropping issues, especially on Instagram. Along with this, it helps the viewers to watch the video as you can add effects about fun, travel, guides and etc. accordingly. Adding a border is super easy and it’s not more than fun!

So let’s start…

## **How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro**

Today we are going to discuss how to add borders to the video clips or images in premiere pro. It’s pretty simple to make borders of different colors and sizes for your video clips.

So, here are the two different ways we can use to add borders to our videos or images.

1. Adding a border to the video using a grid effect
2. Adding a border to the video using the essential graphics panel

### **Way 1\.** **Using a Grid Effect**

While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.

Let’s start step by step.

* Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.
* Hit the **Effects** tab and write the **grid** in the search panel.
* Simply drag the **grid** option into the timeline of the videos.

* Select the **anchor value** to **0** for the x and y.
* Change the **size** to **width and height slider.**
* Change the **width** to **1920** and **height** to **1080**.

Now we have borders added as you can see below.

You can also change the width of the borders.

## Want to Add Subtitles to Netflix Videos in Your Preferred Language? Read This Article to Learn Two Different Methods for Uploading Custom Subtitles to Netflix

Netflix is the most popular streaming service in the world. It offers loads of movies and series that you can watch on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Over the years, Netflix has become a one-stop destination for watching movies and TV shows in different languages.

While the user base of Netflix is quite diverse, the platform offers subtitles in limited languages for most movies and series. Suppose you want to view a Korean Drama on Netflix with French subtitles. However, you found that French subtitles are unavailable for that Korean Drama. In such a case, you might wonder if adding custom subtitles to Netflix is possible.

Well, you can add subtitles to Netflix, and there are two different methods to do the same. This guide will help you learn both methods available for adding custom subtitles to Netflix. So, let's get started!

## Method 1\. Upload Your Custom Subtitle to Netflix

Before proceeding with this method, you must remember that it only works if you are a Netflix Premium user. Now, let's discuss how to add subtitles to Netflix with this method.

### Key Steps to Follow

Below are the steps for adding custom subtitles to Netflix.

Step 1 First of all, you need to install and add [Language Learning with Netflix & YouTube™](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/bekopgepchoeepdmokgkpkfhegkeohbl?hl=en-US) extension to your web browser (Chrome or Edge).

Step 2 Make sure the extension is activated.

Step 3 Download the .srt file that contains the subtitles in your preferred language for a particular movie or TV show.

Step 4 Open Netflix on a Chrome or Edge browser and sign into your account.

Step 5 Play the movie or TV show for which you have downloaded the subtitles.

Step 6 Within the Netflix player, you will see a settings icon left to the **Subtitles** icon. Click on it.

Step 7 Among the various setting options, you need to choose the screen and find the one with the label "Lower Subtitles (Mother Language)". You need to click on its field and select the "Upload Subtitle" option.

Step 8 You will see a pop-up window at the top of the screen where you need to click the "Choose File" button.

Step 9 You then need to navigate to the directory on your computer where you have downloaded the subtitles file, select it, and click the "Open" button.

Step 10 Click the "Okay" button to upload the subtitles to Netflix.

Step 11 Close the settings window and play the video. You can view the uploaded subtitles at the bottom of the player.

## Method 2\. Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Extensions

If you're not a Netflix Premium user, you can still add subtitles to Netflix with the help of certain browser extensions. We'll list them down and discuss the steps for using one of them; the basic steps for using all such extensions are pretty much the same.

### 1\. Substital

**Supported web browsers:** [C](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en)[hrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/substital/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/substital-add-subtitles-/dkkffblkjnedaekodhiblomkicklmjnp?source=sfwOPERA)

Substital is among the most popular extensions that allow you to add subtitles to several online on-demand video streaming platforms, including Netflix. It has more than 100K users on the Chome Web Store.

**Key Features**

* Offers a built-in subtitles search feature.
* Supports .srt files and .zip files containing subtitles in the .srt format.
* You can manually sync the subtitles with the video.
* It allows you to customize the appearance of subtitles.

**Steps to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Substital**

Following are the key steps to add custom subtitles to Netflix using the Substital extension:

Step 1 The first thing you need to do is to download and install the Substital extension on your browser.

Step 2 Open Netflix on the same browser and log in to your account.

Step 3 Play the movie or episode from a TV series for which you want to add custom subtitles.

Step 4 Download the subtitles file for the same movie or episode in your preferred language from the web.

Step 5 Now open the extensions menu in your browser and click on the Substital icon.

Step 6 You will see the name of the movie or TV show that you are watching on Netflix. Click on it.

Step 7 In this step, you need to drag and drop the subtitle file from your system (that you downloaded earlier) to the browser window.

Step 8 Finally, you can notice that the subtitles are loaded in the Netflix player.

### 2\. Super Netflix

**Web browsers:** [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-netflix/iakpdiefpdniabbekcbofaanjcpjkloe)

Super Netflix is yet another reliable extension to add subtitles to Netflix. Apart from adding custom subtitles, this extension allows you to change the video playback speed. Like Substital, the Super Netflix extension on Chrome Web Store also has 100K+ users.

**Key Features**

* It can help you avoid spoilers by blurring images and episode descriptions.
* You can use the extension to skip intros automatically.
* Offers 5 different video modes.
* You get the option to change the Netflix streaming server.

### 3\. Netflix SubStyler: customize subtitles

**Web browsers:** [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-substyler-customi/ggfifegigcpgkkpnpfbglofhnjcjmidd#:~:text=Netflix%20SubStyler%20%3A%20customize%20subtitles&text=Extension%20to%20customize%20captions%20and,by%20customizing%20Netflix%20subtitle%20style.)

Unlike the other two extensions mentioned above, Netflix SubStyler only allows you to change the styling of subtitles on Netflix. However, the thing that makes this extension worthy of your attention is that it comes loaded with several customization options.

**Key Features**

* You can choose a custom text color for the subtitles either with the help of an in-built color picker or by entering the RGB value of the color.
* The extension lets you add text outlines and change the size of the text.
* You can even add a text background and change its color and opacity.

## Bonus Tip: How to Edit and Add Subtitles to Videos Available Offline

In certain cases, you may want to edit the subtitles of videos probably because either the subtitles are not available for a certain part of the video, or they are not correct. So, if you want to edit subtitles of videos that you have downloaded with ease, you can consider using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![run filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-01.png)

Filmora is one of the most popular and powerful video editors out there. Developed by Wondershare, it allows you to import subtitle files in various formats, including .srt, and edit them directly. Some noteworthy features of Filmora for subtitles and video editing include the manual addition of subtitles, speech-to-text conversion, green screen, video stabilization, and color correction.

Wondershare Filmora also offers several advanced text editing tools that make it possible to customize the appearance of subtitles that you add to a video. You can change the color and size of the fonts and add a gradient effect to the text. Additionally, you can animate text to make it stand out.

### Add Custom Subtitles with Filmora: A Step-by-Step Guide

If you want to add subtitles to any video using Filmora, you simply need to follow the steps mentioned below. Please note that for this tutorial, we'll be using Filmora 11.

Step 1 Launch the Filmora app on your computer and create a new project.

Step 2 You can simply click the "Import media" button and load the video onto it.

Step 3 Hover over the video's thumbnail and click on the (+) button to add it to the timeline.

Step 4 Now, you need to play the video and find the section of the video where you need to add subtitles. Pause the video and add a mark by pressing the M key on your keyboard. You can also do the same by clicking the marker button, which is located beside the microphone icon in the top right of the timeline tab.

Step 5 To add the subtitle, you need to click on the "Titles" button that you can see at the top of the Filmora window. You can see several subtitle templates available there.

Step 6 Download, preview, and choose a subtitle template that seems most appropriate.

Step 7 You can then drag and drop the subtitle to the timeline above the video timeline. You can also trim the subtitle length from any side of the subtitle timeline box.

Step 8 You need to double-click on the subtitle timeline box to add custom text, change font size, color, and alignment, and add animations.

Step 9 Once done, you can click on the "Ok" button to save the changes.

Step 10 Similarly, you can add subtitles for different sections of the video.

## Conclusion

If you want to add custom subtitles to Netflix movies and TV shows, you can achieve the same with the two different methods mentioned above. For the first method to work, you must be a Netflix Premium user. On the other hand, the second method will work fine even if you aren't a Netflix Premium user.

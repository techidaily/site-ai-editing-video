## How To Quickly Create A Screen Print Effect In Photoshop: Detailed Guide

**Screen printing** is a unique method that uses a mesh to transfer ink onto a surface and is commonly used to print designs onto t-shirts or other garments, such as hoodies, tote bags, and even sneakers.

Nowadays, digital means such as Photoshop or Illustrator are used to create the screen print effect, which is achieved by using a layer mask to cut out a portion of the image and filling it with the color or pattern of your choice. The design is then printed onto fabric using water-based [CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel) (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) inks with inkjet printers.

Suppose you’ve ever wanted to create the screen print effect in Photoshop to give that artistic look to your pictures and embed them in your clothes or other accessories but don’t know where to start or are not familiar with the process. In that case, this guide can surely help you figure this out quickly!

So without any delay, let’s get on with it!

## How To Use Photoshop To Create The Print Effect

Below we’ve provided a detailed guide using Adobe Photoshop to create the print effect with easy step-by-step instructions.

### What Are The Requirements For Creating the Print Effect In PhotoShop?

Before we discuss the complete process of creating the print effect while using Photoshop, here are the resources you have to arrange.

* **Picture of the object:** We will cut out the object from the original image using the Lasso tool and unsaturate it. However, you have to ensure that the object is clear and easily detectable within the picture.
* **A background image:** You will need a background image to add the object to. For this, you can use a solid background, capture scenery, etc.
* **Fonts**: You can also add fonts to the final image to add your ideas or thoughts, making your final project more eye-catching and engaging.
* **Photoshop latest version:** For this tutorial, we will use the Photoshop CC 2021 version, so make sure to download and install it to your computer immediately!

### What Are The Steps To Create Print Effect in PhotoShop?

Now that you know the necessary resources, the following are the **steps to create the print effect in Photoshop**:

Step1 Launch the[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) program on your laptop/desktop and click **“Create New”** on the software dashboard. Next, select the page size, such as **“letter,”** and click **“Open.”**

![click create new](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/creating-new-document-in-photoshop-to-use-screen-print-effect.png)

Now, click the **“File”** option in the top toolbar, and from the drop-down menu, select **“Open.”** Next, choose the image you want to apply the screen print effect by browsing to its location on your computer.

To add the background image, click **"File"** and select **"Open."** Next, select the file and again click **"Open."**

Step5 Select the object using the **"Move Tool"** and drag it to the background image layer.

From the drop-down menu, choose **"Transform"** and click **"Scale."**

![select the object using the move tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adjusting-the-size-of-object-to-create-screen-print-effect-in-Photoshop.png)

Step6 Click the **“T”** icon from the left-hand side menu and set the font style, color, and size. You can also click the **“3D”** option to convert your text to a three-dimensional form.

![click t icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-text-to-the-canvas-in-photoshop.png)

Type in the file name and select the file type from the drop-down menu next to **“Save As Type.”** Choose the storage location, click **“Save”** to export your final project, and you’re done!

Step 1

Download and install the [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Just click the link, hit “**Download**”, and it will start automatically. Then, open a New Project.

Step 2

Click on the “**Titles**” tab and drag a Default Title to Track 2 on your Timeline.

![drag title in timeline filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/title.png)

Step 3

Double-click on it and change the font to anything you like. Then, enter the text in the box in front of you. While you’re here, you can also edit the text spacing and other features.

![edit title in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text.png)

Step 4

Now, take a snapshot of the text. Then, double-click on the default title again and change the text to a single letter I. Once again, take a snapshot of this text and then delete the default title from the timeline.

![take snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png)

You should have two snapshots in **My Media** now. One of them should say “FILMORA” and one with the letter “I”.

![media center in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/my-media.png)

Step 5

Drag the “FILMORA” snapshot to track 2 and the “I” snapshot to track 3\. Then, click on the “Zoom” button and set this to 50%.

![zoom option in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/zoom.png)

Step 6

Double-click on the “I” snapshot from the timeline. Then, input these settings when the window pops up. After that, drag the Playhead 1 second and 15 frames further down the timeline. Then, double-click on the “I” snapshot again, and change the Y-axis value to 0.

![animate text in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-animation.png)

Step 7

Copy the “I” snapshot track from the timeline. Then, paste it on Track 4\. Next, double-click on this one and change the X-axis position to whichever letter you want. In this case, it’s the letter “M”. As for the Y-Axis, you can change it any way that suits you.

![text animations in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/track-4.png)

Step 8

Copy this process as often and with as many letters as you want. Then, when you’re done, export the title animation to your computer.

![export project in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/export.png)

Step 9

Open a new project in Filmora and import the title animation we just created.

Step 10

Drag the custom title animation to Track 2 and drag any video background you have on Track 1.

![insert video background filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/background.png)

Step 11

Double-click on the title track, go to the Video tab, and select “**Lighten**” from the **Blending Mode** tab.

![blending mode lighten in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lighten.png)

Step 12

Shift the title clip from Track 2 to Track 3\. Then, go to the **Effects** tab and drag the **Dark Film** effect to Track 1 on the timeline.

![dark film effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dark-film.png)

Step 13

Search for the “Blur” effect in the Effects tab. Then, drag “**Square Blur**” to Track 2 in the timeline.

![blur effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/blur.png)

Step 14

Select the “**Cinema**” effect from the Effects tab and drag it to Track 4\. Double-click on it and change the border height to **0.10**.

![cinematic bar filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/cinema.png)

Step 15

Now, all left is to render the clip and review the final result.

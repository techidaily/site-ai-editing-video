To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.

![Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?

If this issue arises in your program, you'll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.

The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.

It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.

![Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?

If this issue arises in your program, you'll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.

The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.

It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.

* Start the program on your computer's operating system.

* Select Edit from the drop-down menu.

* Look towards preference

* Afterward, choose audio hardware.

* No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

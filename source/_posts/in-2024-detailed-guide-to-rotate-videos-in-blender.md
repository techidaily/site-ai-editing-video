## Detailed Guide to Rotate Videos in Blender

Blender is a 3D animation software that can be used to create stunning 3D models and videos. It is free and open source, which means that it is available to anyone who wants to use it. Blender is also very versatile, and can be used to create anything from simple 3D models to full-blown 3D movies.

One of the biggest benefits of Blender is that it is easy to learn. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, and there are plenty of tutorials available online that can help you get started. Blender also has a very active community, so if you ever get stuck, there is likely someone out there who can help you. It is a complex software, but there are many online tutorials like this article that can help you get started.

## Step-by-Step on how to rotate videos in Blender

The first way to rotate a video in Blender is by using the Strip option.

Step 1: To do this, open the video that you want to rotate in Blender.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-1.png)

Step 2: Then, click on the "Strip" menu and select "Transform."

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-2.png)

Step 3: In the Transform Properties window, you will see a list of different tools for the video. Scroll down until you see the "Rotation" property. This is where you can manually rotate the video.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-3.png)

Step 4: Click on Enter to save the rotation of the video.

The second way to rotate a video in Blender is by using the Transform Properties window. To do this...

Step 1: Open the video that you want to rotate in Blender.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-4.png)

Step 2: Next, go to ‘Transform’ in the Active Tool portion of the screen.

Step 3: Go to the ‘Transform’ option in the properties window and adjust based on the rotational angle that you want.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-6.png)

Step 4: Click on ‘Enter’ to apply it to the video.

In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.

Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.

Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.

Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:

\- Scale the video up or down

\- Flip the video horizontally or vertically

\- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport

There are two main ways to rotate video in Filmora: through the use of keyframes or by using the Transform Tool.

### Step-by-step on how to rotate videos in Filmora

To rotate a video clip using keyframes...

Step 1: Import the video clip you want to rotate to your project.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-7.png)

Step 2: In the timeline, place the playhead at the beginning of the clip.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-8.png)

Step 3: With the playhead still at the beginning of the clip, drag the rotation handle in the preview window to rotate the video.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-9.png)

Step 4: Move the playhead to the end of the clip and drag the rotation handle again to rotate it further.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-10.png)

To rotate a video clip using the Transform Tool...

Select the "Edit" tool from the toolbar.

## How to Create a Dynamic Text Animation in Filmora — Step-By-Step

Preparation

**What you need to prepare:**

* A computer (Windows or macOS)
* Your video materials.
* Filmora video editor

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Step 1

Download and install the [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Just click the link, hit “**Download**”, and it will start automatically. Then, open a New Project.

Step 2

Click on the “**Titles**” tab and drag a Default Title to Track 2 on your Timeline.

![drag title in timeline filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/title.png)

Step 3

Double-click on it and change the font to anything you like. Then, enter the text in the box in front of you. While you’re here, you can also edit the text spacing and other features.

![edit title in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text.png)

Step 4

Now, take a snapshot of the text. Then, double-click on the default title again and change the text to a single letter I. Once again, take a snapshot of this text and then delete the default title from the timeline.

![take snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png)

You should have two snapshots in **My Media** now. One of them should say “FILMORA” and one with the letter “I”.

![media center in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/my-media.png)

Step 5

Drag the “FILMORA” snapshot to track 2 and the “I” snapshot to track 3\. Then, click on the “Zoom” button and set this to 50%.

![zoom option in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/zoom.png)

Step 6

Double-click on the “I” snapshot from the timeline. Then, input these settings when the window pops up. After that, drag the Playhead 1 second and 15 frames further down the timeline. Then, double-click on the “I” snapshot again, and change the Y-axis value to 0.

![animate text in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-animation.png)

Step 7

Copy the “I” snapshot track from the timeline. Then, paste it on Track 4\. Next, double-click on this one and change the X-axis position to whichever letter you want. In this case, it’s the letter “M”. As for the Y-Axis, you can change it any way that suits you.

![text animations in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/track-4.png)

Step 8

Copy this process as often and with as many letters as you want. Then, when you’re done, export the title animation to your computer.

![export project in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/export.png)

Step 9

Open a new project in Filmora and import the title animation we just created.

Step 10

Drag the custom title animation to Track 2 and drag any video background you have on Track 1.

![insert video background filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/background.png)

Step 11

Double-click on the title track, go to the Video tab, and select “**Lighten**” from the **Blending Mode** tab.

![blending mode lighten in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lighten.png)

Step 12

Shift the title clip from Track 2 to Track 3\. Then, go to the **Effects** tab and drag the **Dark Film** effect to Track 1 on the timeline.

![dark film effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dark-film.png)

![blur effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/blur.png)

Step 14

Select the “**Cinema**” effect from the Effects tab and drag it to Track 4\. Double-click on it and change the border height to **0.10**.

![cinematic bar filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/cinema.png)

Step 15

Now, all left is to render the clip and review the final result.

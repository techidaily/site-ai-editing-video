## How to Create a Dynamic Text Animation in Filmora — Step-By-Step

Preparation

**What you need to prepare:**

* A computer (Windows or macOS)
* Your video materials.
* Filmora video editor

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Step 1

Download and install the [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Just click the link, hit “**Download**”, and it will start automatically. Then, open a New Project.

Step 2

Click on the “**Titles**” tab and drag a Default Title to Track 2 on your Timeline.

![drag title in timeline filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/title.png)

Step 3

Double-click on it and change the font to anything you like. Then, enter the text in the box in front of you. While you’re here, you can also edit the text spacing and other features.

![edit title in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text.png)

Step 4

Now, take a snapshot of the text. Then, double-click on the default title again and change the text to a single letter I. Once again, take a snapshot of this text and then delete the default title from the timeline.

![take snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png)

You should have two snapshots in **My Media** now. One of them should say “FILMORA” and one with the letter “I”.

![media center in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/my-media.png)

Step 5

Drag the “FILMORA” snapshot to track 2 and the “I” snapshot to track 3\. Then, click on the “Zoom” button and set this to 50%.

![zoom option in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/zoom.png)

Step 6

Double-click on the “I” snapshot from the timeline. Then, input these settings when the window pops up. After that, drag the Playhead 1 second and 15 frames further down the timeline. Then, double-click on the “I” snapshot again, and change the Y-axis value to 0.

![animate text in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-animation.png)

## Part 1 How to Use a GIF as Your Desktop Background on Windows?

Although Windows doesn't have native support to keep animated gif backgrounds, you can use third-party services to keep gifs as background images.

Using Plastuer or BioniX wallpaper changer as a 3rd party software is the best way to use animated gifs for your desktop.

As a starting point, we'll cover plastuer, which uses WebGL and chromium-browser to make gifs as your background.

![plastuer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/some-facts-about-gif-background-you-didnt-know-1.jpg)

The software includes selecting different screens where you want the wallpaper to appear, making it possible to apply it to different screens at once.

To select the gif you want:

**●** You can paste the URL of the gif you want to use.

**●** You can also use the "create playlist" field to add multiple gifs as your background.

**●** You can select a file from your device using the "select file" option.

**●** Or you can choose from hundreds of gifs present in the plastuer library.

**●** You can disable the wallpaper whenever you wish by clicking on the "disable wallpaper" option.

![plastuer 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/some-facts-about-gif-background-you-didnt-know-2.jpg)

**How to use the bioniX wallpaper changer?**

BioniX comes with several options that one may need to apply to their Windows device's background, and animated gif backgrounds are one of them.

![bionix wallpaper changer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/some-facts-about-gif-background-you-didnt-know-3.jpg)

You will need to download the software and once it is installed, launch it on your PC to apply cool gif backgrounds. To choose files from the device itself, you will have to use the shortcut command "CTRL+F", or you can also choose to insert the URL of the gif you want to use as your background.

Once your image gets uploaded into the software, double click on it to set it as your windows wallpaper. You can also choose a launch of gifs, create a playlist, and select the timer to change wallpaper regularly.

## Part 2 How to Make GIF Background on Windows/Mac/Android/iPhone?

So, how can you create moving background gifs on your different devices like Windows/Mac/Android/iPhone?

In case you thought that was hard, you were entirely mistaken. Now, you can easily create or customize cool background gifs for your computer, tablet, phone, or other devices that you own. The best part is that you don't need any technical skills to use different tools.

You can create gifs with the help of many tools such as Giphy and share them with your family, friends, and coworkers.

### 01Giphy

Giphy is a one-stop destination for all of your gifs needs. You can create or choose from thousands of gifs present in their library.

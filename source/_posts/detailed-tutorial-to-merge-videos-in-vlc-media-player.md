## Detailed Tutorial to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player

Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?

Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.

One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

## An Easier Way to Merge Videos in A Few Clicks

It's true that merging videos in VLC Media Player takes quite a few steps, so to speak. But is this the only editing program in which a similar operation can be performed? Of course not.

Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

## An Easier Way to Merge Videos in A Few Clicks

It's true that merging videos in VLC Media Player takes quite a few steps, so to speak. But is this the only editing program in which a similar operation can be performed? Of course not. Therefore, in our article, we decided to offer you an alternative, where you can also easily merge the videos. This is the famous [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , a software that is one of the easiest and most convenient to work with, especially for those who want to edit videos without having much experience in "complicated" software before.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-18.jpg)

* Accordingly, we can make one video "sit" next to another. If we want or need it, we will add the third video clip, fourth, and so on.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-19.jpg)

* We can view the entire video and save the video afterwards.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-20.jpg)

* In the opened window, on the left side, to be precise, if we observe well, we can already choose in which format we want to save our clip. On the right we can indicate what name we want to give to our video; The location where we want to store it; Also, we see the resolution (which we can modify freely after clicking on Settings); Size; Duration.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-21.jpg)

* In Settings, we can decide how much quality the video should have, how many kbps will be the Bit Rate, how many fps the Frame Rate should be, etc., but most likely, beginners will not need to change all this.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-22.jpg)

* After selecting everything, right-click on the Export button in the lower right corner of the window and the program will start saving the material.

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## Practical Way to Resize Video in Handbrake

Videos are a great medium to share thoughts, concepts, guides, and memories, but regardless of how far technology has come getting them online can pose an issue sometimes. These obstacles often tend to be because either a video clip is too long or the amount of data in it is so high that the service just cannot upload the file to its servers and make it available for the intended receiver.

To solve this issue, users often need to resize a video so that the data cap, which behaved as a restriction, is no longer applicable. Now, there exist multiple software that can do this, and most video editor programs include the ability to export videos in less data-hungry sizes or formats.

So, if you ever face a similar issue, here is a guide on how you can resize videos via Handbrake and Wondershare Filmora. The former is a lightweight tool perfect for batch resizing videos, while the latter is a powerful free video editing software.

## How to resize video with Handbrake

Open Handbrake and follow the steps listed below.

Once open, the software will present you with options to either import a single video file for resize or a whole batch via folder selection.

**_Note:_** _If you do not have Handbrake, you can_ [_download it by visiting the official website_](https://handbrake.fr/)_. Also, you will need_ [_Windows .NET Framework 6.0_](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime?utm%5Fsource=getdotnetcore&utm%5Fmedium=referral) _to use Handbrake._ _If your system does not have the correct config Handbrake will let you know and fail to launch._

Once you have imported the video file, the software will present you with two choices.

* **Option 1:** Use a preset available in the application — the best choice for beginners to choose for beginners.
* **Option 2:** Set a custom resolution via the Dimensions Tab.

**_Note:_** _To ensure the resize is perfect, find out which file format plays best with the end location of your video and convert the video clip to that version._

**Tip**

The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide

_Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution._

## An easier way to resize video with Wondershare Filmora

While the resize feature in Handbrake is capable of working on multiple video files at once, the user interface of the application may seem daunting to some. Hence, if you’re just starting to learn, we recommend accessing more user-friendly software, say Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . You can resize videos in the video editor by following the steps we have detailed below.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.

**Step 1:** Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-12.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.

**Author’s Notes:** Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg)

Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision

**Step 4:** Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg)

With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.

**Note:** You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the **Project Settings** option, found under the **File Tab**.

## The Bottom Line

Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.

## How To Film a Slow Motion Video

Scenes that might otherwise be monotonous can be made more interesting by the use of slow-motion photography in movies and television shows. For instance, a battle sequence between two characters can be portrayed in its entirety, but if it is later replayed in slow motion, the intensity of the action is amplified significantly.

Let’s dive in!

## 1\. What is slow motion?

Filmmakers use the slow-motion effect to create the illusion that the passage of time has been slowed down on the screen. In the early 20th century, an Austrian priest named August Musger was the one who came up with the idea. Playing normally recorded material at a slower pace is another method for creating the illusion of slow motion.

When a film is recorded at 25 frames per second, but played back at 24 frames per second, it will seem as if it is being shown in slow motion because all of the movements will be slightly slower than when they were actually performed. This is because the film was recorded at 25 frames per second, but the playback was done at 24 frames per second.

Because there are not enough frames to show all of the details of each frame when a 24-frame animation is played at a 25-frame rate (or a 30-frame animation at a 32-frame rate), certain frames have to be repeated (every 5th one in this case). When there is a dramatic event taking place, this manipulation of the film speed makes the action on screen appear even more dramatic or "tensioned."

![what is a slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-a-slow-motion-video.jpg)

## 2\. Understanding frame rates

When filming video, there are a set number of frames per second that you can choose from. One picture is all you get when you take a still photograph. Click. That is only one example. A frame is the name of that picture. With video, however, you take 30 or 24 images per second, which you then combine. You now have footage.

The video is a combination of tens of thousands of frames or images that are flashing before your eyes. With a normal frame rate of 24 frames per second, you are essentially taking 24 pictures per second and stitching them together to create video. When you stretch it out in post for slow motion, you double or triple the frame rate, which results in more images per second and eliminates empty gaps and jarring actions.

This is how video that has been sped up for slow motion may still preserve its quality. But you can't just choose a frame rate based on taste. Frame rates vary depending on the different types of emotions. 60 fps will do if the video is a slo-mo of a person's emotion. However, if your shot contains a lot of movement and you want to show it, such as when automobiles collide or explode, you may require a higher frame rate, such as 120 fps.

![understand frame rates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/understand-frame-rates.jpg)

## 3\. Post processing

This is when it gets a bit complicated. Some cameras come equipped with a slow-motion feature. To capture the video in slow motion at a higher frame rate, go to your settings. You might not have this built-in slow-motion feature in other models.

Therefore, even though the footage was taken at a higher frame rate, the camera is playing the movie back at the same pace it was shot at, so when you shoot at a higher frame rate, you end up with footage of a normal speed. There is a solution to that. The footage's speed can be adjusted during post-production.

The 24/30 fps editing timelines are pre-set. The majority of the video you capture at this frame rate plays back just nicely on this timeline. You must stretch out video that was shot at a higher frame rate to match this timeline, though. That effectively doubles or triples the length of a video, depending on the multiple of the timeline's typical frame rate.

## 4\. Lighting

While watching TV or movies, you might have observed anything. The majority of the extremely slow photos happen in broad daylight. Not after dark or in dimly lit areas. The reason for this is that sufficient lighting is required in order to capture motion. Lighting becomes crucial as your frame rate exceeds 300 frames per second. Therefore, if you must take these pictures, you must do so in a studio environment with lots of artificial lighting.

To create that cinematic magic, you can use high CRI lighting. On the screen, a flickering light may spell doom. Flickering lights have the potential to damage slow-motion film even though they would be OK for any other scene. Because there is no risk of voltage fluctuation, LED lights are a safe bet. The reason for this is that some models do not require an electrical outlet to function. Prior to departure, make sure you have checked each and every light.

If you are filming during the day and you point your camera toward the sun, you may end up with a significant amount of glare that cannot be hidden up in the post-production stage nor can it be ignored. This is not merely a problem that occurs throughout the daytime. Flares can also be obtained from moving vehicles and various other sources of light. If you use a flat lens when you're out at night, you can eliminate the risk of something like that happening.

![choose light for slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-light-for-slow-motion-video.jpg)

## 5\. Why use slow motion?

When you first begin working with slow-motion video, you need to ask yourself, "What exactly is the purpose behind me choosing this effect?" Once you have an answer to that question, you may move on to the next step.

**In most cases, there are often two primary causes for it.**

1\. It makes sense to present emotions on the screen for a longer period of time in order for the audience to be able to absorb and comprehend it in its whole if they are shown for a longer period of time since moments that are packed with emotions seem to endure longer than ordinary ones.

2\. The second strategy is to draw attention to striking visuals that you might have overlooked in other circumstances and that contribute significantly to the aesthetic value of your setting. A flutter of the eyelid, a butterfly stretching its wings, rains falling on a flower petal, shards of fire breaking free, etc. are all examples of how quickly things may happen. You need to have a good reason for using slow motion, and you shouldn't abuse the effect too much too. You should only do so at those moments where it makes logical sense to do so.

![draw attention with slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/draw-attention-with-slow-motion-video.jpg)

Subconscious slow-motion. Overusing or misusing a function ruins its appeal. Filming isn't an exact science, but it does nothing unnecessary. For a cinematic effect, slow-motion should be introduced carefully.

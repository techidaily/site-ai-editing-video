## Best Practical Tips to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun

Shooting outdoors is a challenge in most situations. We have to deal with the sun being overexposed or the background is too dark.

In this article, we'll show you how to light with the sun the easiest way. These simple and effective tips can help you block the harsh sun and make it to your advantage!

## 1) Preparation

You may need those things to film under the harsh sun:

1. An ND filter for your lens
2. A flag to block the sun. It can be anything like a black poster.
3. A white poster to bounce the sunlight.
4. Artificial light equipment.

Now let's see when and how to use them against the strong sunlight!

## 2) Direct to the Sun

If we want a specific background for our shot but our talent has to face the sun, here are some tips you can do to undermine the unflattering light or the blindness.

**1\. Pick up an ND filter on your lens**

![pick up an nd filter on lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/len.jpg)

We use it outside so we can open our aperture to get nice blurry backgrounds without overexposing our footage.

**2\. Use a "flag" to block or shape the sunlight**

![black flag](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/black-flag.jpg)

Using a black piece of poster board works perfectly fine, hold it up to the sun. Also, remember to angle your "flag" to create harsh lines or fully shade your talent.

**3\. Adjust your camera to fit the environment**

For example, you can change the exposure of your camera to match the talent's face giving a more silhouette look.

## 3) Back to the Sun

Have you ever been filming outside only to see your talent dark in the frame with the background blown out with light? To fix the problem, the simplest way is to use a "bounce".

By using a "bounce", we can reflect the light from the sun to our talent. Make sure to lift the bounce and move it around to get the right amount of light on your talent.

This should give us a nice look with the sun backlighting our subject and the bounce filling in the shadows and giving us soft light on our talent's face!

## 4) Artificial lighting

If we want to control our lighting better, we will want to use artificial lights in combination with the sun.

For example, weather changes. As you shot, the sun will move and make lighting challenging to keep consistent.

In that case, we can use the **flag technique** that we used before to block the harsh sunlight and then use our lights on our talent's face, this keeps our lighting more consistent than if we relied on just the natural light.

Now, take a look at the comparison with all the lighting conditions we create:

1. Flag VS Flag & Light

![flag vs flag light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/comparison-1.jpg)

1. Backlight VS Backlight & Bounce

![backlight vs backlight bounce](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/comparison-2.jpg)

## Summary

If you shoot or film outdoors, you must learn how to cope with the unsteady natural light. Hope this article helps you with that and kindly leave your thoughts below.

## Add Effects to Video Online

Recording a video is work half done. Editing the video is an equally important part. Apart from trimming out unnecessary parts and joining trimmed video clips, you have to add video effects to your video clips so that your video looks interesting. In fact, video effects are responsible for enhancing the beauty of the recorded video clips in the eyes of the viewers.

There is a wide range of video effects available to use on your videos, and turn them from ordinary video clips to stunning videos. The best part is that you do not have to install a video editor application on your device to apply video effects. This is because you can add effects to video online and that too for free of cost. We will discuss all the ways to add effects to your videos online that everyone can use conveniently.

1. [Way 1\. Use Veed.io Video Editor](#part2-1)
2. [Way 2\. Use Kapwing Video Editor](#part2-2)
3. [Way 3\. Use FlexClip Video Effects Editor](#part2-3)

## Part 1\. Popular Video Effects to Use Online

If you are wondering which effects to add to your videos to make them look extra-ordinary, here is the list of the popular video affects you can apply to your videos online.

Sparkle Effect – When you add sparkle effect to your video, you will see tiny flashes of lights like twinkling stars around the subject of the video or the entire frame of the video. There can also be stars shinning and glittering to enhance the glamour factor of the subject in your videos.

Snow Effect – When you add snow effect to video online, you get to see animated snowflakes falling across the video like snowfall in the winter. You need a proper scene to add snow effect, and it represents romantic and joyous mood in a video.

Speed Change Effect – Speed change effect is extremely common whereby you can slow down and fasten up the video playing speed as per your requirements. Slow-motion video is a part of speed change effect to emphasize a scene for a long period of time.

Reverb Effect – In this video effect, you see a particular scene reverberating, especially when the subject goes into imagining things and recalling memories. You can add reverb to video online when there is a jump cut scene in your video to smoothen the transition.

Transition Effect – Transition effect is a special type of video effects that you insert when you are making a transition from one scene to another. Transition effects smoothen the scene cuts for the eyes of the audience and refresh the mind to let them focus on the next scene.

Overlay Effect – Overlay effect is widely used in intro and outro of videos as well as to show titles and call to action options. Beautiful overlay effects can enhance the video content immensely and make it appear soothing to the eyes.

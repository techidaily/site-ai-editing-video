After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It's that simple!

#### 3\. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?

1. Apply your first LUT
2. Export the LUT
3. Access rendered movies
4. Apply the second LUT

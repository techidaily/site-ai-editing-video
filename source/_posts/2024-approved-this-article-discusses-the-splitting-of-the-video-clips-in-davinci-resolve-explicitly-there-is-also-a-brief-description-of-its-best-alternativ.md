## Unlink Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve [Detailed Steps]

There are various reasons why someone might want to remove audio from a video. Some of the film shots will have a lot of background noise, which might be distracting while watching the video. Some people like to include alternative audio or a soundtrack to make their films more presentable and attract people. So, whether you want to watch a silent video or one with a separate audio file, you'll have to erase the original audio.

## **How To Detach Audio and Video in Da Vinci Resolve**

DaVinci Resolve is a sound and video editing program for all types of files. It has numerous applications. Let's begin with audio extraction from a video clip below:

## **Wrapping Things Up**

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video. No matter how wonderful or perfect a video clip is, if the audio playing while watching it is terrible, it may be a very frustrating experience. So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

## **Wrapping Things Up**

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

1. Navigate to the "Edit" page.

3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."

Also, you need to adjust the position and duration of the title to get a better view. In the intro video, it is recommended to add your logo or slogan as well. To add your logo, drag and drop it to the track above the video, and adjust its position and size.

##### Step5Add Effects to your Intro Video

Go to ‘EFFECTS’ tab, choose a category from the top-left pane, and click and drag your preferred effect from the Effects library to the timeline. Adjust the playback duration by dragging the right handle of the track in the timeline as explained above. Optionally, double-click the Effects track to customize the appearance as needed.

##### Step2Add Color Templates

After installing, wait until the installation is finished. Launch Wondershare Filmora and go to MEDIA tab at the top left of the interface and select the best suitable background color for your intro video from the dropdown menu in the MEDIA tab. Drag your cursor over the tile of the color you wish to use as a background and click to add the icon that appears in the center to add it to the timeline.

![media for use 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/media-for-use-01.png)

Additionally, if you don’t prefer the preset backgrounds and colors, Filmora lets you use your own background image or video clip. For this, select PROJECT MEDIA > click anywhere inside the media window > import media file of your choice. After importing the file, click on the imported file to add it to the timeline.

##### Step3Select and add audio effect to your Intro Video

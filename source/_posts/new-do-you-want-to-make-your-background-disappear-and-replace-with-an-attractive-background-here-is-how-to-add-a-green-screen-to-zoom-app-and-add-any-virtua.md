## Part 3\. Tips to use green screen on Zoom video

Here are some important tips to use green screen on Zoom video for a better outcome.

Buy Large Green Screen - Since you are going to invest in buying green screen, you should buy a large green screen instead of buying two. Firstly, when you have one large green screen, you can set it up without any wrinkles or overlaps.

Secondly, a large green screen means greater surface area, and even when you slightly change the angle of your camera, your background will still have green screen instead of the exterior wall showing up and ruining virtual background effect.

Buy Green Screen Stand - Along with green screen, you should buy a sizeable green screen stand. A regular green screen stand contains two vertical supports at both ends and one horizontal support where you hand the green screen.

You can buy it according to the size of green screen you have bought. And you need to buy stand because you cannot fix the green screen on the wall properly. If you use any other means, there are going to be wrinkles and uneven virtual background effect.

Green Screen Quality - You can purchase any shade of green screen, but we recommend you opt for vibrant green color for a better outcome. Most importantly, the color should be even across the surface, and there should not be light and dark patches to dampen the virtual background effect and make it look unrealistic. That is why you should not compromise with quality.

Avoid Green Objects - You should not wear anything green. If your green screen has a lighter shade, you can wear deep color dresses and vice versa. Most importantly, you should not keep anything that is green while attending Zoom attending as it will disturb the green screen effect and it will look embarrassing. If you need to keep any green objects in your Zoom meetings, you should have blue screen instead of green screen.

Focus On Lighting - Lighting is extremely important when you want to use green screen. You should place the light so that it spreads evenly across the green screen. Otherwise, there are going to be light and dark patches, and the effect can get disturbed. Make sure you do not cast any shadow on the green screen by positioning the green screen accordingly.

Select A Proper Background - Last but not least, when you change your green screen to any virtual background photo or video, make sure you keep your audiences in mind. If you are attending a meeting, you should keep a professional-looking background. The background should not be distracting and match the theme of your meeting.

## Conclusion

We have answered your question, “How do you add a green screen to zoom?” You can use green screen on your Zoom desktop app as well as smartphone app. This will help you to make your usual background cover up with green screen and replace green screen with any virtual background. Keep in mind all the tips we have provided you so that the green screen effect is perfect.

### **Numerous Video Effects**

Importing media and editing it on the timeline to create a compelling tale is the first step in a video editor's post-production process. Following those foundational steps, an editor applies various effects to the video in order to fix issues, improve mood, intensify suspense, and add magic to the video. Filmora offers a great variety of customizable filters, effects, transitions and the best part? You don’t even have to be a pro to use these effects.

### **Title Editing**

Filmora enables the intro video makers to adorn the titles of their videos by selecting among multiple text editing options. Both short videos and full-length movies must have opening titles and closing credits. You may catch the audience's attention from the first frame of your video by coming up with inventive methods to employ text which precisely conveys the tale of your film. You may utilize more than a hundred text settings in Filmora's Titles tab to add text to the video.

### **Text to Speech/STT**

Speaking in your videos may increase engagement and make it simpler for viewers to grasp what you're saying. But how can you add audio without first recording it? Are you considering hiring a voice actor? Don’t worry! Filmora got your back by offering Text to Speech (TTS) function, which enables the users to add voice to your video. Filmora automatically transcripts your text files into speech on the click of a button.

### **Audio Editing**

Filmora additionally offers an audio panel where the software helps to manipulate audio added to your intro videos. The audio editing feature of Filmora enables users to improve the quality of the audio, to remove unwanted noises, balance pitch or change the length of a particular audio file.

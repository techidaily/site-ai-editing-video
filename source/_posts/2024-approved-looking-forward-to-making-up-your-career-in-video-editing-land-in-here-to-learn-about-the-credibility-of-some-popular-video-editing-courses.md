## This Article Introduces How Sheila Become a Youtuber and How She Started Video Editing

I'm Sheila and I'm a Youtuber for five years in a row. I'm editing my vlogs using my cellphone only, not until I found this Wondershare Filmora for Personal Computers. Not like any other video editor that you need to crack your brain understanding each and every feature, this video editor that I'm talking about on the other hand, made it simple and very handy to use.

![Why I Become a Youtuber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-06.jpg)

Why I Become a Youtuber

## 1\. How I Decided to Start from Uploading the Video

But before we move forward for more details about the video editor itself, let's get back first five years ago. It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.

![Uploading the Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-07.jpg)

Uploading the Video

## 2\. The Necessary Things a Vlog Should Have

* A teaser – wherein your aim is to caught the attention of your viewers.
* An intro – what is your channel all about.
* The body of the vlog – the part wherein you're explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called **"**call of action**"** \- wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you're tackling. And last is the
* Outro – closing session of your vlog.

![Vlog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-08.jpg)

Vlog

## 3\. What Have I Encountered on the Way

As the saying goes by, **"**The beginning is always the hardest part**"** and really it was. My YouTube journey was not as easy that even my friends didn't recognize my endeavors. But still, I continue what I'm doing because I love it. It's a hobby that at the same time, I'm learning something new on the process. And also, with the help of vlogging, I'm starting to gain my self-esteem that I forgot for many years back.

![What Have I Encountered on the Way](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-09.jpg)

What Have I Encountered on the Way

It's not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you've got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who's going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who's in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who'll edit the video afterwards.

On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn't mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it's quality over quantity. You'll have to think what kind of video you'll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.

If you're a new YouTuber, you don't need to have high-end equipment's for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his/her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6\. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.

## 4\. What to Do As a YouTuber

As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you're passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you're a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.

![What to Do As a YouTuber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-10.jpg)

What to Do As a YouTuber

As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you'll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you'll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.

It's okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor's timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, **"**dead air**"** or the part that you're starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you're doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.

## 5\. How I Started Video Editing

As I've told you at the start of this article, I'm a phone editor not until I found **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

## What Is VHS?

Since its introduction in 1976, VHS has been the most frequently used video cassette recording technology. The VHS format is a consumer-level analog video cassette recording standard for videotaping. The acronym VHS referred to Vertical Helical Scan and was eventually modified as the popularity of this technology increased.

Produced by a Japan Victor Company, the technology uses a magnetic tape measuring half an inch. By the 1950s, magnetic tape video recording had become a vital part of the television industry. The technology is exclusively utilized in professional settings like TV studios and medical imaging (fluoroscopy).

As consumer access to videotape increased in the 1970s, a new economy centered on home video emerged, drastically altering the economics of the film and television industries. By 1980, VHS had captured 70% of the market and had established itself as the industry standard for entertainment and instruction.

The original standard has a picture quality equivalent to that of analog television. High-definition television content could be recorded and re-created using digital VHS (D-VHS). Progressively, a new format was launched dubbed S-VHS (Super VHS), which featured improved video quality from 240 to 400 lines; however, people did not use it extensively.

VHS tape, compared to its competition at the time, Betamax tapes had longer tape lifespans. VHS tapes were preferred because they recorded three times as long as Betamax tapes because of their higher storage capacity.

The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.

The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.

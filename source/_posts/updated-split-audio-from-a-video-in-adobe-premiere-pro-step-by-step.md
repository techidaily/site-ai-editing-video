Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

#### In this article

01 [What Is Color Distortion](#part1)

02 [How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?](#part2)

03 [Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos](#part3)

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

### Method 1: Correct Color Distortion in Videos Using Filmora

Filmora is user-friendly software with powerful tools that allow users to tweak the color settings and correct color distortion. Follow the steps below to learn how to correct color distortion in videos using Filmora.

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## How to Make Audio Visualizer in Filmora [Easy]

While editing videos, the ability to edit the audio in the background is one of the key ingredients of successful video making. For this purpose, the Audio Visualizer as a resource on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a high-quality option. With this feature, users can typically add audio effects to their video soundtrack with AI technology, aligning the sound properly with the video.

It is possible to choose out of 25 different effects for audio visualization on this software for customized audio effects. You can also drag visual-based effects to the file, which the software mechanism will automatically configure with the sound cohesively.

While this is useful as a functionality, users naturally have concerns about how to handle the Audio Visualization effect to work on video projects and podcasts. Let's learn the main steps for this process in this post, explained stage by stage in detail.

## Launch the App

The first step is downloading and installing the software into your device. For this, go to the official website of Wondershare Filmora 11 and click on the Free Download button at the top of the screen. Depending on your device's operating system, i.e., macOS or Windows, the relevant software installer will download automatically into your device.

Next, you should go to the Effects tab. When this window opens, you should tap on the Filmstock tab beside the Default one for advanced features like Audio Visualizer. Click on it next.

When you tap on it, you see a list of different visualizer effects in a collection. Please choose one of them that you prefer and download it.

![tap on the filmstock tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-6.jpg)

After that, you must drag the visualizer effect selected from the collection to the editing timeline above the background image you added previously. Again, use the slider on the clip to drag it forward and fit the size of both the music clip and the image.

## Edit the Audio Visualiser

The next step of the process that you must focus on is editing the audio visualizer properly for the song and its background cover. For this, you must double-click on the audio visualizer effect you dropped in the timeline- this will open the editing window for the clip.

Here, make some changes to the quality of the audio visualizer as you prefer. Adjustment options available here include position, scale, Opacity, and Intensity. Drag the sliders for them to adjust the visualizer effect as needed. Change the color of the visualizer as well from here, and then use the slider on the visualizer effect on the timeline to see the effect change. Press the OK button after you are done.

![make changes to the quality of the audio visualizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-7.jpg)

## Add the Portrait Image

Go to the My Media tab next to get the Portrait image into the project. If you previously imported the image to Filmora, drag it to the timeline. Or, you can add it later by clicking on the Import Media button and adding the Portrait photo from your device.

When it is available on the media window, hold, drag, and then drop it above the visualizer. Like in the case of the previous parts, use the slider end of this image in the timeline to drag it and fit the size of the other clips.

![adding the portrait image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-8.jpg)

Next, the editing window for that will open. Make changes to the size and placement of the portrait photo, with elements like scale, position, rotation, opacity, etc. Move the photo in the preview window to the section where you want the image to appear. Then, tap the OK button under the window.

![tap the ok button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-9.jpg)

## Add the overlapping visualizer effect

After adding the portrait, you can add another audio visualizer effect to the project. For this, again, tap on the Effects tab and choose the Filmstock option. Select Audio Visualizer and click on the circular visualizer effect from the list. Repeat the dragging and dropping step for this effect as well.

On the timeline, you have to adjust the visualizer effect over the portrait photo to match the length of the previous clips. Then, please tap on the portrait photo in the timeline again and adjust its appearance, like reducing the image size to fit the second visualizer effect size.

![reduce size of image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-10.jpg)

After fitting the image within the visualizer, click on the Mask tab in the same editor window. Choose the circular shape preset and scroll down to find the adjustment parameters like position, scaling, horizontal/vertical lining, etc. Keep making the changes per your needs, like fitting the image to the same size as the circular visualizer.

Move it to place the image inside the visualizer. After you are done, press the OK button.

## Add a Title

An attractive title is the next element you should add to the project. You have to click on the Titles tab from the top toolbar. Choose the titles option from the drop-down list and move it to the timeline below. As you did with the previous elements you added to the timeline, move the slider onward and fit it with the previous one's length.

Next, you should click on the Title in the timeline you added for the Title editing window to open. Here, you have to tap on the Advanced button.

![tap on the advanced button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-11.jpg)

In the next window that opens, tap on the Customize tab and add the song name in the title area. Make other font-related changes as you see fit, like the font size, font style, indentation, color, etc. Tap on the add text icon in this window to get another text field in which you can add the artist's name. Make sure to reduce the size of it to lower than that of the main song title text.

![tap on the add text icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-12.jpg)

Following that, you can tap on the shape icon to add a shape to the project by adding the name of the streaming service provider, like Apple Music or Spotify. Choose the Rectangle option, for example, and move it to the side of the screen. Click on the shape editing option and adjust the border size of it to three.

If you want to create a rounded-off edge look to the rectangle shape, tap on the small yellow icon that you will see at its edge. Move it slightly to adjust. Then, type the information into the shape text field, like "Listen on Spotify," and make font and shape size adjustments. After you have completed this step, press the OK button below.

## Check and Export

After making the changes, you will return to the main editor timeline. Press the play button under the preview window to see how the final project looks, and tap on the Export button to download it offline. Make changes to the exporting file after clicking on the Local tab and choosing the file format you will download it as. Then, press Export again.

![press the play button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-13.jpg)

## Conclusion

Indeed, Filmora is a high-quality editing software for video editors with effects and sound clips to optimize the project. Advanced functions like the Audio Visualizer system are available for high-quality project optimization since it instantly handles most of the heavy editing load.

You should follow the sequence mentioned accurately to make the right effects at the end. Plus, more editing features are available, so creating an interesting video project or podcast that attracts audiences is easy. So go ahead and give it a try first.

## Take Your Video Editing to the Next Level with Video Scopes

All video editors have been there. You edit and color-correct your video project only to find out that the final product is not what you expected. The contract and colors dramatically shift when viewed on a different device. In most cases, this is caused by improperly calibrated monitors, but it could also be your eyes playing tricks on you. **Video scopes** help in preventing this problem ensuring that the color in your video is consistent across devices. With video editing scope, you get the exact representation of the elements that make up your image, including lightness and color values. In this article, we explain what video scopes are and how you can use them in your editing projects.

## **Part 1\. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them**

When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.

![video scopes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-1.JPG)

Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:

* **Increased Accuracy**: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments
* **Reliability**: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.
* **Professional Editing**: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.
* **Matching Color Between Shots**: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.

Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.

## **Part 2\. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones**

Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:

* [Waveform Scopes](#scope1)
* [Histogram](#scope2)
* [RGB Parade](#scope3)
* [Vector Scopes](#scope4)

### **1\. Waveform Scopes**

Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-2.JPG)

### **2\. Histogram**

The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0\. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-3.JPG)

### **3\. RGB Parade**

This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.

![rgb parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-4.JPG)

### **4\. Vector Scopes**

This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.

The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0\. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-3.JPG)

### **3\. RGB Parade**

This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.

![rgb parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-4.JPG)

### **4\. Vector Scopes**

This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.

## Part 1: Video Editing Basics

Before going to the best video editors, you should be aware of the basics of video editing. Here are the basic concepts of video editing that you must know as they are common across all video editors.

1\. The Timeline: The timeline is an area of a video editor where you place your video clips sequentially. When you play the video after editing, the video will play from the start of the timeline and finish at the end of the timeline where your video content ends. The timeline is where you can place your audio clips, video effects, and graphical elements as per your requirements.

2\. The Canvas: The canvas is an area of a video editor where you view your video clips frame by frame. The canvas allows you to edit the video starting from cropping to adding graphical elements. You can view all the changes you make to the video before applying them permanently.

3\. Basic editing: The basic editing of a video includes splitting and trimming out important parts of a large video file and, thereafter, joining the different video clips to make an engaging video. The basic editing also includes adding audio clips, adjusting video parameters such as color, brightness, contrast as well as adding texts to the video.

4\. Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio of a video represents the ratio of width to height of the video in terms of pixels. For example, a video with aspect ratio of 16:9 means the video is 1920p x 1080p. You can edit the aspect ratio depending on where you want to publish the video. For example, social media videos use 1:1 and 9: 16 aspect ratio, tablets use 4:3 aspect ratio, and 16:9 is the standard aspect ratio.

5\. B-roll: B-roll is a secondary video footage that you can add to your primary video(A-roll) to enhance the video creativity and aesthetic value. B-roll could be a cinematic shot, a slow-motion footage, a close-up shot from different angles, as well as a shot mixed with wide-angle, pans, and tilts.

6\. Frame Rate: Frame rate refers to the number of images or frames displayed per second in a video. In short, frame rate refers to frames per second in a video. For example, a video of 30fps means the video is showing 30 different images per second. The 24fps is used for movies and the 30fps is used for online and TV videos. Even 60fps videos are becoming common as they produce a smoother video experience.

## Part 6: How to Choose the Suitable Video Editor?

The most important part of video editing is to choose the most suitable video editor for your videos. Here are some important factors to consider while choosing a video editor.

1\. Budget and Price: If you are getting started, you can opt for a free video editor. But eventually, you have to go for a premium video editor if you are serious about video editing. You should opt for that video editor that fits your budget and offers more features for the price charged in comparison to its competitors.

2\. Learning Curve: You should always opt for a video editor that has a low learning curve. If the video editor is complicated to operate, you will get frustrated, and you won't be able to unlock the full potential of the video editor. Besides, you will have to lose a lot of time in learning and perfecting the usage of the application.

3\. Stock Library: The video editor you are choosing must have a sizeable stock media library. A stock library is where you can find video clips and audio clips that are free to use for everyone. You can incorporate them into your video to enhance the content quality and bring variety to your audiences.

4\. Audio control: Video editing is incomplete without proper audio editing. Your video editor should have a separate timeline for audio clips so that you can place them perfect to go in sync with the video clips. Some video editors have dedicated options for audio mixing and editing as per requirements.

5\. upport video formats: Your video editor must support a wide range of video file formats that you have to include from time to time. If it supports only the popular file formats, you will not be able to include the interesting videos you may get from different sources which the video editor does not support.

6\. Software stability: If you need to edit high-resolution videos, you have to ensure that the video editor you are choosing can stay stable throughout. There are many popular video editors available that become unstable while editing and rendering high-resolution videos. You have to read reviews to come to a conclusion about software stability.

7\. Customer Support: Last but most importantly, your video editor must have a good customer support team. In your video editing journey, you will need the help of technical customer support to clarify issues related to the software so that you can excel in your video editing sessions.

## Part 7: Video Editing Tips for Beginners

Here are some basic video editing tips that you should keep in mind while editing any video.

1\. Try Tight Cuts: Your video should not be too long so that it gets boring for the viewers. Therefore, you have to make tight cuts which means you have to cut out pauses, gaps between dialogs, and anything that is unnecessary for viewers. If you think that tight cuts will take more time than usual, you can consider reshooting the part to save time.

2\. Put The Story Before The Footage: When you are shooting a planned video, you must be shooting the video with multiple cameras from different angles. While editing and choosing the perfect angle for a certain video segment, you have to select the one that enhances the story you are telling through your video. For example, in an interview video, you should know when to emphasize and show close angles to capture the emotion of the speaker.

3\. Chop Out Mistakes: The most basic work in video editing is to cut out the mistakes. This is because you are sure to make mistakes while shooting, and you will reshoot a lot of mistakes to correct them. Therefore, take your time to chop out mistakes but make sure that the video feels continuous, and if required, you can reshoot. To avoid mistakes in action, you can use different camera angles, blur portions, and bleep out certain words.

4\. Learn to use color: Color correction and adjustment is a majorly neglected part of video editing that can make your video different from others. When you are shooting in outdoor conditions, the color of the video could get disturbed depending on the color of your dress as well as your surrounding. While editing, you need to correct them so that the video looks visually pleasing to the eyes.

5\. Cut to music: Audio plays a very important role in any video, and hence, you should not neglect it. Always opt for a video editor that has a good collection of stock music so that you can apply them to your video in appropriate places. Music helps to break the monotony and grab the attention of the audience instantly.

6\. Back up your work: It takes hours to shoot a video but only a second to lose it. Instead of blindingly relying on your storage device, you should take back up of your work on multiple devices. Taking backup in the cloud storage area is the best option as you can access your work from anywhere.

## Part 1: Video Editing Basics

Before going to the best video editors, you should be aware of the basics of video editing. Here are the basic concepts of video editing that you must know as they are common across all video editors.

1\. The Timeline: The timeline is an area of a video editor where you place your video clips sequentially. When you play the video after editing, the video will play from the start of the timeline and finish at the end of the timeline where your video content ends. The timeline is where you can place your audio clips, video effects, and graphical elements as per your requirements.

2\. The Canvas: The canvas is an area of a video editor where you view your video clips frame by frame. The canvas allows you to edit the video starting from cropping to adding graphical elements. You can view all the changes you make to the video before applying them permanently.

3\. Basic editing: The basic editing of a video includes splitting and trimming out important parts of a large video file and, thereafter, joining the different video clips to make an engaging video. The basic editing also includes adding audio clips, adjusting video parameters such as color, brightness, contrast as well as adding texts to the video.

4\. Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio of a video represents the ratio of width to height of the video in terms of pixels. For example, a video with aspect ratio of 16:9 means the video is 1920p x 1080p. You can edit the aspect ratio depending on where you want to publish the video. For example, social media videos use 1:1 and 9: 16 aspect ratio, tablets use 4:3 aspect ratio, and 16:9 is the standard aspect ratio.

5\. B-roll: B-roll is a secondary video footage that you can add to your primary video(A-roll) to enhance the video creativity and aesthetic value. B-roll could be a cinematic shot, a slow-motion footage, a close-up shot from different angles, as well as a shot mixed with wide-angle, pans, and tilts.

6\. Frame Rate: Frame rate refers to the number of images or frames displayed per second in a video. In short, frame rate refers to frames per second in a video. For example, a video of 30fps means the video is showing 30 different images per second. The 24fps is used for movies and the 30fps is used for online and TV videos. Even 60fps videos are becoming common as they produce a smoother video experience.

## Part 6: How to Choose the Suitable Video Editor?

The most important part of video editing is to choose the most suitable video editor for your videos. Here are some important factors to consider while choosing a video editor.

1\. Budget and Price: If you are getting started, you can opt for a free video editor. But eventually, you have to go for a premium video editor if you are serious about video editing. You should opt for that video editor that fits your budget and offers more features for the price charged in comparison to its competitors.

2\. Learning Curve: You should always opt for a video editor that has a low learning curve. If the video editor is complicated to operate, you will get frustrated, and you won't be able to unlock the full potential of the video editor. Besides, you will have to lose a lot of time in learning and perfecting the usage of the application.

3\. Stock Library: The video editor you are choosing must have a sizeable stock media library. A stock library is where you can find video clips and audio clips that are free to use for everyone. You can incorporate them into your video to enhance the content quality and bring variety to your audiences.

4\. Audio control: Video editing is incomplete without proper audio editing. Your video editor should have a separate timeline for audio clips so that you can place them perfect to go in sync with the video clips. Some video editors have dedicated options for audio mixing and editing as per requirements.

5\. upport video formats: Your video editor must support a wide range of video file formats that you have to include from time to time. If it supports only the popular file formats, you will not be able to include the interesting videos you may get from different sources which the video editor does not support.

6\. Software stability: If you need to edit high-resolution videos, you have to ensure that the video editor you are choosing can stay stable throughout. There are many popular video editors available that become unstable while editing and rendering high-resolution videos. You have to read reviews to come to a conclusion about software stability.

7\. Customer Support: Last but most importantly, your video editor must have a good customer support team. In your video editing journey, you will need the help of technical customer support to clarify issues related to the software so that you can excel in your video editing sessions.

## Part 7: Video Editing Tips for Beginners

Here are some basic video editing tips that you should keep in mind while editing any video.

1\. Try Tight Cuts: Your video should not be too long so that it gets boring for the viewers. Therefore, you have to make tight cuts which means you have to cut out pauses, gaps between dialogs, and anything that is unnecessary for viewers. If you think that tight cuts will take more time than usual, you can consider reshooting the part to save time.

2\. Put The Story Before The Footage: When you are shooting a planned video, you must be shooting the video with multiple cameras from different angles. While editing and choosing the perfect angle for a certain video segment, you have to select the one that enhances the story you are telling through your video. For example, in an interview video, you should know when to emphasize and show close angles to capture the emotion of the speaker.

3\. Chop Out Mistakes: The most basic work in video editing is to cut out the mistakes. This is because you are sure to make mistakes while shooting, and you will reshoot a lot of mistakes to correct them. Therefore, take your time to chop out mistakes but make sure that the video feels continuous, and if required, you can reshoot. To avoid mistakes in action, you can use different camera angles, blur portions, and bleep out certain words.

4\. Learn to use color: Color correction and adjustment is a majorly neglected part of video editing that can make your video different from others. When you are shooting in outdoor conditions, the color of the video could get disturbed depending on the color of your dress as well as your surrounding. While editing, you need to correct them so that the video looks visually pleasing to the eyes.

5\. Cut to music: Audio plays a very important role in any video, and hence, you should not neglect it. Always opt for a video editor that has a good collection of stock music so that you can apply them to your video in appropriate places. Music helps to break the monotony and grab the attention of the audience instantly.

6\. Back up your work: It takes hours to shoot a video but only a second to lose it. Instead of blindingly relying on your storage device, you should take back up of your work on multiple devices. Taking backup in the cloud storage area is the best option as you can access your work from anywhere.

## Part 1: Video Editing Basics

Before going to the best video editors, you should be aware of the basics of video editing. Here are the basic concepts of video editing that you must know as they are common across all video editors.

1\. The Timeline: The timeline is an area of a video editor where you place your video clips sequentially. When you play the video after editing, the video will play from the start of the timeline and finish at the end of the timeline where your video content ends. The timeline is where you can place your audio clips, video effects, and graphical elements as per your requirements.

2\. The Canvas: The canvas is an area of a video editor where you view your video clips frame by frame. The canvas allows you to edit the video starting from cropping to adding graphical elements. You can view all the changes you make to the video before applying them permanently.

3\. Basic editing: The basic editing of a video includes splitting and trimming out important parts of a large video file and, thereafter, joining the different video clips to make an engaging video. The basic editing also includes adding audio clips, adjusting video parameters such as color, brightness, contrast as well as adding texts to the video.

4\. Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio of a video represents the ratio of width to height of the video in terms of pixels. For example, a video with aspect ratio of 16:9 means the video is 1920p x 1080p. You can edit the aspect ratio depending on where you want to publish the video. For example, social media videos use 1:1 and 9: 16 aspect ratio, tablets use 4:3 aspect ratio, and 16:9 is the standard aspect ratio.

5\. B-roll: B-roll is a secondary video footage that you can add to your primary video(A-roll) to enhance the video creativity and aesthetic value. B-roll could be a cinematic shot, a slow-motion footage, a close-up shot from different angles, as well as a shot mixed with wide-angle, pans, and tilts.

6\. Frame Rate: Frame rate refers to the number of images or frames displayed per second in a video. In short, frame rate refers to frames per second in a video. For example, a video of 30fps means the video is showing 30 different images per second. The 24fps is used for movies and the 30fps is used for online and TV videos. Even 60fps videos are becoming common as they produce a smoother video experience.

## Part 6: How to Choose the Suitable Video Editor?

The most important part of video editing is to choose the most suitable video editor for your videos. Here are some important factors to consider while choosing a video editor.

1\. Budget and Price: If you are getting started, you can opt for a free video editor. But eventually, you have to go for a premium video editor if you are serious about video editing. You should opt for that video editor that fits your budget and offers more features for the price charged in comparison to its competitors.

2\. Learning Curve: You should always opt for a video editor that has a low learning curve. If the video editor is complicated to operate, you will get frustrated, and you won't be able to unlock the full potential of the video editor. Besides, you will have to lose a lot of time in learning and perfecting the usage of the application.

3\. Stock Library: The video editor you are choosing must have a sizeable stock media library. A stock library is where you can find video clips and audio clips that are free to use for everyone. You can incorporate them into your video to enhance the content quality and bring variety to your audiences.

4\. Audio control: Video editing is incomplete without proper audio editing. Your video editor should have a separate timeline for audio clips so that you can place them perfect to go in sync with the video clips. Some video editors have dedicated options for audio mixing and editing as per requirements.

5\. upport video formats: Your video editor must support a wide range of video file formats that you have to include from time to time. If it supports only the popular file formats, you will not be able to include the interesting videos you may get from different sources which the video editor does not support.

6\. Software stability: If you need to edit high-resolution videos, you have to ensure that the video editor you are choosing can stay stable throughout. There are many popular video editors available that become unstable while editing and rendering high-resolution videos. You have to read reviews to come to a conclusion about software stability.

7\. Customer Support: Last but most importantly, your video editor must have a good customer support team. In your video editing journey, you will need the help of technical customer support to clarify issues related to the software so that you can excel in your video editing sessions.

## Part 7: Video Editing Tips for Beginners

Here are some basic video editing tips that you should keep in mind while editing any video.

1\. Try Tight Cuts: Your video should not be too long so that it gets boring for the viewers. Therefore, you have to make tight cuts which means you have to cut out pauses, gaps between dialogs, and anything that is unnecessary for viewers. If you think that tight cuts will take more time than usual, you can consider reshooting the part to save time.

2\. Put The Story Before The Footage: When you are shooting a planned video, you must be shooting the video with multiple cameras from different angles. While editing and choosing the perfect angle for a certain video segment, you have to select the one that enhances the story you are telling through your video. For example, in an interview video, you should know when to emphasize and show close angles to capture the emotion of the speaker.

3\. Chop Out Mistakes: The most basic work in video editing is to cut out the mistakes. This is because you are sure to make mistakes while shooting, and you will reshoot a lot of mistakes to correct them. Therefore, take your time to chop out mistakes but make sure that the video feels continuous, and if required, you can reshoot. To avoid mistakes in action, you can use different camera angles, blur portions, and bleep out certain words.

4\. Learn to use color: Color correction and adjustment is a majorly neglected part of video editing that can make your video different from others. When you are shooting in outdoor conditions, the color of the video could get disturbed depending on the color of your dress as well as your surrounding. While editing, you need to correct them so that the video looks visually pleasing to the eyes.

5\. Cut to music: Audio plays a very important role in any video, and hence, you should not neglect it. Always opt for a video editor that has a good collection of stock music so that you can apply them to your video in appropriate places. Music helps to break the monotony and grab the attention of the audience instantly.

6\. Back up your work: It takes hours to shoot a video but only a second to lose it. Instead of blindingly relying on your storage device, you should take back up of your work on multiple devices. Taking backup in the cloud storage area is the best option as you can access your work from anywhere.

## Part 1: Video Editing Basics

Before going to the best video editors, you should be aware of the basics of video editing. Here are the basic concepts of video editing that you must know as they are common across all video editors.

1\. The Timeline: The timeline is an area of a video editor where you place your video clips sequentially. When you play the video after editing, the video will play from the start of the timeline and finish at the end of the timeline where your video content ends. The timeline is where you can place your audio clips, video effects, and graphical elements as per your requirements.

2\. The Canvas: The canvas is an area of a video editor where you view your video clips frame by frame. The canvas allows you to edit the video starting from cropping to adding graphical elements. You can view all the changes you make to the video before applying them permanently.

3\. Basic editing: The basic editing of a video includes splitting and trimming out important parts of a large video file and, thereafter, joining the different video clips to make an engaging video. The basic editing also includes adding audio clips, adjusting video parameters such as color, brightness, contrast as well as adding texts to the video.

4\. Aspect Ratio: The aspect ratio of a video represents the ratio of width to height of the video in terms of pixels. For example, a video with aspect ratio of 16:9 means the video is 1920p x 1080p. You can edit the aspect ratio depending on where you want to publish the video. For example, social media videos use 1:1 and 9: 16 aspect ratio, tablets use 4:3 aspect ratio, and 16:9 is the standard aspect ratio.

5\. B-roll: B-roll is a secondary video footage that you can add to your primary video(A-roll) to enhance the video creativity and aesthetic value. B-roll could be a cinematic shot, a slow-motion footage, a close-up shot from different angles, as well as a shot mixed with wide-angle, pans, and tilts.

6\. Frame Rate: Frame rate refers to the number of images or frames displayed per second in a video. In short, frame rate refers to frames per second in a video. For example, a video of 30fps means the video is showing 30 different images per second. The 24fps is used for movies and the 30fps is used for online and TV videos. Even 60fps videos are becoming common as they produce a smoother video experience.

## Part 6: How to Choose the Suitable Video Editor?

The most important part of video editing is to choose the most suitable video editor for your videos. Here are some important factors to consider while choosing a video editor.

1\. Budget and Price: If you are getting started, you can opt for a free video editor. But eventually, you have to go for a premium video editor if you are serious about video editing. You should opt for that video editor that fits your budget and offers more features for the price charged in comparison to its competitors.

2\. Learning Curve: You should always opt for a video editor that has a low learning curve. If the video editor is complicated to operate, you will get frustrated, and you won't be able to unlock the full potential of the video editor. Besides, you will have to lose a lot of time in learning and perfecting the usage of the application.

3\. Stock Library: The video editor you are choosing must have a sizeable stock media library. A stock library is where you can find video clips and audio clips that are free to use for everyone. You can incorporate them into your video to enhance the content quality and bring variety to your audiences.

4\. Audio control: Video editing is incomplete without proper audio editing. Your video editor should have a separate timeline for audio clips so that you can place them perfect to go in sync with the video clips. Some video editors have dedicated options for audio mixing and editing as per requirements.

5\. upport video formats: Your video editor must support a wide range of video file formats that you have to include from time to time. If it supports only the popular file formats, you will not be able to include the interesting videos you may get from different sources which the video editor does not support.

6\. Software stability: If you need to edit high-resolution videos, you have to ensure that the video editor you are choosing can stay stable throughout. There are many popular video editors available that become unstable while editing and rendering high-resolution videos. You have to read reviews to come to a conclusion about software stability.

7\. Customer Support: Last but most importantly, your video editor must have a good customer support team. In your video editing journey, you will need the help of technical customer support to clarify issues related to the software so that you can excel in your video editing sessions.

## Part 7: Video Editing Tips for Beginners

Here are some basic video editing tips that you should keep in mind while editing any video.

1\. Try Tight Cuts: Your video should not be too long so that it gets boring for the viewers. Therefore, you have to make tight cuts which means you have to cut out pauses, gaps between dialogs, and anything that is unnecessary for viewers. If you think that tight cuts will take more time than usual, you can consider reshooting the part to save time.

2\. Put The Story Before The Footage: When you are shooting a planned video, you must be shooting the video with multiple cameras from different angles. While editing and choosing the perfect angle for a certain video segment, you have to select the one that enhances the story you are telling through your video. For example, in an interview video, you should know when to emphasize and show close angles to capture the emotion of the speaker.

3\. Chop Out Mistakes: The most basic work in video editing is to cut out the mistakes. This is because you are sure to make mistakes while shooting, and you will reshoot a lot of mistakes to correct them. Therefore, take your time to chop out mistakes but make sure that the video feels continuous, and if required, you can reshoot. To avoid mistakes in action, you can use different camera angles, blur portions, and bleep out certain words.

4\. Learn to use color: Color correction and adjustment is a majorly neglected part of video editing that can make your video different from others. When you are shooting in outdoor conditions, the color of the video could get disturbed depending on the color of your dress as well as your surrounding. While editing, you need to correct them so that the video looks visually pleasing to the eyes.

5\. Cut to music: Audio plays a very important role in any video, and hence, you should not neglect it. Always opt for a video editor that has a good collection of stock music so that you can apply them to your video in appropriate places. Music helps to break the monotony and grab the attention of the audience instantly.

6\. Back up your work: It takes hours to shoot a video but only a second to lose it. Instead of blindingly relying on your storage device, you should take back up of your work on multiple devices. Taking backup in the cloud storage area is the best option as you can access your work from anywhere.

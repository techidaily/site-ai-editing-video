MKV file format is not as commonly used as MOV because of its poor compatibility when it comes to mobile devices. If we talk about the file size, MKV tends to have a larger file size as compared to other used formats. MOV is a container file format that can store multiple media files of different tracks. Whereas MKV is an envelope format, even supporting to store complete movies with subtitles.

MKV format was developed by Matroska, whereas Apple developed the MOV file format. MKV format is good for storing HD videos, and MOV format is great for saving movies.

### Last Words

Today's article will be fascinating for all those who want to shoot their films at home and become a filmmaker. As upon **M31, LUT (teal and orange)** is one of the most used LUTs in various films. It was first introduced in Hollywood, and there are many movies that use this style for color correction, such as the well-known _Transformers_, _Star Trek_, _Mad Max_, and _Wonder Woman_. The spectator can rapidly comprehend the information in the image and quickly tell the topic from the backdrop thanks to the two contrasting hues of teal and orange, which are more common in nature. These colors can also merge more smoothly with the rest of the image. In this article, we will discuss how to use it and other amazing LUTs in your videos. So let's begin!

To help users create current and trendy styles, Premiere Pro features a vast range of effects and tools including fade to black in premiere pro.

Going back to the days of black and white may sometimes be a welcome change of pace in the era of vivid digital and flashy film. Being a professional editor, you'll understand that editing should be undetectable. If an editor has done their job well, no one will notice their efforts. You've failed as soon as the audience realizes the cut has occurred. But fading out to black (or white) seems out of the ordinary. Use this how to fade to black premiere pro guide to learn the steps in Adobe PR.

## Part 1\. What is Fade to Black

You will become a better filmmaker if you expand your vocabulary in video editing by learning about transitions. The dissolve-to-black, or fade-to-black (a fade to black in premiere pro), works well in part because it has a certain theatrical feel to it. A fade-out/fade-down, often known as a fade-to-black in theater, occurs in total darkness. One of the key components of video editing is using transitions in Adobe Premiere Pro.

The fundamental elements of many other transitions are fades. Effective use of Fades is a crucial skill in your video editing repertoire since it is subtle to the point of practically being undetectable. A video transition called a "fade to black" causes a scene or clip to gradually conclude with a black backdrop. It dates back to the time when the stage curtains were drawn and the lights were dimmed during a theatrical performance. The stage therefore went completely black while the team behind hurriedly changed into new clothing and stage items for the following action.  

Those that seem to take place close together chronologically are edited together, while scenes that occur at separate periods or locales are faded out. These are recognizable features of the film. They alert us to the fact that the tale is moving to a later time or place, either thematically, chronologically, or geographically. In a practical sense, this is the time when the cast and crew switch out the set and clothes. But the fade-to-black marks the end of the scene in a symbolic and narrative sense.

## Part 2\. How to Fade to Black in Premiere Pro

One of the most widely used video editing programs is Adobe Premiere Pro. In Premiere Pro, a number of transitions are available. One of the first, most important responsibilities for a film editor to do is the utilization of numerous transitions. In fact, many aspiring film editors start off by learning how to fade to black in Premiere. Fortunately, creating a fade to black transition in Premiere isn't that difficult to do step by step. Everything from straightforward dissolves to wipes, slides, and zooms may be found here.

**Steps to Fade to Black in Premiere Pro:**

##### Step1Launch the Program and Refer to the Effects

After launching Adobe Premier Pro CC, simply drag the Dip to Black effect from the Effects tab to the very start or very finish of the clip you want to use. The effect may then be moved around to change its duration as needed. Add two clips to the Premiere Pro timeline.

![refer to effects pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/refer-to-effects-pr.jpg)

##### Step2 Add the fade to black transition

Drag and drop the Dip to Black effect between two clips on the timeline after selecting the Effects tab and typing "dip to black" into the search field. The right half of the clip will display the dip to black effect.

![dip and black effects pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/dip-and-black-effects-pr.jpg)

##### Step3 Customize the fade to black effect

Go to Effect Controls and, while the dip to black effect is chosen, alter the alignment to Center at Cut. Before video B starts, video A will now fade to black.

##### Step4 Optionally change the fade-to-black effect's duration

just extend the timeline's fade to black effect at the very end. The slower and smoother the fade to black effect will be, and vice versa, as you move the effect outward.

## Time Lapse Videos Play an Important Part in Videography. If You Want to Start Video Shooting, Then You Shouldn’t Miss Time Lapse Video. This Article Will Show You some Ideas over This

Are you thinking of stepping out of the familiar world of still photography to make a time-lapse video?

As you all know I am a fan of travel videos and time-lapse video because why not? There is no denying that time-lapse techniques are a perfect medium for travel videos.

In this article will give you some ideas to get started in time-lapse video or photography and let's define what a time-lapse video and what makes them great.

## What is Time Lapse

Time-lapse is a creative filming and video editing technique that manipulates how the frame rate is captured. Frame rate is the number of images or frames appearing in a second of video. In most videos, the frame rate and playback speed are the same. In a time-lapse video, the frame rate is stretched out far more: when played back at average speed, time appears to be sped up.

Time-lapse can also refer to a camera's shutter speed (How long the camera's shutter remains open to let light in). A similar effect to time-lapse is found in stop-motion videos. The subject doesn't move but seems to be in motion because it's manually or repeatedly moved and then photographed. The images are then strung together to create video-like motion.

![time lapse car video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/time-lapse-car-video.jpg)

## How Time-lapse Works

Time-lapse photography is a technique that records a scene or objects that change at a slow speed and turns it into a video that plays back at high speed.

Most time-lapse videos are projected at a speed of 30 frames per second. The frame rate of your time-lapse video can be determined in the editing process, but you will need to account for how quickly the action is taking place in the camera or your video will be a collection if stills. Consider what FPS you want to use in your video. You need to capture that many frames per second to create a time-lapse effect. If you're shooting a 10 second video at 30fps, you should end up with 300 images.

What equipment needed for time-lapse video?

Time-lapse photography requires only a few special pieces of equipment.

**1\. Camera / Smartphones**

Technically any point and shoot camera or smartphone can be used for time-lapse video, the easiest ones to work are DSLR or mirrorless cameras, some even have an in camera intervalometer (often called a time-lapse feature or time-lapse mode), which means you'll need less equipment to take great time-lapse video.

**2\. High-capacity Memory Card**

For the best results, shoot in RAW format which takes image in the highest resolution with actual image dimensions. You'll need to prepare for very large RAW file sizes, so bring multiple high capacity memory cards.

**3.Tripod**

A tripod is essential to time-lapse video or photography, because the camera needs to stay perfectly still in order to emphasize the steady movement of your subject and to avoid overlay blurry videos or photos.

## How to Capture Times-lapse Video

A technique that was once found only in video editing software is now on nearly every mobile device. So what's the best way to make an amazing time-lapse video that stands apart from the rest? That depends on how you plan to capture the footage.

**Smartphones:**

Most phones have a time-lapse feature in their camera app. Be advised: you will need to record for an extended period, as 30 minutes equates to about 10 seconds of footage. Like a video camera, you will need a tripod to steady your shots. On an iPhone, you can either film a time-lapse or stitch one together from your photo collection, all without a video editor.

**DSLR Camera**

For DSLR camera you'll need a tripod and a device called intervalometer. The first is essential to make sure your camera is stationary and is taking photos if the exact same location without moving anywhere.

An intervalometer, or a remote control, is a device that allows you to set your camera to hit the shutter button at an interval of your choice. In other words, an intervalometer is there to let you rest aside without having a manually click the shutter button yourself.

**Here are some video ideas for your time-lapse**

* Ice melting
* Flower and plants
* Clouds moving
* Sunrise/sunset
* Star movement
* Traffic movement

**Ice melting**

Time-lapse is an ideal way to capture the mesmerizing transition between water and ice. Even something as simple as watching ice melt can be appealing.

**Flower and plants**

Flowers and plants can be beautiful to behold, but their transformation from seed to adult plant is often absolutely breathtaking. If you have an indoor plant that you are about to start growing you can set up a camera on a mount of a tripod at the angle with which you want to capture. As you water, groom or fertilize on a regular schedule, you can incorporate taking a photograph at the same time.

**Clouds moving**

The clouds can provide a whole host of phenomena that will both enlighten the observer to the complexities of the atmosphere or cosmos but will also provide a beautiful spectacle in the daytime, the movement of clouds can be quite spell binding and the rolling in of rain or a thunderstorm can be particularly interesting.

**Sunrise/Sunset**

Shooting a sunset is more difficult. The light changes during the selected time period.

To overcome this, use remote control camera software. This can be compensated by increasing the ISO or decreasing the shutter speed as the light dims.

![shoot sunset timelapse video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-sunset-timelapse-video.jpg)

**Star movement**

At night, if the sky is clear and you are in an area dark enough, the stars in the sky can provide a beautiful time-lapse as the stars move in relation to the observer due to earths rotations.

**Traffic movement**

The interconnectedness of vehicles moving along busy roads, trailing light patterns, and the general hustle and bustle of city life can be brought to you in a dynamic way via time-lapse videos.

It is the smooth impression of motion which time-lapse is able to produce that can emphasize and help to invigorate something as ordinary and everyday as the coming and going of traffic.

## Motion Tracking Using The Best Video Editors

One of the powerful editing features offered by several premium-grade video editors is motion tracking. It not only boosts the overall video quality but also helps ensuring the object is engaged throughout the video. Many users fail to apply the motion tracking effect to the videos because they don’t use a reliable tool. The primary motive of this discussion is to provide you with the best-in-class motion tracker.

Not only will we tell you the name of the software, but we will also guide you through the procedure of doing this. Moreover, many of you don't know what motion tracking is. So, this article will also provide significant information about this.

## Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?

[Motion tracking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) helps you analyze the movements of different objects in your video content. This process involves various tasks that can be very helpful in video editing. For example, tracking and identifying the position of elements over time. The main purpose of motion tracking is to add graphics. Moreover, you can also add digital effects to the tracked objects.

You will need special software or video editing tools to perform this process. Here's how you can understand the motion tracking process with ease:

### Selection of Object

The editor can select the object that he wants to track in an effective manner. This object can be a person or any moving element that needs tracking. Moreover, it can also be a moving vehicle or a logo as well. Tracking these moving elements in the frame can allow the editor to improve the areas which have high contrast or distinct features.

### Tracking Points

Selecting the object allows the software to identify specific points in the frame. These points can have distinct features or a high contrast that may affect the video quality. With the help of **video motion tracking**, the editor can note down these areas and improve them to enhance the viewer experience.

### Data Mapping

Once the software tracks the movements, it can be very useful for the editor. This is because it calculates the changes in position and rotation of each point. Moreover, it also maps the tracked data into a visual representation for the coordinating system. Using this system, the movements of the objects can be recreated in a 3D space.

### Using Effects and Refinement

After obtaining the motion tracking data, the video editor can apply different effects on the object. These effects can include adding graphics and text to the scene. Moreover, it can also help in animation or compositing visual elements. To ensure the accurate alignment of the effects, the editor may need to use extra tracking techniques or manual adjustments.

We were quite surprised, in doing our research, just how successful each of these extensions is. The simple fact is that the demand for these downloads is quite high on most video-sharing sites. Of course, this is mainly because of the widespread use of such sites on the internet.

Despite the problems with the website, which are beyond the developer's control, the extension itself is worth a five-star rating. So, there's no need to crack your head trying to figure out how to grab videos from a web page. Just grab the extension of your preference, install it, point it to the video and copy the URL.

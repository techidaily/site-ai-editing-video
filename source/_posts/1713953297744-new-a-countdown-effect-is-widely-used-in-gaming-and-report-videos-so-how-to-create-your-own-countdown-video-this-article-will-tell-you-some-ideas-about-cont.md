## A Countdown Effect Is Widely Used in Gaming and Report Videos. So How to Create Your Own Countdown Video? This Article Will Tell You some Ideas About Contdown Video Editing

Have you ever wanted to use Adobe After Effects to recreate a countdown timer for a rocket launch or simply create a suspenseful moment in a video by displaying how the time runs out? This tutorial will show you how. It is imperative that you become familiar with the process of creating a countdown in After Effects.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to use Adobe After Effects to put together a countdown video. This procedure is a straightforward one, and it will handle expressions as well as plugins. Stay here and read on to find out more about the various methods in which we might accomplish this goal!

Let's begin!

## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.

## Part 2: How to blur Zoom background on Mac

Backdrop blur is the next best thing when a virtual background is unsuitable for a video conference but a consumer still needs privacy. As you can see from the description above, the blurred backdrop is just another style of the Zoom background. Customers may therefore directly adjust it from the Virtual Background setting area. Prior doing anything further, confirm that your MacBook is running the Zoom desktop client (software).

Before your Zoom call on a Mac, follow these instructions to blur your background:

Step1Start Zoom and log in to your account.

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-cloud-login.jpg)

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-settings-bg-filters.jpg)

Step3Then choose "Blur," and your backdrop will instantly seem blurred. You can also Select Stop Video by clicking the arrow next to it in the list of choices in the bar below the live video. A little list will start to appear. By using the "Choose Virtual Backdrop" option, you may choose a virtual background.

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-blur-effect-zoom.jpg)

Take these actions:

Step1Launch the Zoom app on your iOS phone in foremost step. To begin or join a new meeting, tap the "New Meeting" or "Join" icon.

## Part 4: How to blur Zoom background on Android

Additionally, Zoom blur backdrops are the ideal option for first video conversations with clients, coworkers, or supervisors. On its Android app, Zoom offers customers the option to blur their backdrop. However, there is a catch: the function can only be activated once the user has entered a meeting. If a virtual backdrop isn't your style on Android, you may choose to blur the background instead. Everything in the backdrop will be blurred, keeping just your picture apparent throughout the conversation. Remember that all of your next meetings will have the blur function turned on. How? Read on.

Step1Only while you're in a meeting can you alter your backdrop. Tap the More icon in the bottom right corner after joining one.

### 1\. RE: Vision Effects ReelSmart Motion Blur

RSMB is a powerful motion blur plugin that contains various advanced features. By adding this motion blur plugin, you can instantly add a motion blur effect to your videos without any manual effort.

**Download:** ReelSmart shows great compatibility with popular software such as Premiere Pro, After Effects, and many more. However, the subscription and download plans for each software are different. So, if you want to learn more about this plugin, you can navigate to its [official website](https://revisionfx.com/products/rsmb/premiere-pro/).

**Key Features**

* RSMB uses automatic tracking for each pixel so that the motion blur effect can be applied with great precision.

**What We Like**

* Apart from adding a motion blur effect, you can also use RSMB to remove this blur effect without compromising the quality of your video.

**What We Don’t Like**

* A wide range of advanced features is only available in the pro version of RSMB. Thus, it can be expensive for beginner users.

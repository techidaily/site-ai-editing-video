## 6 Best MP4 Mergers to Join Videos Easily

Not all software allows you to combine videos in the MP4 format. And even if they do, the quality you get is not satisfying. The reason is pretty basic – overrated and underrated video merging software. Some tools are complicated, while others are extremely user-friendly with the interface and options.

So, after spending several days on the research, finally, here are the **6 best mp4 mergers** along with their tutorials to help you understand the process and complexity of each software and pick the best one in terms of simplicity and user-friendliness.

#### In this article

01 [Free Video Joiner](#part1)

02 [Freemake Video Converter](#part2)

03 [Boilsoft Video Joiner](#part3)

04 [Media Cope](#part4)

05 [MP4Joiner by MP4Tools](#part5)

06 [Filmora by Wondershare](#part6)

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

### Merging Videos in Free Video Joiner

**Step1: Download Free Video Joiner**

Open your browser and go to the [Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) website. Then, click the “Download” button on the page to save the setup on your computer.

**Step 2: Install and Run Free Video Joiner**

Now, double-click on the Free Video Joiner set up to install it in your system. It will hardly take a few seconds for the entire software to get into your system’s hard drive.

## Part 2: Freemake Video Converter (For Windows Users Only)

[Freemake Video Converter](https://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter2/) is reliable software to convert videos without registration. The program is free to download with more than 180 million users worldwide. And not just the MP4, but you can convert videos in all the popular formats and use the program to copy and burn DVDs.

Apart from the video conversion feature, you can use Freemake to merge your MP4 videos from your Windows operating system. However, the software is unavailable for MAC users, and it is one of the major drawbacks of this video merger.

### Merging Videos in Freemake Video Converter

**Step 1: Download Freemake Video Converter**

First, go to the [Freemake Video Converter](https://www.freemake.com/free%5Fvideo%5Fconverter2/) website and click on the “Free Download” button.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-11.jpeg)

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-12.jpeg)

**Step 2: Add Videos**

Click on the “Video” tab from the top menu to select videos you want to merge.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-13.jpeg)

As you can see below, two videos are uploaded on the software.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-14.jpeg)

**Step 3: Rearrange Video Order**

If you wish to rearrange the videos, you can do it by simply dragging the video up or down with the help of your mouse.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-15.jpeg)

For example, the “Photo Slideshow” video, which was previously on the top, is now placed beneath the “Intro” video.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

That means the merged video will begin from the “Intro” video, and then the “Photo Slideshow” will continue right after the first clip ends. All be done without any break or pause.

**Step 4: Join Videos**

After rearranging the videos, use your mouse to select clips by clicking once on each video. All selected videos will be highlighted in the “light blue” color.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-17.jpeg)

Then, take the mouse cursor on the top-right side of the software and turn on the “Join Files” button by clicking on it.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-18.jpeg)

You will see that a merged video will be added to the software.

For instance, you can see that a new file has been added to the interface, showing the number of merged files in the red circle.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-19.jpeg)

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-51.jpeg)

Then, drag-and-drop the videos to your timeline. But make sure that you place both clips on the same timeline. As you can see below, there are two clips. The first clip is named “Travel 05,” while the second video is called “Travel 06.”

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-52.jpeg)

**Step 3: Fill the Gap to Merge**

When you will drag-and-drop videos on the timeline, the chances are that there will be a gap or a blank space between the two clips, like this.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-53.jpeg)

If this blank space is left untreated, the merged video will include this empty black space, as you can see on the preview screen.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-54.jpeg)

Therefore, use your right mouse click to hold the second video and drag it to the wall of the first video without leaving any gap in between both clips.

## Bottom Line

Among the 6 best MP4 mergers, Filmora seems to be winning. It’s not just a video editor with plenty of tools, but you can also join two or more videos in MP4 format without sacrificing the video quality.

On the other hand, video merges like Free Video Joiner, Freemake, Media Cope, Boilsoft Video Joiner, and MP4 Joiner have limited options. Plus, they are time-consuming, and some of them even disturb the video and audio quality when clips are merged through them.

## FAQs

### Q1\. What is the best video merger for MP4?

There are many excellent video mergers to combine MP4 videos. Most users recommend Filmora because it works flawlessly on MAC and Windows operating systems. Besides, it’s a user-friendly software that even non-professional people can use to join MP4 videos.

### Q2\. What is the fastest video merger for MP4 clips?

Filmora by Wondershare is one of the fastest video mergers. You can merge videos by working on the timeline, which ultimately saves your time.

Although they are a bit old-fashioned, you will still find them more accessible and fast than other MP4 mergers.

### Q3\. How do I merge MP4 videos without losing quality?

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

**Step 3: Rearrange Video Order**

If you wish to rearrange the videos, you can do it by simply dragging the video up or down with the help of your mouse.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-15.jpeg)

For example, the “Photo Slideshow” video, which was previously on the top, is now placed beneath the “Intro” video.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

That means the merged video will begin from the “Intro” video, and then the “Photo Slideshow” will continue right after the first clip ends. All be done without any break or pause.

**Step 4: Join Videos**

After rearranging the videos, use your mouse to select clips by clicking once on each video. All selected videos will be highlighted in the “light blue” color.

## Bottom Line

Among the 6 best MP4 mergers, Filmora seems to be winning. It’s not just a video editor with plenty of tools, but you can also join two or more videos in MP4 format without sacrificing the video quality.

On the other hand, video merges like Free Video Joiner, Freemake, Media Cope, Boilsoft Video Joiner, and MP4 Joiner have limited options. Plus, they are time-consuming, and some of them even disturb the video and audio quality when clips are merged through them.

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

If you wish to rearrange the videos, you can do it by simply dragging the video up or down with the help of your mouse.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

That means the merged video will begin from the “Intro” video, and then the “Photo Slideshow” will continue right after the first clip ends. All be done without any break or pause.

**Step 4: Join Videos**

After rearranging the videos, use your mouse to select clips by clicking once on each video. All selected videos will be highlighted in the “light blue” color.

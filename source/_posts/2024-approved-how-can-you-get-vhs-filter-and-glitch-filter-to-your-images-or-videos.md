**Step 3: Cut Down the Clip for Video Editing**

At first, you need to clip the part of the video where you want to add the **slow zoom effect TikTok.** Place the red indicator across the pointer where you want to start the part and hit the split icon. Drag the indicator across the next frames to the point where you want to keep the audio. You will have a separate clip now.

**Step 4: Specify Slow Speed of Clip**

Select the clip and find the “Speed” icon across the menu above the timeline of the interface. Select the appropriate speed from the drop-down menu that appears on the screen. Go into the “Slow” section and select speeds like 0.5x to slow down the clip speed.

**Step 5: Include Animation Keyframes**

Proceed to add animation keyframes on the specific clip. Right-click on it and select “Add Animation” from the menu. Proceed into the “Animation” tab and find the “Customize” section across the screen. Move the indicator to the point where you want to add the first keyframe and hit “Add.” Move the indicator further across the clip to add the second keyframe across it. The reason for adding multiple keyframes is to set up the animation keyframe across the TikTok clip.

Locate the “Scale” option among them and manage the scaling of the clip through the slider percentages. Once done, click on the "Export" button to download the edited TikTok.

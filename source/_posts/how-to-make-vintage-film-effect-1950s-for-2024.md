## How to Make Vintage Film Effect 1950S

So, what's the difference between a vintage film shot in the 1920s and 1950s? It's simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let's learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.

## Preparation ![1950 vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1950-vintage-scene.gif)

Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn't need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It's even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent's collection.

How to create a 1950s vintage film:

##### Step 1 Add your video on Filmora

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later ![add your video on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-1.jpg)

First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.

##### Step 2 Apply a cropping effect to the video ![apply a cropping effect to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-2.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and choose the **Crop** effect under the **Utility** folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.

![click the effect tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-3.jpg)

Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.

##### Step 3 Add a Warm Film color effect ![add a warm film color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-4.jpg)

Up to here, you'll realize that your video doesn't still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the **3D LUT** option under the **Color** category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose **Warm Film**. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.

##### Step 4 Apply more graininess to the film ![apply more graininess to the film](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Please don't stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the **Overlay** menu under the Effects tab, then click **Old Film**. After that, choose the **Random Dust, Dirty Film,** and **Subtle Grain** effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.

If you want to grab your audience's attention and keep them engaged with your videos, then Instagram Reels should be your destination.

## Part I. Basic Understanding of Instagram Reels

1. **What are Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels are short-duration, vertically-oriented videos that are displayed in the dedicated reels tab on the Instagram app. You can compare Instagram Reels with TikTok videos. The maximum duration of Instagram Reels can be of 90 seconds.

Instagram displays the popular Reels on Explore tab so that the Instagram Reels creators get more exposure. Since short-duration videos and apps are in trend, Instagram Reels has become the most popular section on the Instagram app.

Reels can be entertaining videos with popular songs in the background. They can be funny videos as well as gripping slow-motion videos. Brands promote their products and services through Reels. You can add stunning AR effects and change the speed of the video while recording Reels through the Instagram app.

1. **Why Should You Make Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels have been a game-changer in the social media world. From regular video creators and social media influencers to brands and businesses, Instagram Reels has become everyone's real deal. Here are the reasons why you should make Instagram Reels:

**Reach** \- The primary reason for making Instagram Reels is to reach out to the target audiences and get more followers. If your videos become popular, your Instagram Reels can get featured in the Explore tab. Once it does happen, there will be an exponential rise in views and followers. Besides, Instagram Reels have better reach to your followers than regular Instagram posts.

**Engagement** \- The world has moved on from photos to videos. People love to check out short videos rather than still images. So naturally, when you start making Instagram reels, your followers' engagement will increase dramatically. With more engagement, your Reels will get more exposure as people will love to share them with their friends. Of course, the content has to be top-notch so that people start to pay attention to your Reels.

## Part III. Speed Up Existing Videos for Reels

When you have already recorded the video for Reels, you need to use a third-party tool to change the video speed. Depending on the device you are going to use to edit the speed of your video, you have to select an appropriate video editing application. We have handpicked the best applications to change Instagram Reels video speed for computers, smartphones as well as online users.

1. **Speed Up Video for Instagram Reels on PC**

A professional video creator always prefers a computer to edit videos minutely. This is because a computer's dedicated video editor has far more editing options than a video editor app or even an online video editor. If you have filmed and transferred the video to your computer, you can change its speed easily. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the best video editor to alter video speed precisely as you need.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

There are various options available to change the speed of a video. You can choose from the speed presets for instant change. You can customize the speed through the Uniform Speed option. Besides, you can use Speed Ramping to vary the speed of the video differently for different sections. Most importantly, Filmora is super easy to use despite being a professional video editing software.

**A Step-by-step Guide to speed up a video on Filmora**

Instead of choosing from the speed presets, using the Uniform Speed option is always handy to speed up your video. This is because speed presets are limited and may not be suitable for your video. That is why Uniform Speed is effective, as you can set any desired speed up to 100X.

Here are the steps to speed up a Reels video (already recorded) using Filmora

The frame rate sometimes makes or breaks the video. So it is important to get this setting right. Suppose you made a mistake and recorded your video in the wrong setting. You can follow this guide to solve your problem.

## How To Check Video Frame Rate in Premiere Pro

Before we teach you how to change a video's frame rate in Premiere Pro, let's first make sure you know how to check. Maybe you don't need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.

So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?

1. Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Check the "Media" window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for "frames per second," which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.

![check video frame rate in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-frame-rate-premiere-pro.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Reasons for Changing Frame Rate

Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.

Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.

However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the "soap opera effect." It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem "unnatural" or less cinematic.

High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That's great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it's also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.

With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video's frame rate.

## How To Change FPS in Premiere Pro

Let's dilly-dally no more. Here's a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.

### l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence

Suppose you want to keep the frame rate of most of the video the same. Only some parts need adjusting. You can change the frame rate of the sequences that need changing instead. Here are the steps to follow to achieve this:

1. Open your project in Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.
3. Choose "Sequence Settings" from the menu that appears.

## How To Make 120 FPS Videos With Premiere Pro

Videos that are 120 fps are very popular now. If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You'd want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.

Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it's a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That's obviously not the number that we want. Don't worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it's super easy.

Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:

1. Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, "Drop media here to create sequence."

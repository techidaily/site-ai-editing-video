No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?

If this issue arises in your program, you'll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.

The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.

It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.

* Start the program on your computer's operating system.

* Select Edit from the drop-down menu.

* Look towards preference

WonderShare Filmora streamlines the video editing process through the use of intelligent, intuitive features that can automate repetitive tasks and save time.

Individuals can subscribe to WonderShare Filmora for a one-year fee of $68.98 per year. Filmora is well-known as a straightforward video editor designed for novice users and social media influencers who want to devote more time to their creative endeavors. A few new features have been added, and we can now create professional-looking videos without having to go through a lengthy learning curve.

#### Features that Stand Out

For both new and experienced film creators, WonderShare Filmora has been designed to offer a scalable environment. Even if you've never edited a movie before, you can start doing so right now.

**Millions of Free Media to Choose From:**

Over 10 million media files are available in the stock media library of WonderShare Filmora, making it easy for filmmakers to bring their visions to life. Speed ramping and auto beat sync are also included.

**Toolbar Quick Access:**

After the application is installed on your computer, the toolbar allows rapid access to all the program's capabilities. These features include media and audio files, titles, effects, split-screen formatting, components, transitions, and other elements.

**Quick Editing Feature:**

For content producers who don't want to spend hours on video editing and instead want to concentrate on other areas of their work, WonderShare Filmora is the appropriate solution.

**Use Animated Transitions to Bring Life into Your Videos:**

Your video may get tedious if you repeatedly use the same frame. Animated transitions may be added to video and photo collages using the Split Screen feature. Using this feature, you may divide your screen into as many as six individual displays.

**Improved Speed Ramping Function:**

WonderShare Filmora's new speed ramping functionality is one of the most intriguing new additions. The speed of a video clip may be gradually increased or decreased with this tool, and the transition between the various speed levels is smooth.

**Capture Every Scene with Ease:**

Using a slew of cameras, skilled videographers may capture the same topic from a variety of vantage points. A single camera may be used in certain circumstances to record the whole scene and a close-up, while others may be used to capture a variety of views and expressions.

WonderShare Filmora has 115 video themes, including business, travel, vlogging, slideshows, and many more. It's possible to make a whole movie using Filmora AI by letting it figure out the best way to edit your video.

### How to speed up Playback in Filmora?

For a "close up in time," the slow-motion effect may be the best choice, while the fast-forward effect may be used to make dramatic or humorous videos, depending on your tastes.

Filmora's user-friendly interface and simple editing capabilities have made it a popular choice for professionals throughout the globe. As a result, many people prefer it over alternative editing software.

## Sometimes, when It Comes to Editing a Video, We Don’t Even Know Where to Start, because There Are Too Many Options –Online Platforms Which Instantly Help Us Edit Our Clips, without Lengthy Process of Downloading and Installing Computer Programs

Sometimes, when it comes to editing a video, we don’t even know where to start, because there are too many options –online platforms which instantly help us edit our clips, without lengthy process of downloading and installing computer programs;

Mobile applications with user-friendly interface, allowing us to manipulate the footage quickly, easily choose our preferred formats and effects and adjust the clips according to the requirements our target platforms set; more time-consuming and advanced software with even more options, but which seem to require us to be more skilled and experienced in editing.

Even though editing, as other innovative and creative actions, is limitless in its possibilities, sometimes we just need to make a little change in our project and it’s quite enough for us to be satisfied with our work and material. One of the things which is rather simple to do, but sometimes essential, when it comes to making our clips better and more picturesque for the audience, is cropping a video.

Cropping, in its essence, is great to “hide” some unnecessary objects in our video, and/or highlight the main ones. In this article, we discuss how to crop a video in a software called DaVinci Resolve, in simple little steps, how to export our work and lastly, what would be the alternate way to do the same in other computer program.

## Part 1\. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve

First and foremost, let’s get to know Davinci Resolve! As mentioned above, it is a software, so let’s be well-aware that we have to download and install it on our computer systems. Of course, it takes a bit of time, but to be able to use an advanced software, it’s totally worth it. If we are to search for the information about Davinci Resolve, we come across the following description: “color grading and non-linear video editing application for macOS, Windows, and Linux”. So, no matter which system we have, we can count on this software, which is a real advantage!

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-1.jpeg)

To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c).

Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!

First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.

Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.

The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if/when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.

**1\. History and Current Policies**

Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.

**2\. Accessibility**

Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.

**3\. Deletion**

The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.

## Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?

The software lets us to log and transfer videos onto a hard drive, where it can be edited, processed, and output to a wide variety of formats. Final Cut Pro is so advanced that it is used by hobbyist filmmakers and industry professionals in TV, Film, and media. Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99\. It’s evident that Final Cut Pro can’t be downloaded, installed, and thus used on Windows, which is unfortunate, but for Mac users, it’s a very powerful video editing software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-1.jpeg)

What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:

* Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;
* Blazing pro performance;
* Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;
* The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.

One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.

The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM), with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-2.jpeg)

Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-23.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..

Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-26.jpeg)

Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-27.jpeg)

Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-28.jpeg)

Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-29.jpeg)

After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.

So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.

And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..

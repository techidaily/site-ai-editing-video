This method is suitable if you have shot a video at a higher frame rate. This method is also plain and requires a few clicks to complete. Following is the detailed guide to creating a **DaVinci Resolve slow-motion smooth**:

**Step 1:** Once you have imported the video in the timeline, navigate towards the Media Pool. From there, find your clip, right-click on it, and click the "Clip Attributes" option.

![access clip attributes settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-in-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** From the Clip Attributes window, go to the "Video" tab and expand "Video Frame Rate." From the appearing frame rate options, select a lesser frame rate.

**Step 3:** To sync the audio with your clip, navigate towards the timeline panel. Select the audio track and right-click on it to access settings. From the options menu, locate and uncheck the “Link Clips” option.

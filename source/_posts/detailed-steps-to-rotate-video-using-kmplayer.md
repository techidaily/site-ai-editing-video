## Right Tools for Converting 60FPS Frame Rate in Videos

One of the primary things that differentiate a good video from a low-quality one is its frame rate or burst rate. This refers to the frequency of a series of images or frames consecutively appearing during display. A low frame rate per second or FPS causes issues in most display screens, so you will need a **60 FPS video converter** to update it.

You need to **convert or make video 60FPS online** through tools and software to improve the sharpness of frame speed and make it suitable for streaming sites like YouTube that play 60FPS only or create UHD/4K videos. Plus, most high-definition screens for gaming, computers, tablets, and smartphones require high FPS.

This article will teach you the best solutions to make the conversion possible. Choose your option after a full evaluation.

## Part I. What does 60 FPS mean?

Before discussing the best tools available for frame rate conversion, you should know what frame rate is. Also known as update rate, this signifies the frequency of the display of consecutive series of frames or images. The speed of how they appear determines the fluid play of the video with no interruption or lag.

In the context of video and film cameras, motion capture systems, and computer graphics, you should try to **convert video to 60FPS**. There are multiple types available, like the low 24FPS or 30FPS or the higher 60FPS or 120FPS. 60FPS is the most accepted option for diverse operating systems, screens, and graphics.

### Differences between 24FPS, 30FPS, and 60FPS

Here are the differences you will note between the three common frame rates per second in videos. For a simple overview, these differences are expressed in tabular form.

| **24FPS**           | **30FPS**                                                                                     | **60FPS**                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Description**     | This universally acceptable frame rate choice is used for transferring video signals to film. | 30FPS is a slightly higher frame rate choice for animations and show videos that are suitable for television viewing and online platforms. | Videos at 60FPS have better fluency and smoother definition, with sharp videos that work during gaming, high-definition streaming, and UHD/4K video editing. |
| **Types of videos** | Older videos and films.                                                                       | Online videos, TV shows, and news.                                                                                                         | HD-quality movies, online videos, and games.                                                                                                                 |
| **Users**           | Movie suppliers                                                                               | Entertainment and Media professionals.                                                                                                     | Movie producers, video editors, gaming software developers, etc.                                                                                             |

### Why Should You Convert Videos into 60FPS?

In the context of video FPS, the three variations- 30FPS, 60FPS, and 24FPS are the most common. However, there are specific reasons why 60FPS is the best option you should use, and take the time to convert your files with this frame rate.

* Playing 24FPS or 30FPS videos on LCD screens have more prominent motion blur, the sharpness of transition is low and rough, etc.
* Well-known streaming sites like YouTube set their standard for videos at 60FPS. If you use a file with a higher FPS, it will compress to 60FPS automatically. Anything lower than that is unacceptable since it creates a laggy video transition.
* Creating high-quality movies in UHD or 4K resolution requires a high FPS like 60FPS. Movies shot with 24FPS do not assure the best display in the native frame rate and need pulldown conversion. This causes judder, which affects video quality. Converting the video to **60fps ai online** is a better choice.
* Modern devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets have a high refresh rate. So, these, including some gaming monitors and television varieties, accept videos with 60FPS best.
* In animation, most creators run 3-4 images per drawing, which means 6 or 8 drawings per second. For the best transition between shorts and images, converting the animation videos to 60FPS is useful.

## Does Windows 10 have built-in video editing software?

The answer is yes. Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn't work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.

You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You'll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.

Some people say that windows video editor has a very simple interface and it only has very basic features. In this case, having something is more important than not having anything at all. Also, you should keep in mind that not everyone needs a fully-fledged [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Some people have to do just basic tasks like trimming a video and increasing the brightness of a video. It is not feasible for them to purchase expensive video editing software for that purpose.

## How to Add Video Effects with Movavi Slideshow Maker

Many video editors won't be late in their artwork. They tend to use different effects to light up their crafts. For them, editing videos with effects applications gives more life to the story. In this composition, you will learn more about Effects, and if you are just about to do your video editing right now, these details are definitely for you.

## What are Video Effects?

According to the dictionary, an effect is brought about by a cause or an agency.

In video editing, there are a few video effects you must know to apply them to your video project. Video effects can alter the speed and produce distortions, reflections, aesthetic filters, stylistic color grading, animation transitions, and more. They can also contain 3D features like CGI. When used well, these effects improve the narrative, the atmosphere, and the images' overall impact.

Let's dissect a few of the major effects, which will be most helpful to you.

**Pans and Tilts**

Your first thought upon hearing these two words may be tripod motions. Pans and tilts are a quick way to add additional movement and sensation to your video, making it more dynamic.

**Change the Speed/Duration**

One feature that virtually every NLE or Non-Linear Editing software gives us is the option to modify the playback speed of your video while reducing or increasing the actual duration and tempo of your segments. Slowing down your footage to match the frame rate at which the video was initially captured is one of the critical explanations for doing this.

To incorporate some frantic or chaotic moments into your production, you can use this to generate slow-motion shots and fast-forward effects. This effect can also quickly pan through footage for humorous effect. Find the "Speed/Duration" option under Effects controls to accomplish this.

**Light Leaks and Flares**

Nothing gives your video a more ethereal vibe than gentle, warm light emerging from the scene. A direct source visible in the photo may be the source of this light, or it may enter the frame from the edge. You've probably seen these flares and leaks countless times in movies, whether they were added in post-production or resulted from the cinematographer's lens choice. You can select where the light comes from if it doesn't distract from the task. Remember that these spills and flares must contribute to the narrative while remaining barely perceptible to the viewer.

**Retro/VHS Effects**

While light leaks and lens flares give your movie or film a timeless feel, nothing gives it a dated or, one would say, "scrappy" vibe. The grunge appearance of the '90s is in right now, and one of the most popular effects is the VHS look.

There are several ways to get this effect. Applying a preset, essentially a LUT (look-up table or filter), to your color grade will make the image appear fuzzier, desaturated, and blurrier (using the different alpha and gamma channels). This will cause "chroma errors," which result from poor recordings and a lack of a flying erase head (a function that enables you to record over previously filmed video; imagine formatting your SD card while the video is still present on the card and you are simply recording over it), giving your images an outline of distorted blues and reds.

**Color Grading and Color Correction**

Besides actual editing, color grading and correction are arguably the most significant post-production steps. With the help of these tools, you may alter skin tones, highlight, and shadow levels, add vignettes, experiment with contrast, and much more. We'll briefly go through one aspect of color grading—the ability to adjust particular colors in your image—even though this subject needs its ebook.

**Adding Overlays**

Although we've talked about adding overlays, such as VHS effects or light leaks, you may use many other editing overlays to add particular components to your shot, including weather particles!

**Using Titles and Motion Graphics**

Motion graphics and clean titles are essential for any video that wishes to appear professional. These could be subtitles, and the animation logo reveals post-credits, lower thirds, or even major titles. There are various free typefaces available that you may use to make your project stand out, regardless of the program you're working in.

Once you've selected the appropriate font, color, and weight, it's time to move on to motion graphics. These are crucial because they may transform a clear, ageless title or text into a lively, entertaining illustration of the product or concept your movie is attempting to market.

The abundance of tutorials nowadays makes learning the fundamentals of motion graphics a piece of cake. As I previously stated, you can access all the various effects and movements you might need, regardless of the editing program, you use.

These various methods and approaches need the practice to perfect, just like any other component of filmmaking. As you add these video editing effects to your editing toolkit, there will undoubtedly be a lot of trial and error. Still, eventually, they will become second nature to your workflow.

**Importance of Applying Effects to your Video**

Almost from the first motion film, cinematic storytelling and video effects have gone hand in hand. They can improve a scene, create something that doesn't exist, hide an error, and do much more. In essence, they assist a filmmaker in telling a tale in the manner they desire.

## Applying Effects using Movavi Slideshow Maker

Making picture collages is less appealing than slide show presentations. This method is ideal for presenting a gallery of images or creating a polished photo-video presentation for your brand and goods. You'll need a creative slideshow program with loads of capabilities to create a polished slideshow that will enhance your production. The Movavi Slideshow Maker now comes into play.

In this composition, I will show you how to apply "Effects" on your video using Movavi Slideshow Maker video editing software. A professional slideshow program called Movavi slideshow creator is made for usage by both professional and amateur picture editors. It is a Mac and Windows PC freemium program with many options to give your slideshow presentation a polished and distinctive appearance.

**Features of Movavi Slideshow Maker**

_Take note that this software is not just for editing pictures but also for videos._

Step1 Click the **Import** tab.

![click import movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-import-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Click “**Add Files**” and locate your desired video to edit.

![drag video to track movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-video-to-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

## Applying Filter effects

A video filter is software that modifies a multimedia stream somehow. A filter graph is a series of filters that each accept input from an upstream filter, process the information, and then output the edited video to their downstream counterparts.

Step1 Click the **Filter** tab.

![click filter movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-filter-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Choose your desired Filter effects depending on your preferred category.

![apply filter movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/apply-filter-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step3 You can see the preview of a Filter effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.

![preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/preview-filter-effect-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step4 If you finally chose a Filter effect, drag it onto the imported video.

Step5 And now you will see the changes. The “star” symbol on the imported video means you have already applied a Filter effect on it.

![star symbol movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/star-symbol-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

**Raw Footage vs With Applied Filter Effect**

_Raw Footage_

![raw footage movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/raw-footage-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

_Brush – Sketch Filter effect_

![brush sketch filter effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/brush-sketch-filter-effect.jpg)

## Adding Transition Effect

Transitions guide your audience.

From the opening to the very end, they structure the movie. There are numerous typical forms, including the wipe, dissolve, split-cut, and many others. Film editors use transitions to transfer a scene from one video clip to another practice. Transitions don't need to be visible.

Step1 Click the **Transition** tab.

![click transition movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-transition-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Choose your desired Transition effect depending on your preferred category.

![select transition movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-transition-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step3 You can see the preview of a Transition effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.

![preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/preview-filter-effect-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step4 If you finally chose a Transition effect, drag it between each imported video.

![choose to add transition movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-to-add-transition-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step5 Now you will see this kind of symbol, which means you have already put a Transition effect between the imported videos.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**_Note:_** Transition effects can also be applied even if you have only one video. You can put transitions effects either at the start of the video, which could make your video introduction more appealing. Also, you can set the Transition effect at the end of the video, which could give you a pleasant closing.

_Transition Effect at the start_

_Transition Effect at the end_

_Also, you can make your Transition effect longer or shorter simply by clicking this symbol then it will turn yellow. Point your cursor either on the left side of the symbol; the cursor will become a horizontal double-arrow to change the span of your Transition effect on the left video or on the right end side of the symbol to change the span of the Transition effect on the right video._

## Applying Titling Motion Effect

Most video editing applications come with built-in titling choices, and many of them vary from basic letters to a collection of motion graphics that have already been pre-programmed. Enter your text into a template to insert them.

The majority of video projects have crucial titles. You can use them to build a mood, label key elements of the film, and convey information.

Step1 Click the **Title** tab.

![select title movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-title-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Choose your desired Titling motion effect depending on your preferred category. You can also see the preview of a title effect by clicking it before applying it to your selected video to be edited.

![select title motion movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-title-motion-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step3 To apply the Title Motion effect, drag the effect onto the title track, just above the video track.

![drag title motion track movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-title-motion-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step4 You can place your Title Motion effect on your desired time where you want it to appear.

![customize title position movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-title-position-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step5 To edit your Title texts, you can double-click the applied title on the title track or right-click on it and click the “edit” option. You can also edit the text by double-clicking the title portion on the current video editing.

![edit title text movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-title-text-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step6 In this step, you can edit the Title text in the “clip editing” section, as seen in the red color box. You can change the color, text style, and font size on the yellow color box. And in the green color box, you can change the alignment of the text; you can Bold it, Italizing, and make it an Underlined text.

![add color text title movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-color-text-title-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step7 You can also adjust the time duration of the Titling Motion effect in two ways.

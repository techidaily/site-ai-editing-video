Step6 Check the box. Then, click **OK** to save your changes.

## Part 5\. Copy and Paste Effects

Copy and paste are one of the oldest tricks in editing procedures. Wondershare Filmora comes with a range of commands and features that allow you to save time and be reliable.

### How to Copy and Paste Effects

## Part 6\. Timeline Snap

You might have added multiple videos in the same timeline track. If you removed the video ahead of the video clip, you have to close the gap in between.

### How to Apply Timeline Snap in Filmora

**Timeline snapping** will allow you to arrange video clips side by side without any breaks and cut-offs. Also, it will enable you to place it precisely above other video and audio gaps in the timeline.

## Part 8\. Group Clips Together

Now in an editing timeline, you might encounter a situation where you want to arrange a video clip with specific audio. Again, it allows you to stay organized and save up a lot of time.

Your whole group will be selected whenever you select a video clip or an audio clip.

## Part 9\. Pan and Zoom Shortcut

Editing shortcuts are excellent. They allow you to save up a lot of time. Some people prefer to use a mouse only to edit their videos, but professionals always use a keyboard.

But there are some other shortcuts too! In these shortcuts, you would not necessarily need a keyboard; only a mouse will work and give a good outcome.

You might have seen those videos in which a specific screen ratio moves over a picture. Or, in some cases when you have to pan and zoom to create a flow effect.

Instead of **manually** adjusting the ratio of your videos and photos, Pan and Zoom shortcuts will allow you to use multiple features. These features allow you to select where your video or photo will start, zoom, and end.

These shortcuts are so easy to apply. Just go through the steps below, and you will accomplish the following:

Step1 **Right-click** on a photo or a video clip.

Step2 Go to the **crop** and zoom tab above the timeline.

Step3 In the window that opens up, you will see a **pan and zoom** option in the top left corner. Click on it.

## Part 2\. Customize Proxy Files

Before understanding the custom proxy settings, let us know what proxy files are.

### Proxy Files

Proxy files in Wondershare Filmora allow you to render and edit **4K** and other higher-resolution videos easily, regardless of your computer's processing power.

No one wants to compromise PC performance when editing videos. But if you are importing a video with a higher resolution than your PC, you can only play it sometimes. Other than that, your PC might get stuck and slow down.

If your PC has a built-in resolution of **1080p,** but the video you are going to import is **2160p**, you can encounter rendering and performance problems. But in the case of Wondershare Filmora Proxy files, you can smoothly edit your videos without any trouble.

### How to Customize Proxy Files in Filmora

Although Wondershare Filmora automatically creates proxy files when it encounters resolutions more significant than the PC performance. But you can also set them to your preference.

And customize your proxy files takes some simple and easy steps. But first, follow the steps mentioned below.

Step1 Find the **File** option on the top left corner of the Wonderhsare Filmora home interface.

Step2 Click on Files and go to **Preferences**.

Step3 A window will pop up, and here you can see multiple options.

Step4 Go to the **performance**.

Step5 In the performance tab, scroll down till your see **Proxy**.

![wondershare filmora customizing proxy files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-2.png)

Step7 Below you can see multiple options. In these options, select the **resolution** that you want.

Step8 You can also **click** on the box below to automatically delete the proxies when you close your project.

Now, whenever you encounter a resolution of a higher video than the one you selected, Wondershare Filmora will do its magic.

## Part 3\. Delete Project Render Cache

Another hack you can use to save space on your hard drive is Deleting the Render cache. But before we do that, let us understand what Render cache is!

### What is Render Cache?

Rendering can be a giant leap to give you a smooth performance experience. However, when you import your videos into the timeline, you can always render to have an uninterrupted playback experience.

Doing so will allow you to work in your zone quickly and efficiently. You can do a manual rendering before you begin the editing process. Or you can also opt to choose automatic rendering. In the automatic rendering option, you can continue your editing process. In the meantime, your timeline will be rendered.

### How to Delete Render Cache in Filmora

To save up storage space on your computer, you can delete your render cache by following the steps.

Step1 Click on **files** in the top left corner of the Wondershare Filmora home interface.

Step2 Go to **Preferences**.

Step3 A window will pop up and go to **Performance**.

Step4 In the performance tab, scroll down below to the **Preview Render**.

Step5 Check the box saying, **"Automatically delete render files when a project is closed."**

![wondershare filmora deleting render cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-3.png)

Step6 Click on **OK** to save your changes.

Now, whenever you close your project, your render cache will be deleted and would have given you extra space on your computer.

## Part 4\. Remove Split Button on Playhead

In some instances, when you are moving the playhead on the timelines, it can distract you from doing your editing. Or even more, you can mistakenly click on the Split button to split the clips you don't want them to.

Well, no worries at all! Wondershare Filmora takes care of that for you. You can hide or remove the Split button on the playhead. It only takes a few simple and easy steps. Follow the steps mentioned below to remove the Split button:

Step1 You will notice the **File** option on the top left corner of the Wonderhsare Filmora home interface.

Step2 Click on **Files** and go to **Preferences**.

Step3 A window will pop up, and here you can see multiple options.

Step4 Go to the **editing**

Step5 In the editing tab, scroll down till your see the **Split button**.

![wondershare filmora removing the split button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-4.png)

Step6 Check the box. Then, click **OK** to save your changes.

Doing so would have removed the Split button from your playhead. So now you can edit your videos without any distractions.

## Part 5\. Copy and Paste Effects

Copy and paste are one of the oldest tricks in editing procedures. Wondershare Filmora comes with a range of commands and features that allow you to save time and be reliable.

Suppose you want to add an effect to a video clip in the timeline. Then, after adding the effect to your video, make custom changes to make it look more closely to the style you want. You can now use the copy-and-paste function to add the same effect to another clip. That helps you save a lot of time from tedious and time-consuming work.

### How to Copy and Paste Effects

While editing, you will need to ensure that your editing process is as clean as possible and that you have all the time on hand.

But there is a solution! You can easily copy and paste the effects you placed on one video clip to another. Just follow the steps mentioned, and you will be good to go:

Step1 **Right**\-**click** on the video to you added the effects too.

Step2 A drop-down column will pop up.

Step3 In the options below, you will notice an option called "**Copy Effects**."

Step4 **Click** on the "Copy Effects" option.

Step5 Now move the **playhead** to the video clip on which you want to paste the effects.

Step6 Right-click on the video that you want to **place** the effect on.

Step7 In the pop-up column, select the **Paste Effect**

Step8 It adjusts the video clip according to the changes of the prior one.

You can save editing time by simply copying and pasting video effects.

![wondershare filmora copy and paste effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-5.png)

## Part 6\. Timeline Snap

You might have added multiple videos in the same timeline track. If you removed the video ahead of the video clip, you have to close the gap in between.

So, arranging and moving clips in the timeline are hectic and time-consuming. However, that is the case without timeline snapping.

### How to Apply Timeline Snap in Filmora

**Timeline snapping** will allow you to arrange video clips side by side without any breaks and cut-offs. Also, it will enable you to place it precisely above other video and audio gaps in the timeline.

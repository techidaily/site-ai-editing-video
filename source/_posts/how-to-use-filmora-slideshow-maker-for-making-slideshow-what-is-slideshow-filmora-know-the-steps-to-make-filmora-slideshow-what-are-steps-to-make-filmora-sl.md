## Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video

The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don't need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.

Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you're on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don't have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we've put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you'll need to know to make stunning films, even if you've never done it before. We'll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.

## **Part 1\. Edit Recorded Video in OBS**

OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It's open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.

**Step 1\. Download and Install OBS**

Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.

**Step 2\. Setup Screen Recording**

The window is divided into separate parts called "docks" when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you'll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.

![obs setup screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg)

You'll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).

**Step 3\. Customize the Recording Source**

You'll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select "Display Capture" by clicking the "+" icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click "OK". At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.

![obs customize the recording source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg)

**Step 4\. Start/Stop Recording**

You'll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you're ready to begin recording. When you're finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.

## A Detailed Guid to Remove Background From a Video in Premier Pro

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the leading video editing software. You can use to create or remove a video's background. Advanced Chroma Key features such as Color Key and Ultra Key make it possible to produce background-free content quickly.

Although both Keys work similarly, many users prefer to use the Ultra key for a better result in the video. This article will explain how to remove video background in Premiere Pro if you are a newbie.

Let's get right to it and start the tutorial!

## How to Use Premiere Pro to Remove Video Background?

Adobe Premiere Pro can remove video backgrounds quickly using the **Ultra Key** feature with the following steps:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser, and download the appropriate Adobe Premiere Pro version for your [Windows PC](https://adobe-premiere.en.softonic.com/) or [Mac](https://filehippo.com/mac/download%5Fadobe-premiere-pro-cc-for-mac/). Next, install the software on your system and launch it from your Desktop or Dock.

Step2 Now, use the **Media Browser panel** in the software to browse the video clips you want to import into the software. Next, right-click on your selected video file in which you want to remove the background and choose the **"Import"** option.

Step3 Click the **"Effects"** tab in the software panel and select Video Effects. Here, you will see the **"Keying"** option; select the **Ultra Key**, press and hold it to grab the key, and place it on your video clip.

**Note:** You can also search for the Ultra Key in the Adobe Premiere Pro search bar. Drag it to the video clip containing a background you want to remove.

Step4 As soon as you drop the Ultra Key to your footage, an **Effects Control panel** will pop up. Next, use the **eyedropper tool** in the Effects Control panel. Finally, select the background color on your video that you want to remove.

Step5 In the next step, click the drop-down menu next to the **"Output"** option, and select **"Alpha Channel"** from the list. This will reveal the details of your video and the edits. Also, click the "**Setting"** drop-down menu and select the Relaxed, Aggressive, or Custom option for the video effect.

![premiere pro output and setting<](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-output-and-setting.png)

Step6 Select the "**Matte Generation**" below Key Color. Try different levels for **Highlight**, **Shadow**, **Tolerance**, **Transparency**, **Pedestal**, and other settings to further clean the matte for a premium effect.

![premiere pro matter generation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-matter-generation.png)

Step7 In this step,choose the **"Matte Cleanup"** option to expand its settings and clean up the edges of your clip. You will see various options here, but the most important one is **"Choke."** It will shrink the object's borders and "Soften" to add fuzz.

If you see a background color spill on your video after playing with the above settings, click **"Spill Suppression"** beneath Matte Cleanup to expand its options and choose the desired settings to resolve this issue.

That's about it! You have successfully removed the video background in Premiere Pro.

Step8 In the last step, you need to save, render, and export your video with the removed background. To do this, click the **"File"** option on the Premiere Pro Media Browser, and choose **"Export"** to explore the "Media" menu.

Choose the format in the Export Settings, as it is compatible with most devices. Next, choose a valid **Preset** and **resolution**, and click "Export" to begin the rendering process. Finally, save your edited background video again, and export the video to the desired destination.

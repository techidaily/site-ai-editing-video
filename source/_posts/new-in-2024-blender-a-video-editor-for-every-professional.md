Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.

The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or ârecording timeâ (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 = RT

## Troubleshooting Problems with KMPlayer if Rotate Video Not Working

Despite the fact that you've seen that KMPlayer can rotate and edit videos, there are some disadvantages to using this particular video player. The following are some of the most frequently encountered issues when using KMPlayer to rotate video.

* After rotating a video, the video appears without a black bar, which may be irritating to some of you who are used to seeing black bars. In addition, there is no workaround for this because it is the default setting of the software.
* You may occasionally receive an error message such as "class not registered," which will cause your videos to be closed while you are watching them.
* Additionally, the screen may turn blue.
* The message "Login required" appears from time to time, which is a source of considerable irritation.
* It is also not uncommon to see that some portions of a media file are able to run while other portions of the same media file are unable to run.

## This Article Aim to Teach You How to Make a Night to Day Effect Video with Filmora. Follow the Steps to Figure It Out

Do you wish you could control when it's nighttime to daytime? It would make getting ready in the morning much faster! This tutorial will show you how to use the keyframe and mask feature in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make a remarkable night-to-day transition.

## How-to Guide

**_1) Preparation_**

For this effect, you will need to shoot two footage shots with the same frame. The first is for the daytime clip, and the second is for nighttime.

But before that, you need to prepare some things, such as:

1. Tripod to ensure your camera stays at the same point, so the frame doesn't change.
2. Mark the place where you want to shoot the scene. You can put a marker on the floor to ensure that you perform at the same spot in different shots.

Once done, let's start shooting to get the footage.

**_2) Steps_**

**Shooting footages**

First, get the daytime shot. For this tutorial, we will pretend that you are walking and transitioning into nighttime at the spot you have marked.

![get the daytime shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-1.gif)

Now, let's film the nighttime clip. You will walk through the living room and do the same movement again at the same spot. You can dim the light and change the camera's white balance settings to bluer to create a night feeling.

![film the nighttime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-2.gif)

After you have both clips that you need, let's go to Filmora and start editing.

**Night-to-day transition**

Step1 Launch Filmora and import the footage into the program. If you haven't installed it, you can download Filmora on their website here: <https://filmora.wondershare.com>

Step2 Place the nighttime video clip on the first video track of the timeline and place the daytime clip on the top.

![place the daytime clip on the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-3.jpg)

Step3 Find the spot where you want to create a transition between the day and nighttime. Then, you can delete the unwanted part.

![create a transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-4.jpg)

Step4 Since the transition for this tutorial is where the subject started waving, make sure to place the daytime clip at the same time the subject started waving in the nighttime clip. Hence, the timing in both clips syncs.

**Masking transition**

For the next step, we will make a masking transition with the Filmora mask feature.

Step1 Double-click the daytime clip on the timeline. In the Filmora setting, find the **Mask section > Circle**. You can see the mask is applied in the preview screen.

![double-click the daytime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-5.jpg)

Step2 Scroll down the setting and click add a keyframe at the beginning of the clip.

![scroll down the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-6.jpg)

Step3 Change the scale of the mask to the smallest number and adjust the Width and Height down to 0\. You can set the blur strength to 15 to make the transition edge smoother.

![change the scale of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-7.jpg)

Step4 Move the play head to find the spot where you want the mask fully opens up, then add another keyframe. Change the scale of the mask to 2 and the Width and Height to 50\. Make sure the mask occupies the whole frame.

![add another keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-8.jpg)

Now, if you play back, you can see the nighttime becomes daytime through the mask.

![nighttime becomes daytime through the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-9.gif)

If the movement in the two clips is a bit off, you can fix it by adding more keyframes on the mask.

**_3) Pro tips_**

You can add one more effect in Filmora to make it more magical. To do this, open the Effects window on the top left and find “Heartbeat” under the Basic section.

![add one more effect in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-10.jpg)

Drag and drop it onto the third video track and start the effect when the mask opens up. Then, trim the effect length to match the movement. Adjust the speed of this effect if needed.

## 7 Tips to Create Teaching Videos

For many teachers, online classes begin with a live recording of their lectures or lessons. Sending the recorded lectures to the students allows them to pause the video and rewatch it multiple times.

Recording lectures before class can assist lecturers in filling gaps that may arise due to your absence. You don't have to worry about missing lessons if you're going on vacation or to be sick for an extended time.

![create teaching video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-teaching-video.jpg)

You can keep the class continuing even if you are absent by using pre-recorded lectures and sending the file to the class, so they know the lesson. With the help of an online lecture software or tool available on the internet, you can download it free.

These are the steps in creating an instructional video in your classes:

## Know Your Target Audience

Before you record the video to present in your classes, you need to **know your target audience**. We all know that some teachers handle grade school, and some handle high school level. We need to discover what kind of knowledge or skills your students hope to gain in your class learning the topic you presented. Try to use your book, or maybe add some research and then use that information to help you discuss with your students.

![know your target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg)

Things you need to remember before you proceed to the next step:

* Who is your audience? We, educators, already know our audience. It depends on the school and what level we are going to handle. It's either grade school level or high school level.
* What is your topic/s? There are a lot of topics and subjects in the field of teaching but try to pick only one topic or subject to present to your class. For example, Computer Subject because I'm a computer teacher. I will be using this subject or topic about computers to create my instructional video for the class.
* What is the learning objective or learning outcome of your video? The learning objective of your video is the outcome that captures precisely what knowledge, skills, and attitudes the students should be able to exhibit following the instructions.
* How will your video benefit your audience? The students will learn and understand the lesson you are discussing, helping them gain knowledge of that subject to answer all the assignments, quizzes, or maybe an activity you will give them.

## Write a Script

Once you know your audience and have the topic you need, it's time to **write a script**. Think about your plan for presenting your video in your classes.

![write video script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/write-video-script.jpg)

* Here are a few more writing script tips to help you in your classes:

Go to the mirror and practice. This tip may help some teachers instead of calling their loved ones and getting feedback about the script they write.

* Explain what you're doing and why you're doing it. You are not only presenting the topic and explaining it but also showing the class what the topic is all about, which will be suitable for your students. Present some examples, pictures, or videos for them to know better what your discussion is all about.
* Knowing your script 100% is important. Make sure that you already know your script before you record. If you forget something or make a mistake, go back to the beginning and repeat it correctly. Remember as a teacher that we are not allowed to make mistakes in the eyes of the students. So, double-check everything before you record it and show it to the class.

## Record the Narration

After writing your script, let's try to **record the narration**. You don't need any application software where you can record the narration. Simply using your mobile phone and having a good background is enough.

![record narration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/record-narration.jpg)

Using a microphone to record the narration is necessary. Getting those headphones with one connected microphone is good. Some of that has noise cancellation, providing a much better sound quality while recording and ensuring that your videos don't contain background noise. Then, find a quiet place to record. Explain to your family members that no one will ever talk loud or shout while you are recording the narration.

Once you are ready to hit that record button, speak clearly. Nobody is perfect, so it's ok if you make a mistake. You don't need to start over, just pause and start again. You can remove the error or mistake by editing your finished product. Make sure your narration will be the same on the screen while recording your video.

## Record and Edit your Video

The first thing you need to do in **recording your video** is to clean up your computer screen and close all the unnecessary applications. You need to turn off also the notifications that will pop up on your computer before you start recording. You can also add your recorded narration to your video.

Here are a few simple tips for **editing your video**:

* Add some interactive elements like motions to highlight key points of your video.
* Adding music to your video is optional but may elevate a decent video to the next level. Pick something cheery. You want your audience to feel good while learning.

## The Video Duration

I'd say it's one of the first things students look at before they click the 'play' button of the video. It will benefit both teacher and the students if the video is brief and direct to the point. Some students are more likely to want a short video, or maybe let's focus on the time between 20 - 30 minutes video, where they can watch and learn on any platform, anytime. After that, you can add time by adding other pieces of information and giving activities and assignments.

## Be Yourself

Be yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes sometimes. Make sure that your personality shines throughout the video. Try to research how some teachers or maybe some speakers speak naturally and have a conversational manner with an enthusiastic tone.

When you are recording yourself talking, look right at the camera so students can feel eye contact with you, even if it is online. Sometimes we forget the words we need to say to the class, so try to prepare a note next to your webcam. The messages you prepare will help you don't look away from the camera all the time. Don't pretend to the class that you're reading something, just talk naturally as you would in real classrooms.

## Sharing your Video

Instead of sharing your recorded video with your students, you can also share it directly to online video platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo or save the video as a local file to upload on a social media platform. They can go there and watch the video. You can also upload your file to the school learning management system like Google Classroom. Please take note of this; before sending the recorded video to your students, share it with first to a few people to get some video feedback about what you created. This might help you ensure that your message is clear and that your video accomplishes your goals for your students.

There's a chance that your recorded video doesn't meet your requirements or you are not satisfied with that for the first time. Don't worry; try it again, even if you recorded it once or several times. You need to trust yourself by doing it because we are teachers; we are doing our best for the students to learn something from us.

**Benefits of loop TikTok videos**

TikTok loop includes the use of videos with a similar rhythm to create a special atmosphere that attracts people to participate and share them. The videos are made by those people who know how to make the video attractive to the public. The most used technique of communication is through a video that is shared on social networks like Facebook and Instagram.

One reason why loop TikTok videos are so popular is that they're really easy to use. You don't need to be an expert in video editing to create them. All you need is a smartphone.

## Part 2: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on a Computer

Time-lapse video is a type of video that allows you to see a huge amount of change in a very short time. You can see it on all social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. It can be used to make all kinds of videos, from simple scenes of nature to complex events. The first time-lapse video was made in France in 1872 by Léon Bouly.

There are a lot of steps to make a time-lapse video on a computer.

Step1 You need to download the free software that comes with the camera. You can find it on the manufacturer's website or through a search engine.

Step2 You'll want to plug in your phone's charging cable and plug it in so that it can stay charged while filming.

Step3 You'll need to find somewhere quiet where you can set up your camera and tripod. If possible, try to do this outside so that there's no worry about getting dust or dirt on your lens.

Step4 Set up your phone so that it will record once every hour for an hour straight. This will give you enough time for each frame of video before switching over to the next one after an hour has passed.

Step5 Start recording!

**Why we should make a time-lapse video on a computer?**

Time lapses are also useful for showing how something changes over time. For example, if you want to show how an environment changes from day to night, or how a plant grows from seedlings into mature plants after being watered and nourished by sunlight, these videos would be perfect for demonstrating this change in real-time.

You can also create time-lapse videos that show the growth of plants or flowers over time. You could use this method to demonstrate how plants grow from seedlings into fully grown trees or bushes. You could even try creating a time-lapse video showing the growth of a weed from the seedling stage into full bloom with its seeds spread out across the ground below it!

You can make your videos more fun and engaging. By recording multiple angles at the same time, you can capture all the exciting moments, like when something unexpected happens. Or when something amazing turns out to be a total disaster in real life. You can easily share with friends and family members who might not be able to come to see you in person.

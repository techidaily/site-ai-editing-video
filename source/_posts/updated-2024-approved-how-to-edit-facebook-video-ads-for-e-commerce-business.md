## Best Tips for Better Event Videography

There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional

corporate event video production. This is something that can't be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people's awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.

Let's start!

![event videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/event-videography.jpg)

## 1\. A quality corporate event video represents your business

People who are watching your corporate event video aren't just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They're also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone's phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.

You don't, but it's an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.

## 2\. A professional videographer is capable of editing

Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it's knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.

Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won't have the same

effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.

## 3\. A professional video is completed on schedule

It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or

delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.

If you're trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent

videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video

to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.

## 4\. A skilled videographer avoids interference

A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.

If you're not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you're bothering your guests and

messing up the event while you're trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as

well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don't want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.

## 5\. A video that is done well tells a story

Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story

in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in

what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It's that storyline that is going

to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.

It's also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.

## 6\. A videographer has a shot list

It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.

Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio

and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.

## Conclusion

We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special

events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and

your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the

worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won't be

many situations that you won't be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to

remain calm, cool, and professional.

![custom colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-perfectly-use-canva-color-match-3.jpg)

This **color match tool** is the most-demanded feature that has been updated on Canva. It helps choose the perfect color match very efficiently without wasting time and effort. It works like an eyedropper tool available in graphic designing software like Photoshop. It is elementary and valuable to use, and it saves a lot of time in creating attractive and wonderful designs.

It helps determine the different colors available in a particular image uploaded on the Canva app. You can easily choose the appropriate color by placing the tool in the place that has your desired color. It is a compassionate tool, so you should be very careful while choosing the color of your choice. You can press the ‘Esc’ button to exit the command without choosing any color.

This color match tool magically helps select the desired color in seconds without using any external color picker browser extension. This tool is readily available on the color pallet in the updated version of the Canva desktop app.

## Part 3 How to Use Color Match in Canva to Match Your Brand

The **color match tool** is now inbuilt in the Canva desktop app, which is very easy and convenient. You need to download the Canva desktop app to use this feature from the official website of Canva.

![canvas desktop tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-perfectly-use-canva-color-match-4.jpg)

The designers need to follow the simple steps given below to use the **color match tool** (eyedropper tool) in the updated version of the Canva desktop app:

**●** First of all, open the Canva desktop app.

**●** After this, open any design or image of your choice that you want to edit. This **color match tool** can work on any type of image, regardless of the shape and size.

**●** Now, select the particular part of the image whose color you want to change.

**●** After this, click on the color block available at the top corner to open the color customization options.

**●** A color pallet will open.

**●** On the top of the color pallet, you will see a ‘+’ (add new color) button, this button has a colorful square outline.

**●** After this, a color chart will appear under that button. You will see the color code written over there and an eyedropper tool will be available next to that color code (hex code).

**●** Click on this eyedropper tool and select the color of your choice either from the image or any other color available in Canva.

**●** After selecting the color tap on the particular part of the image whose color you want to change.

This is how you can change the color using the new color picker tool available in Canva and enjoy editing your images using the new Canva desktop app.

## Part 4 Alternative to Canva Color Match

As we all know, Canva is the most accessible online graphic designing platform used for image editing and video editing. But there are certain limitations of using it, so here we have listed some of the other graphic designing tools for both image and video editing that can be used as an alternative to the Canva app:

**●** **Visme:** It is a drag and drops editing and graphic designing tool. Using; this tool is effortless to use, and you can easily create attractive presentations, infographics, social media graphics, logos, etc. This tool can be used by anyone like students (to create their school activities), educators (to create easy to learn infographics), business people (to create attractive presentations), graphic designers (to create different content), etc.

**It contains a lot of features like:**

**●** Data Visualization Tools

**●** Variety of Professionally Designed Easy to Use Templates

**●** Infographic Maker

**●** A Large Number of Editing Tools

**●** Animation Feature with Hover Effects

**●** Analytics Feature

**●** **Adobe Spark**: It is an online tool launched by Adobe. Although it can't compete with professional software like Photoshop and Illustrator, it can be treated as the best alternative for Canva. It is used to create social media posts, logos, and graphic designs easily and efficiently. The only limitation it has is that non-designers and newcomers can’t use it without any knowledge of graphic design.

**●** **PicMonkey**: PicMonkey is another great alternative to Canva, just like Visme. It has many features that help both professional and non-professional designers create attractive and wonderful designs very easily and efficiently. It has many exciting features like photo re-toucher, pattern & effects tools, etc., just like Photoshop, but it is relatively easier to use and can be used by anyone who wants to create beautiful and creative graphic designs.

**●** ****[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**: Filmora is a video editing software and can be used as an alternative to Canva if you create and edit the videos to medium & advanced levels. It is used to create and edit short videos for social media and ad campaigns very quickly, with many features available in professional software like Adobe Premiere Pro. It is easy-to-use with an intuitive user interface that is very helpful for non-professional and less experienced video editors.

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** It can be concluded that Canva is a fantastic graphic designing tool for all the non-professionals and newcomers in the field of design. It helps people create attractive and creative designs with less effort and less time consumption.

**●** No doubt, everything has its pros and cons. Similarly, Canva also has certain limitations compared to the other professional graphic designing tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.

**●** But still, it is continuously updating and removing those limitations. For example- the new **color match tool** is introduced to this platform for easy and convenient graphic designing.

**●** This **color match tool** (eyedropper tool) was demanded by the designers who use Canva for their graphics and creating attractive social media posts, infographics, video editing, etc.

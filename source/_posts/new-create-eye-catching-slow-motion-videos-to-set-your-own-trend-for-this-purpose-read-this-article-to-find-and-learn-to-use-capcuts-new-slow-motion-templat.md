**Step 1: Get Stock Media and Place it in the Timeline**

Drag your main video in the timeline. Then, tap the "Stock Media" icon from the toolbar of the media panel. Browse one background clip and bring it to the timeline at the second track.

**Step 2: Draw a Mask to Replace the Background with Stock Media**

Look for the “Mask” option before the “AI tools” option on the right-side panel. Pick the “Draw Mask” icon and try to draw the lines around the main figure. When you finish drawing, the background will be replaced. You can use the “Blur Strength” slider to give a natural look.

## Conclusion

In short, sky replacement is a feature of Adobe Photoshop that turns clear skies into sunsets. To do so, you can follow the steps highlighted in this article. **Changing sky in the Lightroom** needs some editing skills in Photoshop, and not everyone has it. Thus, you should use Wondershare Filmora as the top-notch solution. It can change your media’s background with AI and other manual changing options.

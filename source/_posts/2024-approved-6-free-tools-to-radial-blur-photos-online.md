## How to Merge Videos in HandBrake? Expectation Vs. Reality

So you have captured some mind-blowing clips and want to join them together to make an excellent movie? But, sadly, you are still stuck because you are not sure what video editors would be suitable to complete this task fast.

If such miseries are haunting you, take a deep breath because many like you are searching for the right video merging tools. However, some people recommend using HandBrake for merging clips. So let’s dig some ground to know if the software can really combine clips. And if there’s a “Yes”? Then **how to merge videos in HandBrake**?

#### In this article

01 [What is HandBrake?](#part1)

02 [Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?](#part2)

03 [Combining Videos with Filmora Wondershare](#part3)

## Part 1: What is HandBrake?

Before you gear up for HandBrake to merge videos, it would be wise to know a few essential details about this software.

[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) is a free tool for Windows, Linux, and MAC operating systems. The basic purpose of this software is to convert videos from any format in MKV, WebM, and MP4\. It is an open-source program that allows users to convert their videos to play them on multiple devices, such as TV media players, computers, tablets, mobile phones, etc.

Moreover, this platform gives you the power to turn your low-quality videos into high-quality screen time. That is why most professional videographers use this tool to polish videos captured with old cameras.

A few more interesting features of HandBrake are:

* Combing artifacts removal due to interlacing
* Convert videos without negatively affecting the audio quality
* Volume and range adjustment
* Addition, removal, and preservation of soft subtitles

However, one vital thing to understand is that although HandBrake takes a tiny little space of your hard drive, the interface is complicated for beginners.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-1.jpeg)

## Part 2: Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?

There is a great misconception about HandBrake among the newbies that HandBrake is primarily a video merger software. But, in reality, that is not true at all. Or, at least, the latest HandBrake version 1.5.1 lacks such features.

Even the official website states that [HandBrake cannot combine](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/introduction/about.html#:~:text=does%20not%20do-,HandBrake%20does%20not%3A,video%20clips%20into%20one,-Pass-through%20video) two or more clips to make them whole.

So feel yourself lucky to read this article if you haven’t downloaded HandBrake yet. Congratulations! You are saved from another heartbreak.

But wait! If the software is not meant to merge clips, it doesn’t mean that you can’t use it to prepare your videos for the real deal. HandBrake can still be a helpful tool, permitting you to convert videos in a similar format before you start merging them on any other video editor.

For example, suppose you have two video clips in different formats. In that case, you can use HandBrake to convert all of them in a similar format so that they can be easily be merged when imported on any video merger tool.

But, again, the question is, if not HandBrake, then what?

Frankly, you will find hundreds of video editing tools with a combining clips feature, but not all of them deserve your attention and time. While software like DaVinci Resolve includes characteristics to merge two or more clips in a single shot, beginners and mid-level users may still find them a bit difficult at the start.

That is why professionals and experts prefer Filmora by Wondershare to merge videos without banging their heads on the screen.

So, how to merge videos in Filmora with simple clicks? Focus on the next part of the article to learn the step-by-step method within a few minutes.

## Part 3: Combining Videos with Filmora Wondershare

Just visit [Filmora’s website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to download the latest version of the software for your Windows or MAC.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-2.jpeg)

After downloading the software on your computer, install it. Once the software is ready, double-click the “Wondershare Filmora” icon (it should be on your desktop screen) to open the program.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-3.jpeg)

**Step 2: Import Multiple Videos in Filmora**

Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg)

Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.

As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg)

**Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline**

There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg)

It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg)

Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg)

And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.

**Step 4: Save Video on Your PC**

**Step 3\.** Next, choose the color of the rectangle shape, and to fill this select black at the Fill color swatch in the Options bar. A dialog box will appear to choose the type of fill and here you need to select the Solid Color option.

Click on the Enter button to close the dialog box.

**Step 4\.** Also, ensure that there are no strokes around the edges, and for this tap on the Stroke swatch box on the right side of the Options bar. A Stroke Type dialog box will open where you need to select the None icon. Click on Enter to close the pop-up window.

**Step 5\.** When all the above settings are done, press and hold the Shift key and then you need to click and drag the shape to move into the square box.

**Step 6\.** A newly added shape layer will now appear at the Layers panel. Now you need to make a copy of this shape and then resize it for creating the outer frame of the polaroid.

The duplicate shape layer will be created and will appear on the Layers panel. Rename these shapes as desired.

**Step 7\.** Now after selecting the border layer in the layers panel click again on the Fill color swatch and choose the White color (to make it look like a polaroid image).

**Step 8\.** Next, move to the Edit menu and select Free Transform Path which will create the transform handles around the shape which can also be used for resizing.

**Step 9\.** A shadow to the border can also be added by clicking on the icon of Layer Styles and then choosing the Drop Shadow option from the list.

**Step 10\.** Choose the image area from the Layers panel.

**Step 11\.** Next, use the Knockout function from the Blending Options.

**Step 12\.** Now select both shape layers and group the layers by clicking on New Group from Layers in the menu. Give a desired name to the group.

**Step 13\.** Next, click on the Background layer and choose New Fill or Adjustment Layer.

**Step 14\.** Tap on the Polaroid layer group from the Layers panel and select it.

**Step 15\.** Go to the Edit menu and select the Free Transform option.

**Step 16\.** Now when all the major work is done, it's time to create a duplicate layer group to create a new polaroid.

When multiple layer groups are added your **polaroid photo collage** will be ready.

## Part 3 How to Make a Photo Collage Online

## Part 4 Best Place To Get Stock Images For Your Polaroid Collage

To create an eye-catchy collage, the images added also need to be interesting. Besides your local pictures, you can even get stock images available at several sites. One such tool for stock images that we recommend is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. Though this is an advanced video editing tool supporting a wide range of functions, it also comes with a library of images and other media files that can be used.

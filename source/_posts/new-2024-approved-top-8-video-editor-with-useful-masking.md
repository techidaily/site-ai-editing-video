## What is Masking?

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage.

The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.

Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!

Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.

Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.

Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.

Masking video editing is the process of hiding or obscuring certain elements in a video clip. This can be done for aesthetic purposes and is often used to remove unwanted objects or blemishes from the footage. Masking can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.

## What is Masking?

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage. The mask is the portion of the video you've chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.

Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!

### Different types of masking

There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.

Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.

Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.

Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.

## Part1 Basic Knowledge About Different Framing

Because framing is related to capturing or focusing an object by the camera lens, it can vary depending on your desired shot. Let's start with the full-shot first and understand how it works.

### 01 Full Shot (FS)

Remember the shot of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, where all the players are focused in one wide frame? This excerpt is a practical example of what a full shot looks like. Full-shot video framing is particularly common in action or thriller movies where the creator wants to generate suspense in the audience.

As the name indicates, a full shot often emphasizes the scenery as your subject fills the frame. Like the background isn't ignored or blurred out; instead, it isn't overly stressed as well. In most cases, the camera starts with a wide-angle shot and then eventually ends with focusing on the subject.

A full-camera shot greatly emphasizes the physical presence of the character. It tracks the subject's movements, gestures, or body language, making it the focal point. As a result, the shot obtained delivers a better understanding of actions and interactions among the character and its surroundings.

### 02 Medium Shot (MS)

We often see friends in movies, going to a casino, or playing cards at a bar. What do we observe in that shot? Hand movements, facial expressions, body language, and a little context of what is happening in the background. This shot is known as the medium shot and is often called the ¾ shot.

Using the medium shot video framing technique, the camera lens allows the viewers to see the background while still focusing on the main character. It's like you will know what is happening at the back but still remain close to the character's emotions and gestures.

A medium shot usually begins by showing the subject from the knees to his face. In other cases, the shot can also start from the character's waist to the top of their head. Compared to long shots, a medium shot takes you closer to the subject's emotions.

For example, in The Princess Diary, you can see how medium-shot video framing has been useful in portraying comedic scenes. You can see Mia reaching out for plates and glasses around the tables and her eyes squinting to concentrate on the process. The medium shot captures even the smallest emotions while focusing on the background.

### 03 Close-Up (CU)

When the subject's head and face take up most of the frame, framing videos is known as a close-up shot. And a particular example of this shot can be spotted in the airport scene in "Casablanca." This scene shows how the camera lens takes various shots before ending up on the actor's face, showcasing a number of emotions and intimacy.

A close-up shot is an eye-level shot, and as a result, it takes the subject to the forefront. As a result, this shot establishes a distinct sense of connection between the audience and the character. Additionally, the environmental distraction is kept minimal throughout this shot. This setup helps maintain the emotional impact that the shot will portray.

Some of the common emotions that would be captured using close-up video framing techniques include:

* Tear-filled gaze
* Furrowed brow
* Subtle smile

Cinematographers often use such shots to intensify climaxes. These shots can be viewed as a window to the characters' souls, allowing viewers to adapt the emotions on another level.

### 04 Extreme Close-Up (XCU)

To understand the extreme close-up video framing technique, let us illustrate the movie that remained our favorite action thriller while growing up: Minority Report (2002). In this movie, the shots briefly focus on the character's eyes before hopping into the future view. This extreme close shot serves as a crucial plot to develop thematic elements in the audience.

So, an extremely close shot focuses on specific details of a character. This can be either the subject's eyes, ears, or mouth. However, the shot is not often employed casually. Instead, it is used in a stance where it is appropriate and when there is a need to develop heightened emotion among the viewers.

You can see this shot as a magnifying glass that draws attention to even the smallest emotion that would have gone unnoticed otherwise.

## Part2 Master framing types

Don't know how to master framing types? No worries, we have a comprehensive guide on that! First of all, let's start with the most basic way to frame a video:

### 01 Establishing Shots

An establishing shot is usually used to develop a context for the next upcoming scene. It is often a movie's first scene and portrays an extremely wide shot of the context. This frame on the video indicates the location and time of the scene to the audience to engage with them on a deeper level.

One of the least-known things about an establishing shot is that it doesn't require a narrative to explain what is happening. Instead, it is shot alone, and the context is shot so that the audience gets to know everything as soon as they see the excerpt.

An amazing example of establishing a shot can be seen in Stanely Kubrick's horror film, The Shining. In the movie's opening scene, the camera goes through the forest and mountains before getting onto the mountaintop hotel where the action occurs.

### 02 Single Shot

A single shot frames a video that includes a single subject or character. It occurs when a character is talking or reacting to a scenario. Here, remember that if the lens shifts focus from a subject, it is not a single shot.

In the movie Extraction 2020, you can see a single shot being utilized when the character goes on to rescue his son from the kidnappers. The shot extends a long way, including through a car crash, weapon chasing, and that iconic Hemsworth sliding off a building into a brutal fight. And the incredible part was that all of this was captured in a single shot.

### 03 Two Shot/Group Shot

As the name indicates, a two-shot or a group shot is used to frame a video that involves more than one character. It could be two people conversing or friends sitting at a cafe gossiping. This shot is particularly helpful in portraying the relationship between the characters in the frame.

A good example of two-shot video framing can be seen in the movie Silverado. During the final shooting scene, you can see two cowboys standing far apart while facing each other. Here, the two-shot technique emphasizes tension before the cowboys draw their guns.

### 04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)

OTS, or Over-the-shoulder, is the most used shot in framing videos for making movies. To understand how this shot works, let us take an example of two subjects, one named A and the other named B. Now, A is sitting right in front of subject B. Here; the shot is executed by focusing on subject A from the shoulder of subject B. The basic purpose of the shot is to fill the conversation or the meeting between the subjects.

To understand this situation better, let's take an example from the movie How to Train Your Dragon. In the scene, Hiccup is seen having a conversation with his father. Here, when Hiccup is talking, the camera is focused on him over his father's shoulder. And when his father talks, the shot is taken over the shoulder of Hiccup.

### 05 Insert Shot

Insert short framing technique uses selective focus to draw the audience's attention to the subject. Whether it be an object or merely a piece of information, insert shot has always been effective in emphasizing details.

For example, in The X-Files, an insert shot is used to provide the audience with a look at the file of Scully. This insert shot reveals the most shocking revelations in the file, including a tissue sample. Additionally, the file insert shot also shows how shady Mulder is.

### 06 POV Shot

A POV shot is used to frame a video in a way that shows what a character is doing. You can take this as a shot showing the world from the character's perspective. Our modern-day games, including Call of Duty Black Ops, are a common example of such POV shots.

The movie Friday the 13th is an iconic example of a POV shot frame on video. If you remember, the movie revolved around a killer who wasn't identified until the end. So, the audience watched the film from the killer's perspective until he was recognized.

## Conclusion

To sum it up, mastering the art of video framing, from full shots to POV shots, is an exciting journey that helps you to weave exciting stories. Understanding these techniques will empower you to craft a compelling narrative to captivate your audience, whether you are a beginner or a professional.

So, begin with framing videos now and let your work speak volumes!

In this movie, the shots briefly focus on the character's eyes before hopping into the future view. This extreme close shot serves as a crucial plot to develop thematic elements in the audience.

So, an extremely close shot focuses on specific details of a character. This can be either the subject's eyes, ears, or mouth. However, the shot is not often employed casually. Instead, it is used in a stance where it is appropriate and when there is a need to develop heightened emotion among the viewers.

You can see this shot as a magnifying glass that draws attention to even the smallest emotion that would have gone unnoticed otherwise.

## Part2 Master framing types

Don't know how to master framing types? No worries, we have a comprehensive guide on that! First of all, let's start with the most basic way to frame a video:

### 01 Establishing Shots

An establishing shot is usually used to develop a context for the next upcoming scene. It is often a movie's first scene and portrays an extremely wide shot of the context. This frame on the video indicates the location and time of the scene to the audience to engage with them on a deeper level.

One of the least-known things about an establishing shot is that it doesn't require a narrative to explain what is happening. Instead, it is shot alone, and the context is shot so that the audience gets to know everything as soon as they see the excerpt.

An amazing example of establishing a shot can be seen in Stanely Kubrick's horror film, The Shining. In the movie's opening scene, the camera goes through the forest and mountains before getting onto the mountaintop hotel where the action occurs.

### 02 Single Shot

A single shot frames a video that includes a single subject or character. It occurs when a character is talking or reacting to a scenario. Here, remember that if the lens shifts focus from a subject, it is not a single shot.

In the movie Extraction 2020, you can see a single shot being utilized when the character goes on to rescue his son from the kidnappers. The shot extends a long way, including through a car crash, weapon chasing, and that iconic Hemsworth sliding off a building into a brutal fight. And the incredible part was that all of this was captured in a single shot.

### 03 Two Shot/Group Shot

As the name indicates, a two-shot or a group shot is used to frame a video that involves more than one character. It could be two people conversing or friends sitting at a cafe gossiping. This shot is particularly helpful in portraying the relationship between the characters in the frame.

A good example of two-shot video framing can be seen in the movie Silverado. During the final shooting scene, you can see two cowboys standing far apart while facing each other. Here, the two-shot technique emphasizes tension before the cowboys draw their guns.

### 04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)

OTS, or Over-the-shoulder, is the most used shot in framing videos for making movies. To understand how this shot works, let us take an example of two subjects, one named A and the other named B. Now, A is sitting right in front of subject B. Here; the shot is executed by focusing on subject A from the shoulder of subject B. The basic purpose of the shot is to fill the conversation or the meeting between the subjects.

To understand this situation better, let's take an example from the movie How to Train Your Dragon. In the scene, Hiccup is seen having a conversation with his father. Here, when Hiccup is talking, the camera is focused on him over his father's shoulder. And when his father talks, the shot is taken over the shoulder of Hiccup.

### 05 Insert Shot

Insert short framing technique uses selective focus to draw the audience's attention to the subject. Whether it be an object or merely a piece of information, insert shot has always been effective in emphasizing details.

For example, in The X-Files, an insert shot is used to provide the audience with a look at the file of Scully. This insert shot reveals the most shocking revelations in the file, including a tissue sample. Additionally, the file insert shot also shows how shady Mulder is.

### 06 POV Shot

A POV shot is used to frame a video in a way that shows what a character is doing. You can take this as a shot showing the world from the character's perspective. Our modern-day games, including Call of Duty Black Ops, are a common example of such POV shots.

The movie Friday the 13th is an iconic example of a POV shot frame on video. If you remember, the movie revolved around a killer who wasn't identified until the end. So, the audience watched the film from the killer's perspective until he was recognized.

## Conclusion

To sum it up, mastering the art of video framing, from full shots to POV shots, is an exciting journey that helps you to weave exciting stories. Understanding these techniques will empower you to craft a compelling narrative to captivate your audience, whether you are a beginner or a professional.

So, begin with framing videos now and let your work speak volumes!

## What You Should Know About Speech-to-Text  Technology

Speech-to-text technology (**STT**) improves communication, especially in a multi-language setting. One of the ways we practice multilingualism is via **speech-to-text technology:** speakers input a language, and viewers read another language. Other advantages include converting oral speech into a document, real-time compatibility, and offline usage. This article explains how you can utilize **speech-to-text assistance** technology for optimal productivity.

![speech to text technology](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology.jpg)

## Part 1: What is speech-to-text technology?

Speech-to-text technology (STT) identifies oral pronunciation and converts them into computer codes: electronic words. The computer electro-communication requires a medium of conversion: receiver and interpreter. Therefore, speech-to-text technology contains both the receiver and interpreter, which exist electronically. The medium or receiver can be software installed on a device; it must have a receiver and a screen. The computer serves a good purpose, although other devices can receive words without displaying them.

A speech-to-text technology does not necessarily have to contain displaying screen: a sound interpreter may replace the screen. Thus, speech-to-text can be oral words - electronic recognition - word encoding - display, or recitation. Oral wordings are the human's contribution to speech-to-text technology, although all communication (especially speech) may be generated from a computer. Inter-device communication is another advancement of speech-to-text technology. For example, combining one or more devices allow you to use speech-to-text assistance technology in different languages.

Communication is the paramount importance in speech-to-text technology. Still, some advantages include easy data conversion, documentation, workflow flexibility, and easy access to data. For example, documentation is incomplete if every human cannot access the file. All humans cannot read; improvising data into oral documents reduces the percentage of people who cannot access the file. Speech-to-text increases the channel for less privileged individuals. For instance, the deaf who cannot listen to a recorded file can read the file via speech-to-text technology.

Speech-to-text technology incorporates many advantages. Learning to use the technology is the first step in familiarizing and getting yourself equipped.

## Part 2: What are the stages for the technology?

STT gives so many stages and applications for a daily and smooth organization. Some include:

### 1\. Education

Education and the love to study other languages increase with speech-to-text technology. The educative application is not limited to four corners of the room; it extends to all daily learning activities. Communication is educative if you learn new things via communication.

STT improves all processes associated with less privileged education. For example, everyone easily pours their mind into a computer screen page when they speak, especially in the language they understand using STT. Time and submission date are important factors in the educational system; STT improves time, submission, accuracy, and authentication.

### 2\. Video Subtitles

Videography and filmmaking carry a large percentage of today's media. Data input and integration in the video-making process weigh a lot, and the concept of STT reduces the load on the data specialist. Instead of long hours of typing, oral communication is applicable. Processing time is a factor of productivity; STTs do not only affect the time of production but also maintain accuracy.

### 3\. Chatbots

Chatbots are available on websites. Users have different preferences: some can type while others like to communicate via speech. The chatbots attend to users' needs; you can do more with STT if installed on the website. STT promotes freedom of communication and increases user interaction on your website. STT may be incorporated into mobile applications too. There is more to STT, and the advantage is unlimited if you add it to your chatbots.

### 4\. Translation

Translation is the interconversion of languages. The main reason translation is important is because communication is essential; without communication, production will be static. STT is among the tool that elevates productivity via communication. For example, STT improves communication in a situation where more than one language combines as one.

## Part 3: What are the best STT Technology provider

### 1\. Amazon web services

STT is one of the services in the Amazon web services. The STT is available for all users who subscribe to one or more Amazon services. Some features include unlimited conversion, easy download, and availability in multiple formats. To get started, you need to sign up for a free AWS account and begin to enjoy the offer. Although the services are available for all users, limitations, and upgrades come a few times when you must pay for certain premium services.

![amazon web services](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology-3.jpg)

### 2\. Google docs voice typing

Google docs voice typing is available for all Google users. You can access the Google docs voice typing provided you are on a service by Google. The service is available on the Google docs application - one of the services created by Google. Google docs are free for download and available for desktop and mobile users.

### 3\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora STT is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms/stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.

### 4\. Microsoft dictate

The Microsoft dictate shows to have the same build-up as the Microsoft Cortana Virtual Assistant. It gives free access to all users who convert speech-to-text without subscribing to any platform. The Microsoft dictate is a default option for many Microsoft devices and partners' software. Microsoft dictates accuracy is appreciable; it is likewise easy to use.

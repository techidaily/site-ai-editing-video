## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

They enliven the proceedings and contribute to the fun and memorability of your Zoom meetings.

Your films' colors may be changed, and video filters can also add new aspects. By selecting a filter appropriate for each event, like team meetings or game nights, you may create the right atmosphere. You may embellish your face in the video with flowers or animal traits by using Zoom's various filters. Alternately, you might just convert your video's color to black and white. The video filters from a different program, however, allow you to apply more vibrant filters and place a greater emphasis on special effects.

### 3\. Lighting and Touch-ups

The Lighting function enhances lighting effects and makes adjustments for low light situations to make you seem more professional during a Zoom conference. Similar to this, Touch-up enhances your facial characteristics by making your skin shine, erasing wrinkles, and giving your face a radiant appearance.

On your Zoom videos, changing your lighting and applying touch-ups may improve how you seem. By adjusting your lighting, you can make even dim illumination look bright. By doing touch-ups, you may get a smoother skin texture and get rid of any obvious imperfections.

### 4\. Studio Effects

Zoom has been developing on a new feature called Studio Effects that would give customers the option of using virtual cosmetics in their movies. They are still checking it out before formally releasing it since it is still in beta. However, it is still available to users under the Backgrounds & Filters area. You may adjust the opacity as you like. You have the option to choose a new color or one of the predefined colors. Additionally, you may decide to employ the face effects in all of your next meetings, albeit doing so might be problematic if you use Zoom for business. Don't worry if you're running late. Zoom can give your face a natural-looking cosmetic makeover in only one minute!

This function is intended for less formal settings, such as gatherings of friends or family. Anyone who wants to seem more professional during meetings has access to Studio Effects, which offers the choice of various eyebrow colors, beards, and lipsticks. These are a few recently added features. You may add mustaches, beards, and brows in a variety of designs, hues, and intensities. Additionally, you have the option of coloring your lips.

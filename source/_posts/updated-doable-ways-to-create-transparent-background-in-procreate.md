* You may occasionally receive an error message such as "class not registered," which will cause your videos to be closed while you are watching them.
* Additionally, the screen may turn blue.
* The message "Login required" appears from time to time, which is a source of considerable irritation.
* It is also not uncommon to see that some portions of a media file are able to run while other portions of the same media file are unable to run.

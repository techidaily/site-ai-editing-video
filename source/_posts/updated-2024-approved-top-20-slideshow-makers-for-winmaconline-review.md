## Here Is a Step-by-Step Guide to Color Correct and Color Grade a Video Professionally with Wondershare Filmora. Let’s Get Going

As a post-production analysis of the filmed video, you might have noticed how the color contrast in a real VS reel. The colors do not appear bright and robust on a screen as in real life.

While there are numerous reasons for the dull, uninviting look- a basic edit could fix it quickly. One of the vital, if not the first, steps in the process is color grading and color correction. However, what exactly are color grading and color correction? And how can they help fix the color ratios and balance in a video?

This article covers everything you need to know about color grading and correction and a complete guide to adjusting cinematic colors with the best video editor, Wondershare Filmora. So, without much ado, let's dig into it!

## Part 1\. Color Grading VS Color Correction

These terms have often been used interchangeably; people consider them synonymous. However, they are two different artistic phenomena to adjust the color scheme.

Since we will discuss them in detail later, here is a brief description. Put simply, color correcting is a corrective procedure, while color grading is a cinematic adjustment.

Color correction diverts the colors to a relatively neutral baseline achieving a unified look for all captured shots. On the other hand, color grading is inclined more toward a creative look aimed at balancing colors that reflect the emotion of the sequence.

![color correction vs color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/color-correction-vs-color-grading.gif)

These two work hand in hand to dramatically uplift the overall look of the sequence. Let's delve deeper into these techniques and see how to use them.

## Part 2\. What Is Color Correction?

We will start with color correction- the first step in color editing. Even with a slight glance at the raw shots, you can notice how much the tones are messed up. The crude product is oversaturated with colors.

Color correction is about making the shots look as natural as possible. It brings the sequences to the neutral baseline to achieve a unified look.

For now, we need to ignore our creative and aesthetic preferences and focus entirely on exposure and white balance. The actual end goal is to keep the colors true to life.

However, color-correcting a video is challenging if you are a beginner. There needs to be more than just understanding the fundamentals; it requires cinematic and technical skills.

Here is the basic process for a clean, color-corrected shot, irrespective of the software you use.

### Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot

##### 1\. Set the color profile

Different video formats (HDR, LOG, RAW, HLG, etc.) have different exposure content. Therefore, select a color profile that matches your video format for the best results before starting.

##### 2\. Adjust the saturation

It is the primary step of color correction. Often the exposure of raw content is high. Next, equalize the saturation for a natural look.

##### 3\. Fix the contrast

Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas of the image. Pictures with a higher contrast are sharper and more detailed.

However, adjust the contrast during color correcting so that the dark areas are not crushed, and you preserve the details maximally.

##### 4\. Set the white balance

It is time to adjust the white balance with the saturation and contrast fixed. The colors will shift to orange and blue hues if it is maladjusted.

Use the color curves to ensure pure whites so all colors fall correctly in place.

##### 5\. Double-check individual color tones

The final step is a secondary checking of the individual colors. Double-check the skin tones so they match in each shot.

Make sure the skin tones match their natural hues for an authentic, unfiltered look.

It is a basic walkthrough for color-correcting. More steps can vary according to the professional demands of the video. However, as a beginner, this is the best process to follow.

Once we've corrected the color, it is time to move to the next and primary step- color grading.

## Part 3\. What Is Color Grading?

After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.

Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.

### Basic Steps of Color Grading

If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.

##### 1\. Color correcting

Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.

##### 2\. Match the colors

In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.

##### 3\. Shot-to-shot matching

The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.

##### 4\. Adjust the mood and emotions

A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director's feelings in the video.

##### 5\. Make the final adjustments

As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.

If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.

However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do's and Not To-do's in the post-production edit.

## Part 4\. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment

Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.

##### 1\. Neutral editing environment

Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.

Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90\. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.

##### 2\. Using might shifts/orange screen

People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.

Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.

##### 3\. Control the light

It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.

Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.

After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let's demonstrate how to do it in real-time.

Choosing good software can be chaos. There are plenty of options in the market with the best features, but we will be using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Read on for a step-by-step guide on color correcting and grading.

## Part 3\. What Is Color Grading?

After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.

Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.

### Basic Steps of Color Grading

If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.

##### 1\. Color correcting

Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.

##### 2\. Match the colors

In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.

##### 3\. Shot-to-shot matching

The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.

##### 4\. Adjust the mood and emotions

A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director's feelings in the video.

##### 5\. Make the final adjustments

As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.

If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.

However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do's and Not To-do's in the post-production edit.

## Part 4\. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment

Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.

##### 1\. Neutral editing environment

Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.

Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90\. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.

##### 2\. Using might shifts/orange screen

People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.

Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.

##### 3\. Control the light

It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.

Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.

After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let's demonstrate how to do it in real-time.

Choosing good software can be chaos. There are plenty of options in the market with the best features, but we will be using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Read on for a step-by-step guide on color correcting and grading.

## Consider a LUT to Be a Color Preset that a Filmmaker Can Use to Start Working on a Project Quickly. Sony Engineers Have Developed LUTs to Help Filmmakers Perform Specific Tasks. All of These Are Available for Free

If you've ever worked in the color grading profession, you're aware of how time-consuming and labor-intensive it is to achieve a specific look on a scene. To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.

Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image's colors.

## Benefits of using LUTs

There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We've already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.

### 1\. A beginning towards professionalism

This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.

You'll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You'll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.

However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.

### 2\. It saves your time

Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn't the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.

However, there's a good probability that it won't look the same in all of the images. This is where you'll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It's nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.

### 3\. Work on a budget

Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I'm sure we've all done at some point.

Whether it's a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.

### 4\. It provides an artistic approach

LUTs are beneficial because they allow videos shot with cameras that shoot very dark, discolored images to have more vivid tones and contrast. This is excellent for grabbing viewers' attention and making videos more intriguing and engaging. LUTs add an artistic element to videos and can help you develop a visual artistic identity for your videos if you use the same colors. Another advantage of LUTs is that they enhance the color quality of videos shot on smartphones with particular color schemes. Although this varies significantly from brand to brand, you can use LUTs to make a Smartphone video more vibrant and appealing.

**●** There are a lot of transitions and filters to make the slideshow look amazing.

**●** There are various text templates to help you annotate more effectively.

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

**Step 5**: Incorporating Motion Graphics Elements into Slides

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

The final step in the process of creating a slideshow in Filmora is to export the project. Click on the **Export** button and wait for the **Export window** to appear on the screen. You can then select the output file format, set a preferred frame rate or resolution for your slideshow, or export

**●** There are various text templates to help you annotate more effectively.

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

**Step 5**: Incorporating Motion Graphics Elements into Slides

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

The final step in the process of creating a slideshow in Filmora is to export the project. Click on the **Export** button and wait for the **Export window** to appear on the screen. You can then select the output file format, set a preferred frame rate or resolution for your slideshow, or export

## **FAQs about Resizing FLV Video**

Here are some of the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to resizing FLV videos that you might be interested in:

1. **How do I make FLV files smaller?**

You can make FLV files smaller with the help of any video editor that supports Flv video format by cutting and cropping out unnecessary parts, decreasing the resolution, and bitrate, and converting flv into another lighter file format.

1. **Which video editors support FLV file format?**

There are few video editors like Filmora, Movavi, VSDC, etc. that support the FLV file format. But when it comes to editing FLV videos, Filmora Video Editor is the best choice.

1. **How do I view an FLV file?**

FLV is one of the oldest video formats due to which most new and modern video players don’t recognize it or can’t play it. However, there are few programs like VLC media players which can help you view an FLV file. Or you can also convert the FLV file into other supported video formats with the help of a video converter.

1. **Can I convert a horizontal FLV video into a vertical one?**

Yes, and that’s a piece of cake when you use Filmora Video Editor or other similar video editors. You just need to change the aspect ratio of the video or the project from horizontal (generally 16:9) to vertical (generally 9:16).

1. **Can I resize FLV video files on my mobile?**

Though video editors on mobile are not as powerful as those on PC, there are some that are still capable enough to let you easily resize FLV video files on mobile devices. Some examples are Splice, Powerdirector, etc.

## Steps To Fade Audio In Premier Pro

Audio is a very big part of any video project and it can make or break the video project. This is why it is very important to not just choose a video editor that also offers audio editing, but one that is easy to use and offers a lot of editing options. This way, you can edit the audio in your project to suit your video's production and end up with a great professional final product.

One of the video editing tools that offer features that can accomplish all that is Adobe Premier Pro. In this article, we will look at how you can use Premier Pro to fade audio in or out.

## Steps to Fade Audio in Premier Pro

Premier Pro gives you two different options to fade audio in or out. Let's look at both options and then you can choose the one that suits you best;

### Fade Audio using Crossfade Audio Transition

Step1To begin, open Premier Pro on your computer and then open the audio that you want to edit.

Step2Once it is open, select the audio clip in the timeline and then click on “Sequence” at the top menu and select “Apply Audio Transition.”

You can also use the keyboard shortcut Shift + Command + D (macOS) or Shift+ Ctrl + D (PC). This will add the “Constant Power Cross Fade” effect at the beginning and the end of the clip.

Step3You can then just change the duration of the effect by simply dragging the end of the transition.

### Fade Audio using Clip Keyframes

Step1Adobe Premier Pro has two volume keyframes; Track and Clip. Make the audio larger so you can see the volume line and then under the audio name, click on the volume keyframes option to make sure “Clip Keyframes” is enabled.

Step2You can then press down on the Command Key (macOS) or the Control Key (PC) and drag the volume line down to add a fade-in or fade-out effect.

## Adobe Premiere Alternative Way to Fade Audio

If you are like most people and you find Adobe Premier Pro to be very difficult you use, we have a tool that is just as effective but also simplifies the process. This is the very simple to use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Just like Premier Pro, Filmora gives you two options to fade audio in and out. Let's look at both options;

**Adding Fade in and Out in Audio Pane**

Step1Download and install Wondershare Filmora onto your computer, open the program and then import the audio clip that you want to edit.

Step2Once the video has been added to the timeline, double-click on it to access the “Audio” editing panel.

Step3Here, you can very simply add the fade-in and fade-out effects by simply dragging the sliders to the desired duration or by manually entering the duration in seconds.

**Using the Audio Waveform**

You can also use the fade icons on the left and right edges of the audio waveform to quickly add a fade in and out.

To add a fade-in effect, drag the fade-in maker to the right. Then go to the end of the clip to drag the fade-out maker to the left to add a fade-out effect.

## Related FAQs about Audio Fade

### 1\. How Do I Fade to Black in Adobe Premiere Pro?

You can easily add the Fade to Black transition in Adobe Premiere Pro using the “Effects” tab. Just open the two clips in Premiere Pro and go to “Effects.” Type in “dip to black” in the search box and when you find the effect, drag it between the two clips in the timeline. The effect will appear on the right side of the project.

You also have several customization options that you can apply to the effect to get it just right. To see these options, go to Effect Controls and you should be able to change the alignment of the effect to “Center at Cut” so that the first video fades out to black before the second video appears.

### 2\. Premiere Pro Audio Fade Not Working?

Sometimes you can complete all the editing steps we have described above but you are unable to tell if the fade-in and fade-out effects are working because you can't play the audio in Premiere. This is a very common problem that can easily be fixed using the following troubleshooting steps;

Check the master volume on your computer to see if this is the problem

Then check the volume in Premiere to see if the audio meter is moving as you play the clip. It is the green bar usually in the lower right corner.

If your volume is fine but you still can't hear the audio, you may need to adjust several settings. Go to Edit > Preferences (on PC) or Preferences menu under the main Premiere Pro CC menu (macOS) and select “Audio Hardware” in the options that appear. You can then change the “Default Output” device to something else.

### 3\. How Do You do Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro

Adding audio transitions in Premiere Pro is very easy; just open the audio that you want to edit and then Right-click (PC) or Control- Click (macOS) on either the “Constant Gain” or “Constant Power” effect from the Effects panel. Then choose “Set Selected as Default Transition” from the options in the menu.

To add a duration for the audio transitions, go to Edit > Preferences > Timeline (PC) or Premiere Pro Menu > Preferences (macOS) and enter the duration value under “Audio Transition Default Duration.”

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

S-Log is a gamma curve optimized for digital cameras to maximize the image sensor's performance. Although these videos may look flat and washed out, they contain lots of color information. Even better, video creators can use color correction to edit the S-Log videos and make them look as natural as possible. That's what this article is all about.

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

This tutorial assumes that you already have an S-Log footage. If not, you can record S-Log footage using most Canon, Sony, and Panasonic cameras.

![how to color-correct an s-log footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/record-s-log-footage.gif)

Let's get to the steps!

##### Step1 Adjust the color settings

Start by adding your video to the timeline on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then double-click the video track. Then, click on the **Color** tab before tapping **Advanced**.

![adjust the color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-1.jpg)

##### Step2 Read and study the histogram

Now you'll see the Advanced Color Correction pop-up window. Here, you'll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.

![read and study the histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Adjust the image colors

Once you've understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.

![adjust the image colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif)

After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the **Light** section, then adjust the **Highlights** to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn't look pure white, increase the **Whites** slide to make it whiter.

![go to the light section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg)

Now adjust the **Shadows** settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the **Blacks** slider to the left.

**Pro tip**: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don't cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.

##### Step4 Adjust the color saturation

Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the **Color** section and adjust the **Saturation** slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the **Vibrance** to make your video objects look more colorful.

![adjust the color saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg)

##### Step5 Preview and compare the video

Now it's time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the **Eye** icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the **AB** icon and choose **Split View-Left/Right** to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.

**Adobe Premiere**

Best For: Animators, professional cartoonists, and marketers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Adobe Premiere is a video editing program that can be used to create and edit all types of video projects including AMVs. It has numerous features that can make it very easy to come up with the most professional video that you want to create. Because of these very many, but very useful features, using Adobe Premiere can be difficult at first. But once you gate a hang of it, it is one of the best ways to create any video including AMVs.

Adobe Premiere can be used on both Mac and Windows operating systems and it is compatible with most video and audio formats. But like most Adobe software it is not a free solution. You do get a 7-day free trial that you can use without limitation, but you will need to pay a subscription fee to continue using it.

**Apple iMovie**

Best For: Marketers, freelancers, YouTubers, Bloggers

Supported OS: Mac

![apple imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-interface.jpg)

It has all the basic video editing features that you need for a project of this magnitude including the ability to merge videos and apply filters.

This makes it the most ideal tool for creating AMVs since you typically need to break a file into various sections for your AMV. You can then add audio to the video and choose one of the effects and filters to add to it. Once the video is complete, you can then export it in 4K resolution or upload it to YouTube directly.

**Sony Vegas**

Best For: Animators, Marketers, Video Editors and Bloggers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![sony vegas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

Sony Vegas comes with a universal editor that allows you to create your video using the multi-cam editing feature or crossfades. You can also add various effects to the video including various colors and other special effects. But as you can probably guess, Sony Vegas may be a bit complicated for the beginner user, although there are numerous tutorials to help you through this process.

**Final Cut Pro**

Best For: Marketers, Animators, YouTubers, Freelancers, and Professional video editors

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-cut-pro.jpg)

It also has over 100 different transitions and more than 149 different visual effects to create your video any way you want to.

But perhaps the best feature that Final Cut Pro has when it comes to creating and editing AMV videos is the ability to organize and crop videos easily. The “Compounding Clips” feature, in particular, will come in handy when combining footage, soundtracks, and effects into one perfect AMV.

**Lightworks**

Best For: YouTubers, Freelancers, Bloggers, and Marketers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

The drag and drop interface makes it the most ideal solution even for beginners and it offers a lot of options for designing and customizing the videos. One other major benefit of choosing Lightworks is that it does come with a free version that is not as limited as you would expect.

The timeline is easy to use, allowing you to create AMVs from scratch or merge clips to create the video. You can also use numerous effects on the video and even add music to the video.

**Windows Movie Maker**

Best For: Freelancers, bloggers, marketers, and YouTubers

Supported OS: Windows

![windows movie maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker.png)

Windows Movie Maker is one of the most popular video editing tools on the Windows OS and it has all the necessary editing features that you will need when you want to create AMV videos. On this free video editing tool, you can cut, split and crop the video or even add audio files and subtitles as needed,

It can work with numerous video and image formats, offering a wide range of options when it comes to video editing. Some of the functions that you can expect to use include video trimming, which can easily be done by simply dragging the slider to the desired location. But you will find that Windows Movie Maker lacks some of the features that can make your AMVs truly stand out.

## Related FAQs

1.Is Making AMV illegal?

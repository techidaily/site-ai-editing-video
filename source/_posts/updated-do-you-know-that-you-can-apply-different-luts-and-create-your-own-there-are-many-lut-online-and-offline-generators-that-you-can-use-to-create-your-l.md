## How to Make a Bokeh Effect

There's a strong chance you've heard about bokeh before if you frequently visit photography websites or have friends who are photographers. What exactly is this optical effect that camera aficionados frequently discuss? Bokeh, who is derived from the Japanese word for "blur," is a term used in photography to describe how a lens presents an out-of-focus background.

1. [Paintshop Pro](#part4-1)
2. [Blur n Bokeh](#part4-2)
3. [PhotoDirector](#part4-3)
4. [Tadaa SLR](#part4-4)

## Part 1\. What is a Bokeh Effect?

The Japanese word boke, which meaning "blur," "haze," or "boke-aji," the "blur quality," is where the term "bokeh" originates. The pronunciation of bokeh is BOH-K or BOH-kay. You can find a lot of people discussing the beautiful bokeh that their favorite fast lenses allow on any photography website or forum.

Bokeh is characterized by the words "smooth," "amazing," "superb," "good," "beautiful," "sweet," "silky," and "great." But what is it exactly? When using a fast lens and the widest aperture possible, such as f/2.8 or wider, you can create bokeh, which is described as "the effect of a fuzzy out-of-focus background." Bokeh is the appealing or aesthetically pleasant aspect of out-of-focus blur in a shot, to put it simply.

## Part 2\. What is a Bokeh effect used for?

Most often, bokeh is employed for artistic purposes. You might occasionally desire a little background blur so that the viewer's attention is drawn to the subject. In other cases, you can want it to completely detract from the subject, as in portraiture when you want to concentrate on the individual's eyes or mouth while blurring the rest of the image. It's true that some people use bokeh inadvertently, like looking for photos with excellent bokeh that they may use as free images on their websites or blogs. This isn't advised, though, as it's against the law and usually frowned upon in the photographic community as a whole to steal someone else's image in this manner.

## Part 3\. How do you create a Bokeh effect?

Bokeh's smooth, organic texture is among its most lovely features. The major goal in producing this effect is to distinguish the subject from the backdrop by employing a shallow depth of field. You will learn how to create beautiful bokeh for your photos in this video. One of the most alluring photographic effects, particularly for portraits, is bokeh. It can impart a sense of perfection to everything in a photo, making it look lot more appealing and engaging. Bokeh helps to create a dreamy backdrop that gives the image a whole new level of depth and perspective.

Using a camera lens with a shallow depth of focus is one of the many methods for achieving bokeh in photography. You need a short depth of field so that your lens aperture can be opened up as wide as possible to achieve beautiful bokeh. You can take pictures with shallow depth of field, often known as bokeh, with a point and shoot or a DSLR. A common photography technique used to make the subject stand out from the backdrop is called bokeh.

It can be used to draw attention to the topic by blurring or losing focus on the background. Three different kinds of lenses can create beautiful bokeh: prime lenses with a wide aperture The best lenses for bokeh are often wide-aperture prime lenses. Although they are frequently more expensive and heavier than zoom lenses, they offer a wider field of view. Since there is a greater difference in depth between the foreground and background when using a wide-open aperture, wide aperture prime lenses make blurring the background easier.

## Part 4\. What software do you need for a Bokeh effect?

Bokeh is one of the best techniques for creating a soft out-of-focus background and emphasizing a certain spot in a shot. Utilizing a fast lens and modifying the camera's aperture settings are the typical methods for obtaining bokeh. Still, using software for both Windows and Mac, even amateur photographers may enhance their photographs with a fantastic bokeh effect.

It might be challenging to determine which photo editing software is ideal for producing high-quality bokeh effects without trying them all out, which isn't always an option. The top five Bokeh Effect Makers will be discussed in this post in order to improve your photographs' visual appeal and set them apart from the competition.

### \# Paintshop Pro

With a comprehensive toolkit created for users of all ability levels, Paintshop Pro enables you to edit, enhance, and repair your photos. A touch-friendly photography option with a distinctive split-screen before-and-after function was recently added to the software. Paintshop Pro is a good option if you're searching for a reasonably priced photo editor that lets you tack on extra premium capabilities as you go.

Depending on your degree of competence, the software offers three distinct workspaces for you to choose from. Essential editing tools and cutting-edge technologies like AI Upsampling and AI Style Transfer can be found in the Photography Workspace, which is intended for beginners or those making short alterations.

All of the common editing and retouching tools are present in the Essentials Workspace, but only a limited number of tools and palettes are visible. You may also change the available settings to display or hide the controls you need. Last but not least, Paintshop Pro's Complete Workspace shows all of its tools and features.

### \# Blur n Bokeh

The focus of Blur & Bokeh for Mac is blurring an image's backdrop and foreground. It has the ability to boost the saturation, brightness, and warmth of the highlighted areas, as well as masking with edge detection. The clever edge-preserving method is one of the software's strongest components. It offers excellent outcomes for creating realistic-looking image output.

You may modify the foreground and background of your photographs using a variety of filters. Although Blur n Bokeh is excellent at producing bokeh, it's not the ideal choice if you're searching for software that provides a variety of additional picture editing features.

### \# PhotoDirector

All skill levels will benefit greatly from using PhotoDirector, a complete photo editor that is free to download and simple to use. Express Mode, who is great for making quick edits, or Full Mode, which offers preset and manual photo alteration options along with creative effects, overlays, and beauty options, are two ways the program lets you access the editor.

The best part is that there is a special bokeh tool that lets you add bokeh lights and blur a specific section of an image with just one click. PhotoDirector employs an image's natural light sources to create the bokeh effects, in contrast to other tools. Having said that, you may select a shape from 25 options and even enable live animation.

Both beginning and experienced photographers will find PhotoDirector to be a desirable alternative. PhotoDirector is unquestionably at the top of the list if you're seeking for reliable post-processing software with a large range of features.

### \# Tadaa SLR

Although there are many amazing things about your iPhone, its camera will never be able to take pictures with the same wonderfully shallow depth of field as your DSLR. That will always be the case unless Apple manages to get a much, much larger sensor into the phone.

Software, however, may mimic that lavish, shallow depth of field appearance. Tadaa SLR accomplishes this. Actually, Tadaa allows you to alter the photo's focus point in addition to artificially adjusting the depth of field. Similar to what you can accomplish with the cutting-edge Lytro camera, it does it after you take the picture.

Tadaa is launched in camera mode, and you compose and snap your picture. Alternately, you can pick a picture from your camera roll if you wish to start with an existing image. A few widgets are as follows: Switch between a square or wide shot, show a line of thirds grid, and turn the flash on and off. Even access to the front and back cameras is provided by Tadaa.

## Conclusion

Many popular photo editing programs require intermediate-level photo editing knowledge and can be a bit on the expensive side, but there are a few programs out there that cater to all skill levels and have free versions

that don’t cut corners on quality.

While each photo editor comes with various pros and cons, only one strikes a balance between offering a wide range of editing tools and being easy to navigate, and that’s PhotoDirector.

All of the common editing and retouching tools are present in the Essentials Workspace, but only a limited number of tools and palettes are visible. You may also change the available settings to display or hide the controls you need. Last but not least, Paintshop Pro's Complete Workspace shows all of its tools and features.

### \# Blur n Bokeh

The focus of Blur & Bokeh for Mac is blurring an image's backdrop and foreground. It has the ability to boost the saturation, brightness, and warmth of the highlighted areas, as well as masking with edge detection. The clever edge-preserving method is one of the software's strongest components. It offers excellent outcomes for creating realistic-looking image output.

You may modify the foreground and background of your photographs using a variety of filters. Although Blur n Bokeh is excellent at producing bokeh, it's not the ideal choice if you're searching for software that provides a variety of additional picture editing features.

### \# PhotoDirector

All skill levels will benefit greatly from using PhotoDirector, a complete photo editor that is free to download and simple to use. Express Mode, who is great for making quick edits, or Full Mode, which offers preset and manual photo alteration options along with creative effects, overlays, and beauty options, are two ways the program lets you access the editor.

The best part is that there is a special bokeh tool that lets you add bokeh lights and blur a specific section of an image with just one click. PhotoDirector employs an image's natural light sources to create the bokeh effects, in contrast to other tools. Having said that, you may select a shape from 25 options and even enable live animation.

Both beginning and experienced photographers will find PhotoDirector to be a desirable alternative. PhotoDirector is unquestionably at the top of the list if you're seeking for reliable post-processing software with a large range of features.

### \# Tadaa SLR

Although there are many amazing things about your iPhone, its camera will never be able to take pictures with the same wonderfully shallow depth of field as your DSLR. That will always be the case unless Apple manages to get a much, much larger sensor into the phone.

Software, however, may mimic that lavish, shallow depth of field appearance. Tadaa SLR accomplishes this. Actually, Tadaa allows you to alter the photo's focus point in addition to artificially adjusting the depth of field. Similar to what you can accomplish with the cutting-edge Lytro camera, it does it after you take the picture.

Tadaa is launched in camera mode, and you compose and snap your picture. Alternately, you can pick a picture from your camera roll if you wish to start with an existing image. A few widgets are as follows: Switch between a square or wide shot, show a line of thirds grid, and turn the flash on and off. Even access to the front and back cameras is provided by Tadaa.

## Conclusion

Many popular photo editing programs require intermediate-level photo editing knowledge and can be a bit on the expensive side, but there are a few programs out there that cater to all skill levels and have free versions

that don’t cut corners on quality.

While each photo editor comes with various pros and cons, only one strikes a balance between offering a wide range of editing tools and being easy to navigate, and that’s PhotoDirector.

## Ideas for Time-Lapse Video

Are you thinking of stepping out of the familiar world of still photography to make a time-lapse video?

As you all know I am a fan of travel videos and time-lapse video because why not? There is no denying that time-lapse techniques are a perfect medium for travel videos.

In this article will give you some ideas to get started in time-lapse video or photography and let's define what a time-lapse video and what makes them great.

## What is Time Lapse

Time-lapse is a creative filming and video editing technique that manipulates how the frame rate is captured. Frame rate is the number of images or frames appearing in a second of video. In most videos, the frame rate and playback speed are the same. In a time-lapse video, the frame rate is stretched out far more: when played back at average speed, time appears to be sped up.

Time-lapse can also refer to a camera's shutter speed (How long the camera's shutter remains open to let light in). A similar effect to time-lapse is found in stop-motion videos. The subject doesn't move but seems to be in motion because it's manually or repeatedly moved and then photographed. The images are then strung together to create video-like motion.

![time lapse car video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/time-lapse-car-video.jpg)

## How Time-lapse Works

Time-lapse photography is a technique that records a scene or objects that change at a slow speed and turns it into a video that plays back at high speed.

Most time-lapse videos are projected at a speed of 30 frames per second. The frame rate of your time-lapse video can be determined in the editing process, but you will need to account for how quickly the action is taking place in the camera or your video will be a collection if stills. Consider what FPS you want to use in your video. You need to capture that many frames per second to create a time-lapse effect. If you're shooting a 10 second video at 30fps, you should end up with 300 images.

What equipment needed for time-lapse video?

Time-lapse photography requires only a few special pieces of equipment.

**1\. Camera / Smartphones**

Technically any point and shoot camera or smartphone can be used for time-lapse video, the easiest ones to work are DSLR or mirrorless cameras, some even have an in camera intervalometer (often called a time-lapse feature or time-lapse mode), which means you'll need less equipment to take great time-lapse video.

**2\. High-capacity Memory Card**

For the best results, shoot in RAW format which takes image in the highest resolution with actual image dimensions. You'll need to prepare for very large RAW file sizes, so bring multiple high capacity memory cards.

**3.Tripod**

A tripod is essential to time-lapse video or photography, because the camera needs to stay perfectly still in order to emphasize the steady movement of your subject and to avoid overlay blurry videos or photos.

## How to Capture Times-lapse Video

A technique that was once found only in video editing software is now on nearly every mobile device. So what's the best way to make an amazing time-lapse video that stands apart from the rest? That depends on how you plan to capture the footage.

**Smartphones:**

Most phones have a time-lapse feature in their camera app. Be advised: you will need to record for an extended period, as 30 minutes equates to about 10 seconds of footage. Like a video camera, you will need a tripod to steady your shots. On an iPhone, you can either film a time-lapse or stitch one together from your photo collection, all without a video editor.

**DSLR Camera**

For DSLR camera you'll need a tripod and a device called intervalometer. The first is essential to make sure your camera is stationary and is taking photos if the exact same location without moving anywhere.

An intervalometer, or a remote control, is a device that allows you to set your camera to hit the shutter button at an interval of your choice. In other words, an intervalometer is there to let you rest aside without having a manually click the shutter button yourself.

**Here are some video ideas for your time-lapse**

* Ice melting
* Flower and plants
* Clouds moving
* Sunrise/sunset
* Star movement
* Traffic movement

**Ice melting**

Time-lapse is an ideal way to capture the mesmerizing transition between water and ice. Even something as simple as watching ice melt can be appealing.

**Flower and plants**

Flowers and plants can be beautiful to behold, but their transformation from seed to adult plant is often absolutely breathtaking. If you have an indoor plant that you are about to start growing you can set up a camera on a mount of a tripod at the angle with which you want to capture. As you water, groom or fertilize on a regular schedule, you can incorporate taking a photograph at the same time.

**Clouds moving**

The clouds can provide a whole host of phenomena that will both enlighten the observer to the complexities of the atmosphere or cosmos but will also provide a beautiful spectacle in the daytime, the movement of clouds can be quite spell binding and the rolling in of rain or a thunderstorm can be particularly interesting.

**Sunrise/Sunset**

Shooting a sunset is more difficult. The light changes during the selected time period.

To overcome this, use remote control camera software. This can be compensated by increasing the ISO or decreasing the shutter speed as the light dims.

![shoot sunset timelapse video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-sunset-timelapse-video.jpg)

**Star movement**

At night, if the sky is clear and you are in an area dark enough, the stars in the sky can provide a beautiful time-lapse as the stars move in relation to the observer due to earths rotations.

**Traffic movement**

The interconnectedness of vehicles moving along busy roads, trailing light patterns, and the general hustle and bustle of city life can be brought to you in a dynamic way via time-lapse videos.

It is the smooth impression of motion which time-lapse is able to produce that can emphasize and help to invigorate something as ordinary and everyday as the coming and going of traffic.

**User's Guide to Play a Custom Slideshow in PowerPoint**

**Step 1: Launch the Parent Presentation**

In any suitable device of your preference, proceed with opening the presentation in which you have worked on creating the custom slideshow, followed by hitting the ‘Slide Show' tab in the PowerPoint ribbon at the top. From the list of options that appears next, click on the ‘Custom Slide Show' button.

**Step 2: Custom Slideshow Dropdown Menu**

**How to Set a Custom Show as the Default Slideshow?**

If you are interested in playing the custom show as a default presentation, see through the following stepwise tutorial guide to go ahead with the process:

The custom show is now your default slideshow. In your future launches of ‘Slide Show View', only the selected custom show slides will appear to be used as a presentation.

## Part 3 How to Hide Slides in PowerPoint?

In case you have worked on a detailed slideshow presentation in the PowerPoint tool, that consists of selective contents for different audience groups, all within the main presentation, it is a wise step to hide the content slides that are not useful to particular audiences, lest your viewers might get distracted with the irrelevant content.

By far, you must have developed a significant understanding of the **custom slideshow PowerPoint** creation and presentation procedure in much detail. Moving further into our discussion, let us now work on hiding slides within a PowerPoint presentation through the following step by step guide:

**How to Hide or Unhide a Slide in PowerPoint?**

**Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Presentation**

Start with opening a desired PowerPoint Presentation in your preferred device.

**Step 2: Make Your Selection**

Visit the slide navigation pane at the left to select slide you wish to delete. Your selections will be highlighted as you tap on them. You can either delete the slides one at a time, or make multiple selections to delete them all at once.

**Step 3: Hide Slide Option**

When you have made the required selections, right click on the same, followed by choosing the ‘Hide Slide' option from the dropdown menu that appears next. The selected slides will now be hidden and you can recognize them in the ‘Presenter View' with lighter thumbnails as compared to the included slides, in the slide navigation pane.

**Step 4: Unhiding the Presentation Slides**

If you wish to unhide a previously hidden presentation slide, reach to the slide navigation pane in the left and right click on the hidden slide thumbnail. The dropdown menu in Step 3 pops up again, and you need to tap on the ‘Hide Slide' option. The selected slide will now be included in the presentation.

An alternative to show a hidden slide within a running presentation, while remaining in the ‘Presenter View', make a random right click anywhere within the currently running slide. The ‘Options Panel' pops up, and you are required to choose the ‘See All Slides' option.

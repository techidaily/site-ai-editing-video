## Convert Time-Lapse to Normal Video

Ever since video cameras were invented, there have been various technological advancements in filming. And today people generally use smartphones or portable cameras to record videos. But one of the interesting ways in which smart devices can capture moments is using the timelapse feature. Timelapse files are a way of videography in which the camera or smart device captures frames in intervals of a few seconds or minutes.

In this way, you get a stop motion-like video at the end. This format of the video is both interesting and can be used to capture long hours of activities. But often we are needed to **convert time-lapse to normal video** to export or share them over a platform. For these requirements, there are different applications available across multiple operating systems.

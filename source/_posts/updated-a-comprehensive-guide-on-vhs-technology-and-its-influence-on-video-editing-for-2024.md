Videos are a person's crucial and cherished memory, and no one wants to compromise their quality. People tend to rely on several effects to exceed the quality of the beloved videos. VHS is the most used effect, popular in professional and personal videos. It stands for “Video Home System” and is often integrated with noises, color bleeding, and smooth glitches.

With **VHS-style** videos, you can not only make videos more high-class but can also intuitively define their worth. If you are new to this field, you should get familiar with the VHS effects in video. This context will provide basic information about **VHS tapes** and how to add VHS effects to videos.

## Part 1: What Is VHS Technology? An Overview of the 70s Sensation

From definition to usability, every piece of information plays an important role in your videography journey. Don't worry if you don't have video editing skills or know what **VHS means**. This section will provide you with reliable information about this:

### What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?

VHS, also known as Video Home System, are the auditory artifacts and visual glitches you see in the pictures. It creates a sense of distortion in the video, making the viewer think the camera equipment is malfunctioning. From the 1980s to the 1990s, this effect gained considerable popularity among video creators and viewers.

In recent years, retro lovers have brought this intuitive effect again into a trend to create a perfect flashback scene. The nostalgic and vintage appeal of these effects is insane. VHS is not just one effect because it divides into further categories. You are also free to select the VHS effects according to the theme of your video and the scene you are going to create.

### Key Aspects of The VHS Effects

Several key aspects are crucial to making high-quality VHS effects in the videos. You can see some of the key aspects listed and discussed here:

* **Tracking Lines of VHS:**The **VHS tapes** are integrated with magnetic strips to sort audio and video signals. However, over time, these tapes degraded, leading to glitches in playback with noticeable distortion.
* **Video Color Bleeding:**You must have noticed that color is bleeding in the VHS videos. In this, the colors in the videos are quite smudged and mixed. This together adds the unique yet smoother distortion in the videos.
* **Vintage and Glitching:**Vintage and glitches are essential to videos with VHS effects. This was initially caused by the limitations of playback equipment and signal interference. At this time, people add **glitch VHS** to the videos in a manual manner to add a sense of interference in the scene.
* **Noise and Jitters:**VHS tapes are known to be susceptible to wrappings and jitters. It causes a slightly unstable effect in the videos in the form of distorted objects. Moreover, the grainy and noisy appearance due to analog recording technology is also a part of this effect.

## How to Easily Convert SRT to VTT

While there are numerous subtitle formats, two of the most commonly used formats are SRT and Web VTT. SRT is also known as SubRip. The format got its name from a DVD ripping software that extracted subtitles from DVDs.

Web VTT stands for Web Video Text Track. Web VTT is a W3C standard that allows you to display the text in sync with the HTML 5 <track> element.

Both of them are quite similar; however, slight differences might make you choose one over the other.

## Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?

While SRT is a popular text file used for captions, Web VTT is not far behind. Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.

Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let's dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:

### What Does It Look Like

Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file's title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.

![difference between srt vs vtt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-srt-to-vtt-1.jpg)

| **Features/Subtitle Formats**                  | SRT                                  | VTT                                              |

| **Metadata**                                   | No                                   | Yes                                              |
| **Title**                                      | No                                   | Yes                                              |
| **A Numbering of The Subtitle Lines**          | Yes                                  | No                                               |
| **Basic Text Formats**                         | Not supported                        | Yes                                              |
| **Advanced Styling Fonts**                     | Simple                               | More robust styling including bold, italics, etc |
| **Support Changing the position of subtitles** | No                                   | Yes                                              |

### Timecode Format

The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.

### Metadata

A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.

### Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)

Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.

### Advanced Styling Fonts

Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.

### Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles

Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.

### Summary

So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer. Apart from differences in styling, time, and text formats, Web VTT files are incredibly easier to read and edit. You can also add comments which will remain hidden from the display.

## Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?

While SRT is a popular text file used for captions, Web VTT is not far behind. Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.

Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let's dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:

### What Does It Look Like

Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file's title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.

![difference between srt vs vtt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-srt-to-vtt-1.jpg)

| **Features/Subtitle Formats**                  | SRT                                  | VTT                                              |

| **Title**                                      | No                                   | Yes                                              |
| **A Numbering of The Subtitle Lines**          | Yes                                  | No                                               |
| **Basic Text Formats**                         | Not supported                        | Yes                                              |
| **Advanced Styling Fonts**                     | Simple                               | More robust styling including bold, italics, etc |
| **Support Changing the position of subtitles** | No                                   | Yes                                              |

### Timecode Format

The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.

### Metadata

A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.

### Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)

Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.

### Advanced Styling Fonts

Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.

### Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles

Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.

### Summary

So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer. Apart from differences in styling, time, and text formats, Web VTT files are incredibly easier to read and edit. You can also add comments which will remain hidden from the display.

Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.

**Step1: Create a new project & import media**

When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.

At the top menu bar again, click _File > Import > Media_ to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.

After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press _‘Import Selected’_ and then close the media window.

**Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.**

The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.

In your browser, you can set the _‘In_ and _Out’_ points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.

After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the _'Trim tool’._ Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip's endings.

If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position.

The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘_Command + 4’_ and make the adjustments.

**Effects**: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘_Effects browser’_ icon to open it.

Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.

**Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.**

**Audio & Music:** At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.

To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word _'Jingle_' and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.

**Color correction**: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.

Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.

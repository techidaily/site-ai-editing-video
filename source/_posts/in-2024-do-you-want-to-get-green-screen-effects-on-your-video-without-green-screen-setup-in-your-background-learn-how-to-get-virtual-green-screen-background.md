## Do You Want to Get Green Screen Effects on Your Video without Green Screen Setup in Your Background? Learn How to Get Virtual Green Screen Background and Shoot Videos Like a Pro

We have seen video creators on YouTube using green screen effects to beautify their background to make the video look professional and eye-catching. The same is applicable for gamers who live stream their gameplay on Twitch. Instead of physically hanging green screens in the background, some video creators opt for virtual green screens. Yes, it is possible to shoot videos with a virtual green background, and you do not have to buy screen greens and deal with the problem of hanging them in the background.

The concept of using virtual greenscreen is rather new, but it is getting popular among amateur video creators who do not want to invest in purchasing green screens initially. When you use a virtual background to shoot your video, the actual physical background is replaced completely with a virtual green background. Thereafter, you have to replace this virtual background with anything by using a video editor. In this article, we will illustrate how to use a virtual green screen to shoot video.

## 1\. Free Virtual Green Screen

In order to shoot a video with green virtual background, you cannot shoot your video with your regular camera app. Otherwise, your physical background will get recorded, and replacing that through video editor is going to be time-consuming. Therefore, there are specific apps available through which you have to shoot your video so that your physical background gets completely replaced by virtual greenscreen in real-time.

Snap Camera from Snapchat is a free app through which you can shoot your video to get a virtual green background. The app comes with a Green Screen filter that makes this virtual background effect possible. However, you will need a camera recording app that can record your video with green screen effects from Snap Camera. We will be using OBS Studio for recording the video which is also available for free. Snap Camera is compatible with Windows 10 and Mac 10.11+, and hence, you can use it to shoot video from your computer webcam. Here are the steps to follow –

Step 1: Download and install [Snap Camera app](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) on your computer.

Step 2: Set up your webcam perfectly so that its angle is direct to your face.

Step 3: Open Snap Camera app and you will see yourself on the app through your webcam. Select the appropriate Lens(filter) and you have to select Green Screen Snap Filter.

Step 4: You should see a green virtual background by now. Now, you have to launch OBS Studio (webcam recording software).

Step 5: Go to Sources and click on “+” icon and select Video Capture Device option.

Step 6: While configuration the new device, select Snap Camera as Device. This will enable green screen virtual backgrounds and you can start recording. After recording is done, save the file on your hard drive.

Now that you have recorded the video with green virtual background without green screen, it is time to edit the virtual greenscreen out with the video editor.

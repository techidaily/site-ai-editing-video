## Add VHS Effects to Videos for Free: A 2024 Guide

2023 has ushered in a wave of nostalgia, sweeping across various domains, from fashion to technology. Amidst this, videos have become a powerful medium to relive the past. If you're aiming to infuse your videos with a touch of the '90s, look no further than the VHS effect.

For those who need a quick trip down memory lane, VHS tapes were once the cornerstone of home entertainment. These clunky plastic cassettes captured countless memories, from family gatherings to favorite films and TV shows. While they might be alien to newer generations, they hold a special place in the chronicles of video evolution.

The VHS effect isn't just about mimicking the look of these tapes. It's about encapsulating their essence—grainy visuals, occasional jitters, and that characteristic static. Incorporating these imperfections into today's high-definition videos imparts a distinctive vintage flair. It's akin to applying an Instagram filter to a photo, where a simple touch can transport a viewer back in time. Dive in as we guide you on adding this retro charm to your free videos.

![What is a Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-01.jpg)

What is a Lower Third

A lower third is text and/or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.

A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.

Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.

## 2\. Why Add A Lower Third

So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”

Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.

In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.

![Why Add A Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-02.jpg)

Why Add A Lower Third

Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.

As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Tips:** A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.

## 3\. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third

As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.

[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.

Tip #1

###### Use Readable Font

Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.

Tip #2

###### Don’t Make It Too Long

There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.

Tip #3

###### Use Branding

A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.

Tip #4

###### Use Templates

Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.

Tip #5

###### Keep It Simple

Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don't use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.

Tip #6

###### Emphasize With Your Lower Third

Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.

The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Let us understand from the example given below.

* **Shot 1**: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Let us understand from the example given below.

* **Shot 1**: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.

##### What are light leaks?

Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.

Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.

##### Step1Access the light leak effects on Filmora

* Go to Effects on the Interface.
* Go to Overlay and choose the light Leak feature.
* You can also use any other light Leak stock in your capacity.

##### Step2Drag and drop the effects in the video editing

* Drag and drop the effect between any two cuts where you want to add this feature for a smooth transition.
* The effects should be placed above the video, in the timeline over the clip.

![filmora interface after dragging and dragging light leak effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/drag-and-drop-the-effects-in-the-video-editing.jpg)

##### Step3Setting the color and blend of the light leak effect

* Right-click on the clip, and go to "**Edit Properties."**

![accessing the properties of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/accessing-the-properties-of-the-clip.jpg)

* Go to the Composing menu. Then, go to **"Blend Mode"** and choose **"Screen."**
* It will adjust the light Leak feature to your entire screen.

![adjusting blend mode to screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjusting-blend-mode-to-screen.jpg)

##### Step4Fit the effect to the width of the screen

* Go to the **Transform** option in the clip properties.
* Click on both circles in front of the Scale option. It will adjust the effect to the entire frame width, giving it a pleasing outlook.

![adjusting the effect to frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-effect-to-frame.jpg)

There you go! Your light Leak filter is ready. Give attention to how the light floods the screen and the scene transitions from one part to the next.

Now, you are done with adding some additional color and light to your cuts. Your cuts are now smooth and trouble-free. Moving onto our next tip that will further polish your music video. It is called Reframing and Zooming.

### Reframe and zoom to polish your video

Another significant feature of Filmora is that it allows you to readjust the frame and zoom of the video. Any zooming option left undone in the shooting phase can be addressed in the editing phase.

For example, a director did an excellent job shooting a video. He considered every angle and yielded the best video shoot he could achieve. However, he missed a few zooming-out techniques while shooting. Now, what should one do? Use Filmora.

It is where the reframing and zooming feature of Filmora comes into play and saves the day.

##### What are the reframing and zooming features?

This feature allows you to adjust the zoom on the point of interest in the music video. If you want to add extra focus on a certain point, the feature in Filmora can do that for you. You can run zoom in or zoom out on any particular object or actor. Follow the given steps to understand how you can do that.

##### Step1Plan your video

* Where you want to reframe and zoom. Trim that part of the video.

![trimming the video to reframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/trimming-the-video-to-reframe.jpg)

##### Step2Choose any two points on the clip for reframing

* Choose any two points on the clip. These points are reference points. When the clip moves from one point to the next point, the reframing takes place.

##### Step3Adjust the scale and position of the clip

* Go to the Transform option in Clip properties.
* Go to the clip's end (2nd point), and turn on the Scale and Position circles.

![clicking on the circles in front of scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-scale-and-position-of-the-clip.jpg)

* Go to the start of the clip
* And adjust the value of scale and position.

Atl Text: Setting new value to Scale and Position.

##### Step4Replay the clip

* Once the scale readings and position in the initial point are set, replay the clip to observe the reframing.

![final result after reframing of the image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-result-after-reframing-of-the-image.gif)

You can use it on the static shots if you want. The procedure is the same. You have to adjust the scale and position of the screen to adjust reframing. Thus, Filmora fills gaps in your music video without the need to reshoot.

## Final words

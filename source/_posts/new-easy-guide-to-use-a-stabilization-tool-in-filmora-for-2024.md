## Easy Guide to Use a Stabilization Tool in Filmora

Does your video shake so much? Shaking movement on your camera is often inevitable, especially if you don't use a camera stabilizer or a camera with no built-in image stabilization. As a result, it can make your video look distracting and difficult to watch.

But you don't need to worry. You can use a stabilization tool in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). A stabilization tool is a feature that can help to correct for camera shake and other types of movement. If you are a handheld shooter, you will find this tool extremely helpful.

## Part 1: When do you need to stabilize your video?

Now, let's talk about when you should stabilize your video. If you're shooting something that is moving, like people or animals, you will definitely want to stabilize your video. This will help ensure that the video is smooth and steady.

Another time you may want to stabilize your video is if you're shooting in a low-light situation. It will help to ensure that your video is not too shaky.

Finally, if you're shooting a video that's going to be displayed on a large screen, you may want to stabilize your video. Stabilizing your video will help ensure the output is crisp and clear.

## Part 2: How to stabilize your video with Filmora

Filmora has a stabilization feature that can help to smooth your video and make it look more professional. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can download it for free.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

So, should you have a wobble movement in your video, follow these steps to make it smoother in no time:

Step1 Launch Filmora 11 and **create a new project**.

Step2 Import your video to Filmora.

![import your video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Step3 After you import your video to Filmora, the Stabilization must have been off. So, **switch the Stabilization toggle on**, then a loading bar will start going up to analyze the clip.

![switch the stabilization toggle on](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-2.jpg)

Step4 Once it finishes analyzing, the smooth level will default to 10\. See the preview whether you like how it turns out.

**Before**

![before finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-3.gif)

**After**

![after finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-4.gif)

Please note that the center point of your image will always be the most stable. The more shaky a clip is, the more it will crop into that image.

If you are unsatisfied with the default setting, increasing the Smoothness Level will result in more cropping to the image. On the contrary, if you put the Smoothness Level down to zero, you are no longer cropping into the image, but the result won't be as smooth.

![adjust smothness level as byou like](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-5.gif)

Should the cropping bother you, such as it crops the subject's hair out of the frame, you can adjust it with **Edge Processing**.

If you change it to **None**, you will see the black bars that simulate how it stabilizes the clip. Try to hit play on the preview screen, and then you can see more clearly how the tool keeps the center of the frame to make it stable and less shaky.

![hit play on the preview screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-6.gif)

As **Reflect** is the default, the **Extend** uses artificial intelligence to extend the pixels, as you are often aware in Photoshop.

![extend the pixels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-7.jpg)

Besides the three, there is also the **Tile** option. Each of them would give a different result. You can try and use the one that works best for you.

## Summary

When you're shooting a video, you must have wanted it to be as smooth and stable as possible. By stabilizing your video, you can help ensure it's smooth and easy to watch.

Filmora offers a Stabilization feature that allows you to easily improve your video's quality. Simply select the video clip you want to stabilize and click the stabilization button. Filmora will do the rest, giving you a smooth and stable video.

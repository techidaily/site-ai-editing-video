## Easy Way to Add Effects to Art Video

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a powerful tool and with the know-how can make your art be more than just a still image. Whether it is for a music video or a portfolio showreel, there are better ways than just inserting an image and letting it fade to the next still image. We can make use of effects and transitions to put our art to better use.

In this guide I’m going to show a couple of ways to enhance your images within [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your videos.

## Transitions

By inserting a transition to your image, you can add some diversity to how the viewer first see’s your image, You may want to emphasis a certain element of your art and therefore would select a transition that zooms in on that element before zooming out to the whole image or maybe you have a painting of a cyberpunk angel and wish to have the image enter in a grid formation. The point is that by experimenting with transitions and trying to select the best ones based on the element in your work you will achieve a better first impression. This is true for all aspects of video creation.

Having multiple transitions can create a unique look for your videos with minimal understanding of how to create a transition but there needs to be an understanding of how the layers work in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) being that a layer on top is in front of the one below, remember this when you start to add transitions as sometime you may need to duplicate your art as to keep it in the shot.

![add transitions art video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-transitions-art-video.jpg)

As you can see here, I have duplicated my image onto separate channels as to always keep the image in the scene.

![duplicated image onto separate channels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/duplicated-image-onto-separate-channels.jpg)

In the image above you can see how I used multiple transitions, I did this as my image is off center and I wanted to emphasize that, I picked transitions that had clear symmetry and lines so that the viewer had a reference point of where center was without me having to place that in my art. This is a very useful way of adding information to your art without telling the viewer directly. As for the color theory, I went with oranges and yellows predominantly here as they are neighboring colors on the color wheel and we know they work well together with my main color of yellow. As for the composition I have tried to keep all the eye-catching points along the top third of the image as to create a piece more pleasing to the eye even with all this information going on.

## Effects

The inclusion of effect onto your art should not be discouraged depending on what the art is used for, in my example i created this as though it was album art and the musician wanted to upload a simple music video using that art, on its own it is static and can loose engagement but by applying relevant effects you can capture the viewer's eye and make the listening experience more enjoyable. Effects can also be stacked to create unique assets for your art and help tell a story, if your art includes fire why not add a fire effect breaking the stillness of the image or maybe your art has motion, you could include a motion effect to your still image and give the viewer more information.

Even when using effects you can use fundamentals such as color theory or composition to better enhance your imagery.

![choose effect art video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-effect-art-video.jpg)

In this image you can see I have added an audio visualizer effect as well as a spectral light effect. I did this to reinforce the face of my image having a strong light source, it creates dynamic movement and the audio visualizer was added due to the nature of the video being music oriented but I felt this could have been done better. The composition of the audio visualizer was front and center and seemed boring and uninteresting. This is where the research into art fundamentals comes into play as remembering the rule of thirds and how all the main features of the image are in the top horizontal third, we can make use of the vertical thirds to gain a better composition and hopefully create more engagement.

![pewview art video effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/pewview-art-video-effects.jpg)

As you can see, we have duplicated the audio visualizer and made better use of the thirds nor having opposing placement within the scene, the same information is being given by the effect but we have managed to use the space more effectively and created a visually pleasing aesthetic to our video. Trick like this can make your still image feel more animated and have more purpose within the video itself.

## Adding Titles and Text

Adding text is another way of adding information to your art. It's said an image can speak a thousand words but sometimes you need words to talk for an image. When words are needed for your video, there should be some thought into how them words are presented as just selecting any text and inserting that to your video may look jarring to the viewer and result in a loss of interest towards your videos. Selecting the right transition for your text or the color or even the font can have different results and can help with affordance depending on what you're looking to portray.

![add text title art video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-text-title-art-video.jpg)

In my example I wanted to say thank you and felt sharp edges would seem formal and because of the main image it would be too similar so I went with a font that was more rounded. When inserting text onto a scene such as this one you are given a lot of information for your selections, we already have color in there to help us choose our font and background color, I went with yellow and pink due to the fact it was already in the scene and I didn’t want to take the attention away from the focus. The way the text transitions onto the screen secures just enough attention to itself that the viewer knows it's there and can read it if they wish to. If I wanted to gain full attention i would have picked a transition that overlaps the key element and picked complementary colors on the opposite sides of the color wheel guaranteeing the viewer's eyes would notice and engage with the motion.

## Conclusion

By incorporating all the art fundamentals and skills we have learned we can use the tools provided by [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) more effectively and create dynamic and engaging videos that are aesthetically pleasing for our audience. Upon learning the many different types and styles of transitions, effects, and titles we can enhance our artwork for use within our video. This includes artwork specifically made for use in video or even to show off your art and gain a wider audience. These are forever evolving and what you find is pleasing now may change in the future but that's part of the fun with learning a new skill as you will find what you like and progress from there creating an identifiable style that viewers will recognize and associate you with.

## Learn to Create Custom Sequence Presets in Premiere Pro for Efficient Video Editing. Ensure Consistency and Speed up Your Workflow with Personalized Settings

You've probably heard of Adobe Premiere Pro – it's a top-tier video editing software that's widely recognized in the market. But have you delved into the nitty-gritty of sequence presets? A custom sequence preset is your best friend for maintaining consistency across projects.

It allows users to save specific settings for sequence attributes like frame rate, resolution, and audio settings. Instead of reconfiguring these settings for each new project, a custom sequence preset lets you jump right into editing. Now, how do you create one? Keep reading!

## Part 1: How to Create a Custom Sequence in Premiere Pro

Creating a custom sequence is like tailoring a shirt to fit you perfectly. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do just that:

### Step 1: Displays the New Sequence Window

Begin by launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once opened, navigate to the top menu and select **_File_ \> _New_ \> _Sequence_**. This will open up the New Sequence window, where all the magic happens!

### Step 2: Change the Editing Mode to Custom in the Settings Panel

You'll see several tabs in the New Sequence window, but we will focus on the **"Settings"** tab for our purposes. Click on it.

Here, you'll find the **'Editing Mode'** dropdown menu. By default, it's set to a specific format like **'DSLR'** or **'AVCHD**.' Change this to 'Custom.' This will unlock a plethora of options for you to play with.

**Deep Dive into Settings:**

1. **Frame Size:** Define your video’s width and height. Remember, 1920x1080 is Full HD, and 3840x2160 is 4K. Choose based on your project needs.
2. **Frame Rate:** 24fps is the cinematic standard, but if you're creating content for TV or web, 30fps or 60fps might be more suitable.
3. **Pixel Aspect Ratio:** Stick with **'Square Pixels'** unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
4. **Fields:** Choose 'No Fields' for progressive footage. If you're unsure, this is a safe bet.
5. **Audio Settings:** Here, you can configure the sample rate, among other things. 48000Hz is standard for video.

### Step 3: Give the New Preset a Name and Save It

Once you've customized the settings to your satisfaction, it's time to save this configuration for future use. At the bottom of the New Sequence window, you’ll see a **'Save Preset'** button. Click on it.

A pop-up window will show up, requesting you to provide a name for your new preset. Choose something descriptive so you can easily recognize it later. Once named, click **'OK'**.

Your custom sequence preset is now saved and will appear under the **'Custom'** folder in the **'Sequence Presets'** tab.

## Part 2: Why Custom Sequence Presets are Essential for Efficient Editing

As you delve deeper into video editing, you'll begin to appreciate the little things that shave off minutes from your workflow, allowing you to dedicate more time to the creative process. This is precisely where the utility of custom sequence presets in Premiere Pro comes into play. But why are these presets so crucial?

* **Consistency Across Projects:** If you’re managing multiple projects or a series of videos, having a standard format ensures that all your content has a uniform look and feel. Consistency is a hallmark of professional-grade content. It's not just about the visuals – maintaining a uniform audio quality and format is equally significant. With a preset, you no longer need to remember the minutiae of each setting, ensuring consistency effortlessly.
* **Speed Up Your Workflow:** Every minute you spend adjusting the sequence settings is a minute less you have for cutting, color correcting, audio mixing, or adding those special effects that make your videos pop. Over time, those minutes can add up to hours. By using a custom sequence preset, you can jump straight into the creative part of editing without the preliminary setup.
* **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Have you ever rendered an entire project only to find that the frame rate was off or the audio was set to the wrong sample rate? These kinds of errors can occur when setting up a new sequence from scratch each time. By relying on a preset, you mitigate the risks of such oversights.
* **Personalized Templates for Different Platforms:** Different platforms may have varying preferred settings. For instance, the ideal video format for YouTube might differ from that of Instagram or TikTok. Instead of Googling these settings each time, you can have a custom sequence preset ready for each platform, ensuring your content is optimized wherever it's destined.
* **Ease of Collaboration:** If you're working as part of a team, having standard sequence presets ensures everyone is on the same page. This is particularly handy when multiple editors are working on different segments of the same project. With custom presets, you're not just aligning sequences but also visions.

Incorporating this practice into your editing routine might initially seem trivial, but its benefits compound with time.

## Part 3: Summary

Creating a custom sequence preset in Adobe Premiere Pro isn’t just about streamlining your workflow – it’s about ensuring consistency across your projects.

By saving your most-used settings, you're creating a base template that can be pulled up any time, granting you more time for the creative process.

Adobe Premiere Pro's interface is designed to make tasks like these intuitive, so even if you're a beginner, with a bit of practice, you'll be creating custom sequence presets like a pro.

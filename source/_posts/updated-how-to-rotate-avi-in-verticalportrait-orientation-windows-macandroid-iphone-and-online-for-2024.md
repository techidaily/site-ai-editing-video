Introduced in 2003, Adobe Premiere Pro is known to be a video editing software. It has a lot of features that can be used in the process of editing. It’s capable of editing feature movies such as Hollywood and the likes.

* STEP 2 - Click on frame size and type in 3840; for the horizontal, type in 2160 and then proceed to click ok

FIXING A PORTRAIT SHOT

* Put your play-head (the thin line that moves over the clips on your timeline) on the clip on the timeline

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-12.jpg)

* Go to ‘scale’, and type in the number according to the degree you desire to effect

 your rotation. However, your video will be just perfect if you type in -90

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-13.jpg)

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’
* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip
* STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical
* STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-16.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-19.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

Video editing is the process of cutting and rearranging multiple clips or segments of video to create a new and more improved video. This involves adding titles, animations, sound effects, music and more. Video editing has not ceased to follow the trend of technology as it keeps thriving tirelessly through the ages.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-13.jpg)

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’
* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip
* STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical
* STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-16.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-19.jpg)

## Best 9 Amv Makers for Computer

They allow fans to showcase their creativity and love for their favorite anime series through the use of music and video editing. However, creating a high-quality AMV requires the right software. In this article, we will introduce you to the best AMV maker software available on the market.

## Best AMV Maker for Computer

If you would like to create the AMVs on your computer, the following are some of your best options;

**Filmora**

Best For: Vloggers, teachers and social media users

Supported OS: Windows 11/10/8/7 and macOS

![filmora video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/reverse-option-filmora-toolbar.jpg)

Speaking of the best AMV video maker, I would recommend Filmora as the first choice. It is easy to learn and use for beginner, and come with rich video editing features: split screen, key framing, motion tracking, speed ramping, instant mode, speech to text, audio ducking and more.

Meanwhile, it also helps teachers or business people to record tutorials, files or PowerPoint from their screen wit no limit. For vloggers and other advanced users, Filmora provides green screen, AI Protrait, colorful video effect templates, color match and so forth. You can directly share the video to YouTube, Vimeo and other social media platforms.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

**Adobe Premiere**

Best For: Animators, professional cartoonists, and marketers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Adobe Premiere is a video editing program that can be used to create and edit all types of video projects including AMVs. It has numerous features that can make it very easy to come up with the most professional video that you want to create. Because of these very many, but very useful features, using Adobe Premiere can be difficult at first. But once you gate a hang of it, it is one of the best ways to create any video including AMVs.

Adobe Premiere can be used on both Mac and Windows operating systems and it is compatible with most video and audio formats. But like most Adobe software it is not a free solution. You do get a 7-day free trial that you can use without limitation, but you will need to pay a subscription fee to continue using it.

**Apple iMovie**

Best For: Marketers, freelancers, YouTubers, Bloggers

Supported OS: Mac

![apple imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-interface.jpg)

Apple iMovie is one of the best video editing programs for Mac and is therefore one of the best tools to choose if you will be creating your AMV on a Mac. It has all the basic video editing features that you need for a project of this magnitude including the ability to merge videos and apply filters.

This makes it the most ideal tool for creating AMVs since you typically need to break a file into various sections for your AMV. You can then add audio to the video and choose one of the effects and filters to add to it. Once the video is complete, you can then export it in 4K resolution or upload it to YouTube directly.

**Sony Vegas**

Best For: Animators, Marketers, Video Editors and Bloggers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![sony vegas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

If you are looking for a program that is designed with AMVs in mind then Sony Vegas might be a good choice. Its main purpose is to help users create stunning anime videos and it has all the necessary features to make that happen.

Sony Vegas comes with a universal editor that allows you to create your video using the multi-cam editing feature or crossfades. You can also add various effects to the video including various colors and other special effects. But as you can probably guess, Sony Vegas may be a bit complicated for the beginner user, although there are numerous tutorials to help you through this process.

**Final Cut Pro**

Best For: Marketers, Animators, YouTubers, Freelancers, and Professional video editors

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-cut-pro.jpg)

Final Cut Pro is another professional and highly effective video editor that you can use to create AMVs. It has very many video editing capabilities, allowing you to edit your video in numerous ways including cropping, rotating, blending, and more. It also has over 100 different transitions and more than 149 different visual effects to create your video any way you want to.

But perhaps the best feature that Final Cut Pro has when it comes to creating and editing AMV videos is the ability to organize and crop videos easily. The “Compounding Clips” feature, in particular, will come in handy when combining footage, soundtracks, and effects into one perfect AMV.

**Lightworks**

Best For: YouTubers, Freelancers, Bloggers, and Marketers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![lightworks video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lightworks-video-editor.jpg)

Lightworks is an easy-to-use solution that you can use to create stunning AMV videos. The drag and drop interface makes it the most ideal solution even for beginners and it offers a lot of options for designing and customizing the videos. One other major benefit of choosing Lightworks is that it does come with a free version that is not as limited as you would expect.

The timeline is easy to use, allowing you to create AMVs from scratch or merge clips to create the video. You can also use numerous effects on the video and even add music to the video.

**Windows Movie Maker**

Best For: Freelancers, bloggers, marketers, and YouTubers

Supported OS: Windows

![windows movie maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker.png)

Windows Movie Maker is one of the most popular video editing tools on the Windows OS and it has all the necessary editing features that you will need when you want to create AMV videos. On this free video editing tool, you can cut, split and crop the video or even add audio files and subtitles as needed,

It can work with numerous video and image formats, offering a wide range of options when it comes to video editing. Some of the functions that you can expect to use include video trimming, which can easily be done by simply dragging the slider to the desired location. But you will find that Windows Movie Maker lacks some of the features that can make your AMVs truly stand out.

## Best AMV Maker for Mobile Phones

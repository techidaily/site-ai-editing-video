## Part 2: Top Guide Explaining How to Replace Sky in Adobe After Effects?

Do you want to elevate the graphics of your videos professionally? Adobe After Effects is an ideal software for it as it helps professionals to edit films. It offers multiple animations for titles and videos like revolve, rotate, and more. In addition, you can overlap videos with precision using its Rotoscope feature.

There are built-in effects and features to ease the editing process for you. In addition, you can do custom settings in it and save them as presets. One of its many specifications is that it is an elite background remover and replacement. It enables a seamless addition of the sky in the background. We have mentioned the step-by-step procedure of **After Effects replace Sky** below:

### Procedure 1: Removing Video Background

**Step 1:** After bringing your video to the timeline, navigate towards the top search bar at the left. In the Effects Control option, search for the "Extractor" effect and add it. Then, change the "Channel" of this effect to your "Blue" or "Luminance." Change the position of both sliders there to remove and feather the background.

**Step 2:** To avoid removing parts other than the sky, duplicate this video to the timeline. From the bottom video, eliminate the extractor effect. Navigate towards the top toolbar and select the "Mask" option. Create a mask around the ground at the bottom of the video. In the timeline, click the "Mask Path" option to create the mask throughout the video.

### Procedure 2: 3D Camera Tracking

**Step 1:** Now, duplicate the video again on the timeline and remove all its effects. Afterward, add a "3D Camera Tracker" in it. Then click "Analyze" and let the tracker analyze your video.

![activate 3d tracking for mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next, select any three points from the footage and right-click on them. From the drop-down menu, select "Create Null and Camera" or "Create Solid and Camera."

### Procedure 3: Replacing the Sky

**Step 1:** Import the video of your sky and bring it to the timeline. Bring the sky in the back of your footage and change it to a 3D layer. Afterward, change the "Position" of your sky from the timeline. We recommend you set the values as far away as possible for realistic effect.

![adjust the position of sky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-7.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once you have set the sky's position, navigate towards the timeline panel again. From there, change the "Scale" of the background to set according to your footage. Afterward, see if the sky needs any flipping. This is because you must align the bright parts of the sky with the bright parts of the ground.

### Procedure 4: Color Matching

**Step 1:** Play with the color setting elements like "Saturation" or "Lightness." Change the position of their sliders to observe the changes in your footage.

![do basic color corrections](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-9.jpg)

## Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro

We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let's discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.

* Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn't do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.
* Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.
* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.
* Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.
* The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don't bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.

## People Also Ask

Before we bid you goodbye, let's answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.

Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.

### Q2\. What Is a Logo Reveal?

Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.

A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting.

**Simple**

Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.

**Versatile**

**High-quality typography**

The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.

## Part 2: Some Quick Alternatives to Efectum App for Slowing Down Videos

Efectum is undoubtedly a good platform to change video speed with other editing options. Some users might find it boring and get annoyed due to the watermark it locates in videos. They want an alternative to the **Efectum app download without a watermark**. Thus, in this section, we have enlisted the current best replacements for Efectum that are worth trying.

* [FXMotion Slow Fast Video Maker](#alternative1)
* [CapCut - Video Editor](#alternative2)
* [InVideo](#alternative3)
* [VN-Video Editor & Maker](#alternative4)
* [InShot Video Editor & Maker](#alternative5)

### 1\. FXMotion Slow Fast Video Maker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/fxmotion-slow-fast-video-maker/id1559517301))

If you are unsatisfied with the **Efectum app** for limited speed adjustments, try this app. It is designed to change video speed in your own way with the speed graph. You can create a slow-motion video of up to 0.1x speed and a fast motion of up to 10x speed. With high-quality resolution output, it serves quick response. This application lets you share the edited video with friends on social media.

![fxmotion slow fast video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-5.jpg)

 Pros

* Allow choosing output quality from 480p and 1080p resolution options.
* Provides a music library to add thrill or sensation to slow-down videos.

 Cons

* Restrict you just to change speed and does not offer any feature for video editing.

### 2\. CapCut - Video Editor ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/capcut-video-editor/id1500855883)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemon.lvoverseas&hl=en&gl=US))

It’s a popular video editor with advanced editing and pre-designed video templates. This platform offers built-in fonts, effects, and stickers to add creativity to your content. Furthermore, CapCut provides you with Chroma key, stabilization, and Keyframe animation options. Besides these advanced features, you can alter video speed from 0.1x to 10x. Also, it lets you add a speed curve for a smooth, slow motion.

![capcut video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-6.jpg)

 Pros

* Add auto-caption and lyrics in videos with speech recognition ability.
* Extract audio clips or add sound effects from a rich music library.

 Cons

* It does not offer exporting in frame rate higher than 60fps.

### 3\. InVideo ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.filmrapp.videoeditor&hl=en&gl=US))

Instead of an **Efectum app download,** discover possibilities with InVideo. This app is an expert in creating aesthetic stop motions, ads, reels, and tutorials. It can speed up and speed down your clips. In addition, you can make a boomerang of shots and add cinematic transitions in clips. From its extensive music library, users can add music or import voiceovers.

![invideo video slow motion app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-7.jpg)

 Pros

* Utilize over 150 stickers, filters, and text templates to level up your projects.
* Record new footage with a built-in 60fps frame rate and 4k resolution.

 Cons

* The best footage stock and other assets are reserved for subscribed users.

### 4\. VN-Video Editor & Maker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/is/app/vn-video-editor/id1343581380)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frontrow.vlog&hl=en&gl=US))

If searching for an alternative like the **Efectum app, download without the watermark**; use this app. It satisfies the needs of professionals and amateur video editors with high-quality videos. VN’s speed curve is more like Adobe Premiere Pro’s speed ramping. Thus, you can adjust the playback of your video with 6-speed adjustment curves.

![vn video editor and maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-8.jpg)

 Pros

* It enables you to freeze frames, reverse videos, and add keyframe animations.
* Perform multi-trach timeline editing and save non-destructive editing drafts anytime.

 Cons

* You might face laggings in playback or missing audio in exported videos.

### 5\. Video Editor & Maker – InShot ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/inshot-video-editor/id997362197)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.camerasideas.instashot&hl=en&gl=US))

Another good option in place of the **Efectum app** that you can consider is InShot. This platform offers some AI features such as auto-caption, smart tracking, and AI effects. InShot enables you to make smooth slow-mo with a speed ramping feature and keyframe editing. Plus, you can create multi-layered videos with filters, transitions, and AI effects.

![video editor and maker inshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-9.jpg)

 Pros

* Make photo collages with AI effects and blend screenshots with AI context recognition.
* Export videos in 4K resolution to YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp.

 Cons

* Impose a watermark on videos unless you pay to remove it, which annoys many users.

## Part 3: Want to Make Advanced Changes to Your Slow-Motion Videos? Shift To Wondershare Filmora

[Mobile apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) have enabled you to work anywhere but with a strong internet connection. If you don’t have an active internet connection, you will not process video editing. That’s exactly where desktop tools ensure smooth work progress without the internet. Moreover, desktop applications offer more flexibility in editing with advanced features.

In this regard, you should use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an exception video editor. This software proves to be the right platform for slowing down videos with many customization options. It is integrated with AI and offers AI features to boost your productivity with creativity. You can get assistance from AI Copilot and generate copyright-free music or images on Filmora.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### How to Use Filmora for Creating Slow-Motion Videos

This AI platform is not limited to cutting and merging clips; thus, explore it by installing it. Using Filmora is not a big deal, but you can follow the step-by-step guide for further clarity.

##### Step 1Launch Filmora 13 and Initiate a Project

![navigate to new project option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-10.jpg)

##### Step 2Slow Down the Speed with Uniform Speed Option

Right-click on the video and select the “Uniform Speed” option from the list. Direct toward the right side and find a “Speed” slider to adjust the speed. Move it to the left for slow-motion video and preview changes simultaneously. Toggle the "Ripple Edit” and “Maintain Pitch” for better results. Go to the “AI Frame Interpolation” and choose “Optical Flow” from the extended list.

![adjust uniform speed settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-11.jpg)

##### Step 3Use Speed Ramping to Customize Slow Motion and Export

If you want to shift speed in videos smoothly, press the “Speed Ramping” from the top. Pick any ramping template or tap on the “Customize” option. Reach the graph below and slow down the speed by moving the dots downward. Adjust the speed ramping by locating the graph dots and seeing changes. Now, go to the top right side and choose “Export” to get the video on your device.

![apply custom speed ramping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-12.jpg)

**●** Identify if you wish to add the text as the focal point or not. If you are using the text as the first striking thing in the collage then ensure that it is eye-catchy and interesting.

**●** Keep a good balance between the text and the images so that it does not look weird.

**●** The color and the font of the text are among the most important factors to be considered. Make sure that both the text color as well as the font match and blend well with the theme and the images in the collage.

**●** Keeping the background of the text simple, less detailed, and also clutter-free is important so that the text content comes out nicely.

![slow mo feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-1.jpg)

But do you ever feel like converting the slow-motion video in your iOS device to a normal video? Perhaps you thought the slow-mo video would be more attractive, but it's not, or maybe you want to determine how to remove slow-motion from a video iPhone.

No matter the reason, there are numerous ways to remove slow motion from iPhone video. In this article, you'll learn the various methods to convert slow-motion video into a regular video on your iPhone or iPad. Also, learn the steps involved in achieving it.

So, let's start.

## How To Convert Slow Motion Video to Normal on iPhone and iPad

Due to the slow-motion and Time-lapse modes that are built into the iPhone, people may quickly record slo-mo and time-lapse clips using their iOS smartphone cameras.

Access the iPhone camera, select Slo-mo, press the Record icon once to begin filming, and then press it once more to stop. This will create a slo-mo video.

Do you ever wish to get your video's slow motion removed? How to convert slow-motion video to normal on an iPhone? Well, here's your answer.

### Method 1\. Using the Photos App

The Photos app is an in-built app for iPhone and iPad that features editing capabilities like rotation, resizing, and auto-enhancement, in addition to helping you manage videos and images.

![using the photos app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-2.jpg)

You may quickly and effortlessly turn a slow-mo video into a regular-speed one with the Photos app's tucked-away slow-motion converter feature. Additionally, there won't be any quality loss in your video.

And here are the steps on how to remove slow-mo from iPhone video using the Photos app on an iPad or iPhone to turn it to normal speed.

Step1: Take your iPad or iPhone, navigate to the Photos app, open it, and then go to the bottom to hit the Albums tab.

Step2: Choose the Slo-mo option, and subsequently select the video you wish to turn into a regular speed video. Go to the top right corner of the screen and hit the Edit button.

![select the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-3.jpg)

Step3: If you look under the timeline, you'll find vertical lines. Here, the area with apart spaces signifies slow motion.

![find vertical lines](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-4.jpg)

Step4: To learn how to remove slow mo from iPhone video is to learn how to turn it into regular speed. To do so, select the slow-motion bar and drag it towards the other one to position the lines at a close distance.

Step5: When finished, hit the Done button and save this video. However, if you think this change was unnecessary or incorrect, you can discard it by clicking on Edit → Revert → Revert To Original.

#### Editing Tip

* The Photos app on iPhone doesn't allow you to convert any video shot at 24fps or 30fps to slow motion.
* You cannot reduce or decrease the overall size of the video after conversion.

#### Pros & Cons

 Pros

* It is a built-in app on every iOS device.
* Saves the hassle of downloading any third-party app.
* No charges are applicable for using this app.
* Excellent slow-mo video convertor.

 Cons

* Limited speed adjustment for the conversion of slow-mo videos into regular videos.

### Method 2: Using Other Converter Apps

You may think that converting slow-mo video to a regular speed video on your iPad or iPhone is convenient, but there's a drawback too. The method mentioned above can only help you with minimalistic speed changes, which may not give you the desired result.

However, other converter apps also help you change slow-mo video to regular iPhone video. These apps work seamlessly on your PC or Mac to turn your slow-mo videos on the iPhone or Mac to normal-speed video using customized and high-resolution settings.

![color matching game necessary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/color-match-game-top-tips-for-you-2.jpg)

The following list points out the importance of learning colours for children.

**●** **Integrates basic knowledge**

Knowing about the different colours is the basic and the most initial information that every child must have. We need colours in every instance of our lives. Therefore, it is vital for the children to learn about them from the initial stages of their lives.

So, learning about the colours integrates the basic knowledge of colours in their minds which is to stay with them throughout their lives and utilize them as and when the necessity arises.

**●** **Offers them a means for verbal communication**

When a child learns about colours, they attain a way to describe the world around them. Therefore, it helps in enhancing their method of communication. As a result, it also nurtures and improves their verbal skills to a large extent.

When they know about the colours, it inaugurates a novel hallway of set communicating and knowing about the world around them.

**●** **Offers a way of describing the world**

For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.

So, when they learn about colours, they tend to find a way to describe the environment. It gives them a better understanding of the world and their surrounding as they learn about the colours.

**●** **Learning to classify and sort**

When a child learns about colours, they tend to learn about sorting things and classifying the different objects based on colours. For example, they might be able to separate blue balloons from the red ones from a bunch of balloons in front of them.

Though it is based on colours, they learn the process of classification and sorting, which then gets applied to the other factors in life.

**●** **Learning about safety and health through colours**

The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures. That is commonly reflected through the traffic lights, where we stop at red colour, get ready to move in the colour tallow and the green colour gives us the signal to move or the message of being out of danger.

Also, the colour blue indicates paleness or bruises in the skin. The colour red indicates rashes or blood. So, the knowledge of colour helps the children learn about safety and health.

**●** **Learn about association**

The above point of learning about health and safety with the help of colours includes learning another important aspect in life, which is association. If a child is unable to understand that the colour red is associated with danger, green is associated with safety and the like; then the knowledge will be of no use.

So, when the child learns about colours and connects them to the different safety and health measures, they automatically learn how to associate one thing with another. This process is crucial and will benefit them throughout their lives.

**●** **Learn about letters**

Eventually, as the child learns about colours, they would spell them as well. So, as a result, they will learn how to spell different colours. That will be a way to practice spelling, and this will result in them learning about letters and words a lot more efficiently and excitingly.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-4.png)

You will notice that I have changed the rotation of my video from its original position to the rotated angle.

You can rotate upside down, rotate left, rotate right or 90 degrees clockwise, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, 360 degrees rotate, and back to the original. Check the video result in the preview window. Once you get satisfied with the rotation.

* Hit the **ok**
* Select the **save**

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-5.png)

Similarly, you can drag the video from the preview panel and adjust it as required.

Here, you can **Flip** function your video to change the direction. Like in this screenshot, suppose you want to change the place from right to left. You can easily change the direction by hitting on the flip tab.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-6.png)

Now you can see that the image has flipped without making a big effort you can also do it. I have done it for you, you are smarter.

Just go ahead and start…

 Scale is also used to remove the unwanted and rubbish scenes from the selected video. Like if you don’t want to show something behind the scene, you can use the scale function to cut that scene from your video.

### **What’s more you can do with Filmora**

**Changing the Aspect ratio**

After you rotate the video at an angle you like. You can change the aspect ratio of the video furthermore.

* **Import** the desired video and drag it into the **timeline**. Then click the Aspect Ratio icon at the bottom of the preview window.
* You can select the 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, or custom aspect ratio.
* Press **OK**

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-7.png)

By the way, you can choose the suitable aspect ratio according to the social media platform you are using. Like, a 1:1 aspect ratio for Instagram, a 9:16 aspect ratio for portrait videos, and a 4:3 standard video.

## **Conclusion**

Here’s how you can rotate your video using two different softwares. Now you can shoot your videos without setting the proper video orientation. Sometimes, while shooting a video, the real scene unfolds in making a lot settings. I hope, after reading this content, you will be confident enough to start shooting videos and then editing them without having trouble of learning the software.

Let’s dive in!

Go ahead…

A good destiny is waiting for you.

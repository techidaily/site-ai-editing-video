## Optimizing GPU Performance for Warzone on Windows 11 - Fixed

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/warzone-gpu-0.jpg)

 Released in early 2020, Warzone is still one of the hottest FPS in 2021\. But the game is never problem-free, and many players are still reporting that**the game isn’t using GPU** . If you’re on the same boat, don’t worry. Here’re some working fixes that can help you get everything back on track.

 Before troubleshooting, you should**try different hardware monitors** to see if it’s just a false alarm.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try all of them, simply work your way down until you find the one that does the trick.

1. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Change settings in your graphics control panel**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Set graphics preference to High performance**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Run Warzone in Windowed mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, Warzone won’t work properly with your GPU when you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . So first you need to make sure you have the latest correct graphics driver. The newest driver usually helps improve compatibility and boost in-game performance.

 You can update the GPU driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s websites ([**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), searching your graphics card and downloading the latest correct installer. But if you don’t like playing with computer drivers, you can update the GPU driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/de-pro-3070-update-all.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your PC and test the gameplay in Warzone.

 If the latest GPU driver doesn’t give you luck, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2: Install all Windows updates

 Windows updates make your system more reliable. Some patches come with new features that might tackle issues in allocating resources. You should always make sure your system is up to date.

Here’s how you can check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win** (the Windows logo key). At the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**gear icon** to open Settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-gear-icon.jpg)
2. Scroll down and select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update.jpg)
3. Click**Windows Update** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-2.jpg)
4. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for the process to complete. After that, restart your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-3.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

Once done, restart your PC and see if Warzone is using your GPU.

 If updating your system doesn’t help, you can take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 3: Change settings in your graphics control panel

 You can also force Warzone to run on your graphics card by changing settings in the graphics control panel. If you don’t know how, here’re the steps for NVIDIA GPUs:

1. Right-click the empty area of your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/nvidia-control-panel.jpg)

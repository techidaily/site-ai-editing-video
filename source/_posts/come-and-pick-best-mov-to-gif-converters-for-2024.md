For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.

When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in "Fast Mode" or "Encode Mode". The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.

## Best 8 Animated Video Makers

Animations can be a great way to get your work to stand out and the best animated video maker can help you get this effect very easily. Here, we will be helping you find the best way to create animated videos for your particular project.

It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.

Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.

## When to Use an Animated Video Maker

There are several reasons why you would want to create an animated video, rather than use traditional video solutions. The following are the most important from a digital marketing standpoint;

**Improve Conversion and Sales**

Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.

**Increase Brand Awareness**

Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.

**Generate Online Leads**

Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.

**Explain Complex Processes**

It can be very difficult to try to explain very complex ideas such as the mechanical aspect of a certain tool using words. But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.

## **Wrapping Things Up**

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video. No matter how wonderful or perfect a video clip is, if the audio playing while watching it is terrible, it may be a very frustrating experience. So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

## **Wrapping Things Up**

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video. No matter how wonderful or perfect a video clip is, if the audio playing while watching it is terrible, it may be a very frustrating experience. So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

1. Navigate to the "Edit" page.
2. Select the tab "Media Pool."
3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

It's best to link the soundtrack (music, sound effect, or background music) to the relevant video once you've adjusted the audio file.

Here's how to connect audio and video in a timeline:

1. Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" to toggle both the video and audio.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."
3. The sound and visual are now both connected.

Thus, you can rest guaranteed that the audio will follow your movie wherever it goes. There will be no issues with out-of-sync!

### **How Do You Link Many Audio and Video Files Together in DaVinci Resolve?**

Several video and audio segments can be linked together to form a single one. You can rearrange them anywhere in the timeline, and they will not be out of sync.

This is how you connect many clips:

1. By holding down the "Ctrl" or "Cmd" key, you can choose all the video and audio clips you want.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcut keys "Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L".
3. Now, all your video or audio files are linked together.

### **Is Any Music Available to Use for Editing?**

Understanding copyright law can be complicated. It's best to use free music for video editing if you don't want to be accused of copyright violation.

Additionally, you can purchase two licenses to avoid copyright concerns. The producer controls the synchronization license, and the master license to use the song recording is managed by the publishing company.

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

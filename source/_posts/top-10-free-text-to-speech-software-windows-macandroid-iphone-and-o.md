Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man's input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.

We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.

Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.

Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

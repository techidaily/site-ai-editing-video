## 2 Ways to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix

Netflix is the most popular streaming service in the world. It offers loads of movies and series that you can watch on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Over the years, Netflix has become a one-stop destination for watching movies and TV shows in different languages.

While the user base of Netflix is quite diverse, the platform offers subtitles in limited languages for most movies and series. Suppose you want to view a Korean Drama on Netflix with French subtitles. However, you found that French subtitles are unavailable for that Korean Drama. In such a case, you might wonder if adding custom subtitles to Netflix is possible.

Well, you can add subtitles to Netflix, and there are two different methods to do the same. This guide will help you learn both methods available for adding custom subtitles to Netflix. So, let's get started!

## Method 1\. Upload Your Custom Subtitle to Netflix

Before proceeding with this method, you must remember that it only works if you are a Netflix Premium user. Now, let's discuss how to add subtitles to Netflix with this method.

### Key Steps to Follow

Below are the steps for adding custom subtitles to Netflix.

Step 1 First of all, you need to install and add [Language Learning with Netflix & YouTube™](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/bekopgepchoeepdmokgkpkfhegkeohbl?hl=en-US) extension to your web browser (Chrome or Edge).

Step 2 Make sure the extension is activated.

Step 3 Download the .srt file that contains the subtitles in your preferred language for a particular movie or TV show.

Step 4 Open Netflix on a Chrome or Edge browser and sign into your account.

Step 5 Play the movie or TV show for which you have downloaded the subtitles.

Step 6 Within the Netflix player, you will see a settings icon left to the **Subtitles** icon. Click on it.

Step 7 Among the various setting options, you need to choose the screen and find the one with the label "Lower Subtitles (Mother Language)". You need to click on its field and select the "Upload Subtitle" option.

Step 8 You will see a pop-up window at the top of the screen where you need to click the "Choose File" button.

Step 9 You then need to navigate to the directory on your computer where you have downloaded the subtitles file, select it, and click the "Open" button.

Step 10 Click the "Okay" button to upload the subtitles to Netflix.

Step 11 Close the settings window and play the video. You can view the uploaded subtitles at the bottom of the player.

## Method 2\. Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Extensions

If you're not a Netflix Premium user, you can still add subtitles to Netflix with the help of certain browser extensions. We'll list them down and discuss the steps for using one of them; the basic steps for using all such extensions are pretty much the same.

### 1\. Substital

**Supported web browsers:** [C](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en)[hrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/substital/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/substital-add-subtitles-/dkkffblkjnedaekodhiblomkicklmjnp?source=sfwOPERA)

Substital is among the most popular extensions that allow you to add subtitles to several online on-demand video streaming platforms, including Netflix. It has more than 100K users on the Chome Web Store.

**Key Features**

Step 2 Open Netflix on the same browser and log in to your account.

Step 3 Play the movie or episode from a TV series for which you want to add custom subtitles.

Step 4 Download the subtitles file for the same movie or episode in your preferred language from the web.

Step 5 Now open the extensions menu in your browser and click on the Substital icon.

Step 6 You will see the name of the movie or TV show that you are watching on Netflix. Click on it.

Step 7 In this step, you need to drag and drop the subtitle file from your system (that you downloaded earlier) to the browser window.

Step 8 Finally, you can notice that the subtitles are loaded in the Netflix player.

### 2\. Super Netflix

**Web browsers:** [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-netflix/iakpdiefpdniabbekcbofaanjcpjkloe)

![new project of wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-2.png)

##### Step2 Make the structure of your graphics

For creating anything, we first need a flawless structure. Here, we can make the structure of Subscribe channel graphics using different colors, icons, texts, and channel photos. We'll start by adding color layers.

**1\. Add color layers**

* Go to the "Media" on the top left corner of the interface and Click on "Sample Color." Here find the Green color and add it in the panel below as the first video layer by the drag-n-drop function.

![adding a bright green color layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-3.png)

* We will key this layer at the end, so make sure not to use any other green graphics for your animation.
* Let's lock this layer because we will no longer use it. For this, click on the "Lock" icon on the layer's left side.
* Add white and red colors and stack them on top of the green color layer.

![white and red color layers added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-4.png)

After adding all three color layers, it's time to crop these layers to make the structure of our graphic.

##### **Crop the Color Layers**

* Go to the "Effects" tab from the top bar and search for the "Crop" effect. Then drag the effect and add it to the white and red layers on the panel.

![adding the crop effect on color layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-5.png)

* First, click on the "Eye" icon beside the red color layer to hide it. Then double-click the white layer to see its properties. When the properties appear, select "Effects" from there.

![cropping the white color layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-6.png)

* You can also enable the safe zones from the display settings on the right side of the panel. After that, crop the white layer first, then show the red layer and crop it too. It will look like this.

![enabling the safe zones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-7.png)

That's it, folks. Our color backgrounds are here. Now we have to add our channel photo to this. So let's move on to see how to do it.

**2\.** **Add a channel photo**

* To add the channel photo, you can upload the image. Here we are going to use some images from the stock media. No matter the image, drop it down on the panel above the red color layer.

![adding an image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-8.png)

* Now double-click on the image layer, and from the properties, go to the "Mask" option and select the circle. You can also select any other shape you like.

![select a shape for our image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-9.png)

* After that, scroll down and make the circle even by matching all numbers. Then scale it down and place it on the left corner of the white layer.

![adjusting the channel image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-10.png)

It's done. Let's add our channel text now.

**3\.** **Add texts**

* For adding text, go to the "Titles" from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.

![adding the channel text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-11.png)

* Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.

![editing the channel text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-12.png)

* Now, let's add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.

![subscribe button text added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-13.png)

We can't finish our structure without icons, can we? So let's move on to them.

**4\.** **Add icons**

* Hit the "Element" from the top bar and search for the "Bell" icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.

![adding a bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-14.png)

* Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.

![adding a freezeframe of the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-15.png)

* You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the "Subscribe" text.

![adjust the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-16.png)

* Similarly, add "Thumbs Up" and "Mouse Cursor" icons on the panel.

![thumbs up and mouse cursor icons added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-17.png)

Finally, our structure is finished. Now let's start animating.

##### Step3 Animate the graphics

First, we'll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.

* Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the "Animation" option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking "Add." Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.

![adding a new keyframe on the white color layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-18.png)

* Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.

![successfully animated the graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-19.gif)

* As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let's correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the" Type Writer' form and hit the "Advanced option.

![selecting type writer style for text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-20.png)

* Here, you can adjust the text with the color layers.

![adjusting the speed of the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-21.png)

* After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.

![the speed of the text adjusted](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-22.gif)

If you've managed so far, then that's great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let's see it in detail.

##### Step4 Animate the mouse cursor

* Go to the "Mouse Cursor" icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the "Thumbs Up" so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the "Mouse Cursor" icon on the subscribe button text.

![adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png)

* Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the "Mouse Cursor" icon on the "Bell" icon.

![mouse curson on the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-24.png)

* The last keyframe we have to add will place this "Mouse Cursor" icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving "Mouse Cursor' icon according to your taste.

The final product up till now will be like this.

![successfully animated the mouse cursor icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-25.gif)

We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let's dive right into it.

##### Step5 Animate the graphics out

The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here's how it's done.

* Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.
* Now, from the "Animation" option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.
* After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,

![removed the white color layer from the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-26.png)

* Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.
* After it's done, the whole graphics will look like this.

![animated the color, image, and icons layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-27.gif)

* The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the "Advanced" settings, just like before.

![click on the advanced option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-28.png)

* From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it's done, we will do the same for the "Subscribe" button text.

![adjust the text with your graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-29.png)

Finally, our graphic is completed. "Export" it from the software to your computer.

![completed subscribe channel graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-30.png)

Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the "Green Screen" option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that's all.

### Step 3: Changing the Distortion Control

### Step 5: Animating the Glitch Effect

To animate the glitch, use the playhead on the top and drag it to the first position where the effect should start from. Hit the stopwatch located on the left of "Master Amplitude." It will create a keyframe. Alter the "Master Amplitude" to 0 as we do not want the clip to begin with a glitch.

### Step 6: Playing with the Playhead

Now, use your keyboard's right arrow to move the playhead three frames forward. After that, set the "Master Amplitude" to 100\. Again, move the playhead three frames forward and set the "Master Amplitude" to 0\. The animation is produced on the RGB color distortion.

### Step 7: Positioning the Video

Move back to the first keyframe and head to the top that shows "Scale" settings. Enhance the scale value so that the video position can be leveled. Click on the stopwatch next to "Position" to create a keyframe. Move the playhead one frame forward and adjust the position of the frame.

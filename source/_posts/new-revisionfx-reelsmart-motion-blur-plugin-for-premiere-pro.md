## Goal of a Video Introduction to Follow

Making intro video is not just only in doing a YouTube channel but you can also use this guide for any businesses like brand presentation, educational etc.

Step1 Start by introducing yourself.

Step2 Get into details.

Step3 Add a call to action.

Step4 Add personalization to your video.

Step5 Video Length.

### 1\. Start by introducing yourself

You can always start your intro by introducing yourself but don't just state your name and what

you do, tell them why you do it, what your core values are and what motivates and dives you to

do this kind of career. Because you all know doing vlog on YouTube is a job, work, and a career.

Share emotions with your audience, and help them relate to you. Doing so is going to help you stand out immediately from the crowd and get audiences interested enough to watch the remainder of your video's content.

### 2\. Get into details

Tip is always direct to the point, add a few facts about yourself, like your interest or previous experiences or who you are as a person. If you are a business owner and would want to talk about your business you can always share how it started.

If we are talking about the YouTube intro video. Every good YouTube intro video usually includes beneficial information for subscribers and viewers. Add any short important text that you feel is necessary from the video titles, your YouTube channel name, and social media handles. Keep your informative text in a consistent format and branding style.

### 3\. Add a call to action

if you have successfully maintained the interest of your viewer until the very end of your video, use this opportunity to invite them to engage with your content more. It's worth including a call to action in each video. Take a full advantage of YouTube to provide your audience with your social media channels and maybe a link or two to your other videos that might interest them,

### 4\. Add personalization to your video

Even though an intro can be more than logo animation, the latter should still be a part of it. Otherwise, there's a sense that something is messing. Include eye catchy visuals effects to your videos to stands out, so that people can easily remember your YouTube channel.

![personalize youtube intro video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/personalize-youtube-intro-video-filmora.jpg)

### 5\. Video length

A long intro, even if it's spectacular, can get boring once your audience has seen it a few times. An ideal length for intros is up to 8-10 seconds only. Just enough time to deliver your message and branding, and hook audiences in for the rest of the video. Any longer than that, and you might lose viewers who are waiting to see the video that they clicked on.

In the era of social media, tempting distractions and short attention spans, it's critical to keep your content as short and sharp as you can.

![tap on desaturate option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-1.jpg)

![disable channel r](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-2.jpg)

Step 3: Now, it's time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left/right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.

![add first glitch element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-3.jpg)

Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool.

It has all the basic video editing features that you need for a project of this magnitude including the ability to merge videos and apply filters.

This makes it the most ideal tool for creating AMVs since you typically need to break a file into various sections for your AMV. You can then add audio to the video and choose one of the effects and filters to add to it. Once the video is complete, you can then export it in 4K resolution or upload it to YouTube directly.

**Sony Vegas**

But perhaps the best feature that Final Cut Pro has when it comes to creating and editing AMV videos is the ability to organize and crop videos easily. The “Compounding Clips” feature, in particular, will come in handy when combining footage, soundtracks, and effects into one perfect AMV.

##### Step1 Upload the video clip

First, you can upload your video clip present on top that you wish to add text animation.

* Tap on the "Upload section" on the bottom left. You can upload your video where you wish to add the animated text.
* The video will get uploaded to "My Files."
* Click on the uploaded video in the library to load it on the workspace.

##### Step2 Add text to the video

* You can add text in their text section
* In the next section, one can find two different text types. At the top, you will discover plain text options, and at the bottom, you can find pre-designed boxes seasoned at Animaker.

Let's see how you can use pre-built text boxes.

* Tap on pre-built designs for your text animation. One can see the text appearing in the center of the workspace, and you can click it and type new text if you want to customize it.
* You can notice widespread options appearing with your text. It is known as the item menu. It will allow the user to modify their text. One can change font size, color, style, etc. Your text will come with pre-defined effects, which will help you to animate text instantly.
* You must have noticed that the purple color bar appears on the timeline, representing the duration of the text visible in the video. For example, if you want that text to get visible between 4rth to 8th seconds, then you will have to drag the edges of that purple bar to the same duration.

To see the scene, you must click on the play button on top of the timeline.

Let’s check the other ways of adding animated text to the video. In the previous one, you have seen how you can add text animation using pre-built boxes. Now you will get to know about doing it by using blank boxes.

* Start tapping the “text section”. Select the bank textbox.
* Click on them and then opt to add new text.
* Opt for clicking the cog icon that is there in the item menu.
* You will notice the settings tab that is on the screen's right side.
* You can easily opt for the customization of the text in the way you wish. You can start by modifying the style of the font. One can change the size and color of the font as well.
* Use these options and opt for the application of enter and/or exit effects to text. Now, opt to click on the effect option to get more than 50 options. You can select the effect from there.
* Once the animation effect is applied to your timeline, you can notice the pink part in the bar i.e. purple. This completes creating text animation by using Animaker.

##### Step3 Download the Video

* You can visit the publish option in the right window to download the video.
* Tap on the "download video" option for downloading.

## Conclusion

![tap on desaturate option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-1.jpg)

![disable channel r](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-2.jpg)

Step 3: Now, it's time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left/right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.

![add first glitch element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-3.jpg)

Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool.

It has all the basic video editing features that you need for a project of this magnitude including the ability to merge videos and apply filters.

This makes it the most ideal tool for creating AMVs since you typically need to break a file into various sections for your AMV. You can then add audio to the video and choose one of the effects and filters to add to it. Once the video is complete, you can then export it in 4K resolution or upload it to YouTube directly.

**Sony Vegas**

But perhaps the best feature that Final Cut Pro has when it comes to creating and editing AMV videos is the ability to organize and crop videos easily. The “Compounding Clips” feature, in particular, will come in handy when combining footage, soundtracks, and effects into one perfect AMV.

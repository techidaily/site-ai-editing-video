## Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects

This polished effect can make your video's title stand out and is one of the best ways to create a stunning title for YouTube and Instagram clips. In this article, we will be looking at how to create the gold text using After Effects.

## Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects

Follow these steps to create a gold text effect in your After Effects video project;

Step1Start by creating an environment. To do that just right-click and choose “New Comp” and click “OK” to create one.

Step2Then we need to add fractal noise. To do that, click on “Effects and Presets” and type in “fractal” to choose “Fractal Noise.” You can double-click on it or drag it to the comp.

Step3Once this is done, you will need to do a little bit of housekeeping on the contrast and brightness. Increase the “Contrast” and reduce the “Brightness.”

Then go to the “Sub Settings” and reduce the “Sub Influence” down to zero.

Go to “Transform Option” and decrease the scale just a little bit. Then increase the “Scale Height” just a little.

Step4The next step is to add color to the scene. To do that, right-click on the layer and choose “New > Solid.” Select the gold color and click “OK.” Do the same with the second layer.

Step5Now you want to blend both colors by choosing a blending mode. Hold the “Shift” key and “hyphen” or “=” sign on the keyboard and choose “Overlay.”

Step6To make the color stronger, go to “Layer > Solid Settings” and choose a color.

Step7Go back to “Comp 3.” Right-click on it and select “New > Light” to add a new point of light.

Step8Go back to the project panel to click on “Comp 4” to add the environment. Right-click on the Comp 4 layer and make it an environment layer.

Step9In the options that appear, set “Appears in Reflections” to “Only” and you can then increase and decrease the color saturation until you have the desired result.

To add a gold texture effect to a title on your video, we will first of all need to add a title to the project.

To do that, go click on the “Titles” tab at the top and drag one of the default titles to the timeline.

Once it is in the timeline, double-click on the title and edit it. Type in anything you want to appear in the title.

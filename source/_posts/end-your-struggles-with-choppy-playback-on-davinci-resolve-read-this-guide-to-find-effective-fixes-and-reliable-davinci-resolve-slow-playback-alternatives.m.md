### Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution

In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the "Playback" menu from the top. Then, select "Timeline Proxy Resolution" and pick one either "Half" or "Quarter" options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.

![lower playback resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

### Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on "OK."

### Solution 3: Enable Render Cache

It’s another solution to fix the **DaVinci resolve slow playback**. Render cache is a file that stores the rendered frames and makes the rendering faster. Start by hitting the “Playback” option and choose “Render Cache.” Then, you’ll see 3 options: None, Smart, and User. You should select "Smart" and let DaVinci Resolve pick one clip to be cached.

![enable render cache slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

### Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature

Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.

* **Shutter Speed:** Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.
* **Resolution:** A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.
* **Editing and Timing:** Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.

While it may look complicated, it's actually quite easy to create with a video editing program like Filmora. Filmora's masking feature allows users to create impressive and eye-catching text reveals in their videos. For those looking for a tutorial on how to make text reveal, here's a step-by-step guide to help you out.

## How to add text reveal effect using [Filmora's](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) masking tool

First, make sure the video clips you are using are clear, with the subject moving across the frame. It will help the text to stand out and be more easily seen. Now, follow the step-by-step guides below:

##### Step 1 Add video tracks

You will need three video tracks in order to create this effect, so click the (+) icon above the timeline > Add Video Track and add two more video tracks.

![add video tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 Import the clip to the timeline

Drag and drop your clip onto the first and third video tracks of the timeline. Then, align them with each other.

![import the clip to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-2.jpg)

##### Step 3 Make a cut at the beginning of the text

Find the spot where you want the text reveals to start, then click the scissor icon to make a cut on the clip from the first video track.

![make a cut at the beginning of the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-3.jpg)

##### Step 4 Add and adjust the text

Go to Title > Plain Text > select which text styles suit you best. Then, drag the title to the second video track.

![add and adjust the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-4.jpg)

Double-click on the title clip and type out your text. Then, adjust the text position and align it to the cut you have made.

![double-click on the title clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-5.gif)

##### Step 5 Use the masking tool

![double-click on each of the smaller clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-8.jpg)

Since the subject in this tutorial is moving from side to side, we are going to match the mask's y-axis setting, which is also the revealed text portion, with the subject's movement. Starting from the first clip, adjust the y-axis number to a smaller/bigger number.

![adjust the y-axis number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-9.gif)

![make more cuts on the top latter clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-7.gif)

Double-click on each of the smaller clips and find the mask settings.

![double-click on each of the smaller clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-8.jpg)

Since the subject in this tutorial is moving from side to side, we are going to match the mask's y-axis setting, which is also the revealed text portion, with the subject's movement. Starting from the first clip, adjust the y-axis number to a smaller/bigger number.

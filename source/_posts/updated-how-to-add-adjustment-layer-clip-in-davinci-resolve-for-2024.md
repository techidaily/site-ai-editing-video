## Edit the title and click snapshots

Then, you should drag the title clip you added to the timeline to an upper section and click on the Media tab following that.

Remember how you clicked on the hide button for the second snapshot for title 2? Now, you have to click on the unhide icon beside it.

Press the Add button to insert a keyframe here and change the scale and position of the title at this point. Move it to the placement you want, right above the lens flare.

## How to Add Font Effects to Videos

Adding titles and texts to a video clip during the post-production phase is a common thing. You may need to add texts in the intro and outro of the video as well as to highlight important parts in the middle of the video. Showing regular and static texts and titles is very unappealing, and that is why everyone includes font effects to animate the texts.

There are different types of font effects available to apply to the texts and titles in your video. There are premium video editors available with a wide range of effects such as After Effect font effects. If you are an occasional video creator, you can use online font effects while you edit your videos on the go. We will illustrate how to add font effects to videos on any device.

Adding font effects on video is a common practice especially when you have intro and outro in your video clip. Instead of the regular titles and texts, you should opt for creative font effects so that the text parts on your video look attractive.

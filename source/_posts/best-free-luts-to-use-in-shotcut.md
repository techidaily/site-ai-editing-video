## Part 1: What is the Adjustment Layer in After Effects?

The adjustment layer can save you time and energy from adding effects to multiple clips individually. It does not alter the composition of your video clip until you start applying the effects. Once you add the effect in the adjustment layer, it will replace the effect on all the layers under it.

You can add the adjustment layers in your timeline for creating visual effects such as film grain or color grading. Using the adjustment layer, you can produce transition effects by adding effects to shorter compositions. However, if you want to use the adjustment layer properly, you should select its position carefully in the layer’s stack.

### Plan your video

Ask yourself first of what you are trying to accomplish by producing the video. Remember that video is a tool and that it can hurt your channel if you don’t take it seriously and come properly prepared. Get organized and take down note if you have to.

Understand your target audience you need to know who you’ll be speaking to through your video content. Make sure that you really understand what you are doing, by this kind of video content is in need your expertise. You have to share to your audience what your knowledge and experience about your video topic. This is the time where its ok to make or create a script and to map out a storyboard to guide you.

### Write a script

Making a script in your video is one way guide for you not to rattle or messed up everything, for me DIY vlog is different from product reviews or unboxing vlog. You can either write a word-by-word script for the video or just the general topics you aim to cover in the video. Either way, the point is to have a reference note so you don’t accidentally forget to cover an essential topic when you begin filming the video. DIY vlogs need to plan and make scripting because this is a more on tutorial video and you don’t like to missed one instruction on your video that is why making a script is a must unless you already doing it over and over again. You don’t have to be perfect and you don’t have to memorize any script. You just have to be relatable and authentic, yet professional.

### Make You Video Short but full of information

Make your video short but demand more attentions to your viewers because modern viewers have short attention spans specially when they’re on social media and there is always another video to see. Just make sure to grab your viewers attention by creating a catching footage.

As long as you know well your topic then that’s good enough because it take some guts to get in front of the camera and be confident.

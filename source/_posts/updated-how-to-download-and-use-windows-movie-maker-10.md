## Dubbing Videos With Voiceovers | Using Wondershare Filmora

Voiceovers have been a great utility in the digital ecosystem for a while. From movies to videos, the use of voiceovers has provided content creators with new dynamics. While it has enhanced the quality of video creation, there are other technicalities that have arisen against it.

## Part 1: What is The Difference Between Voice Recording and Voiceover?

Do you know **voiceover** and voice recording are two different terms? They are often used correspondingly but have different meanings. Here are a few differences between the two in the section below:

**Voice Recording**

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations. Ultimately, we can say that voiceover is a part of voice recording that should be synchronized with the visual media to fulfill its purpose.

1. Open the software and click "Capture." You can set various specifications, including the audio settings for your recording and the recorded area.

3. Click on F10 to stop the recording. The program will save the file on your PC.

##### Step2Choose Background Music that Fits Your CSGO Montage

The capability of music conveying emotions, authentic interactions, and a sense of realism is crucial to the viewers' watching experience. It holds the attention of viewers and makes them want to continue watching your gaming montage.

Make sure the music you choose fits the theme of your CSGO montage video. The right music will provide a constant through-line that ties numerous CSGO gameplay clips together. What's more? It can lend your montage a level of professionalism while giving it a polish.

Only use royalty-free music in your montage video, as this means you won't pay any ongoing royalties when you use the music track. There are loads of royalty-free music libraries online, where you can find non-copyrighted montage music. These include StoryBlocks, FreeSound, and SoundCloud.

Once you've found the music you like, download it and use it in your CSGO montage video.

##### Step3Download Video Editing Software

You'll need video editing software to put your series of CSGO gameplay clips together and make a montage video. While you'll find numerous desktop-based video editing programs available, choose the best one.

A reliable video editing software should be user-friendly. The last thing you want is to get a video editing program that will make you spend months trying to learn how to edit your first montage video.

Pick a program with video editing templates; this will allow you to create CSGO montage videos swiftly because you only have to substitute the existing placeholder media with the content you are making. It should also have special effects and music.

If you're tired of the plain and common video editing effects, check out Filmora. This video editing software has tons of cool effects that you can add to your CSGO montage videos.

## Why We Need to Add Effects to Our CSGO Montage

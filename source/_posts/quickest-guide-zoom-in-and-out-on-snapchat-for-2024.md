When it comes to clip editing, Adobe After Effects is a tool that no one can miss as it has plenty of editing tools and features that other tools do not have. In addition, AE offers a layer-based editing tool that provides the most professional way to edit videos, whereby users can add transition, multiple layers, effects, audio, etc., at the same instant.

03 [Compared with Filmora, What Are the Advantages of Freeze-frame After Effects?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

![how to freeze-frame in After Effect 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tips-to%20freeze-frame-in%20after-effect-2.jpg)

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

![how to freeze-frame in After Effect 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tips-to%20freeze-frame-in%20after-effect-3.jpg)

Thus, you successfully used the **After Effects Freeze Frame** to bring cinematic effects to your video.

## Part 2 **FAQs on Freeze Effect on After Effects**

Now, let us view some common FAQs that may come across while using **After Effects frame hold.**

**●** **What does freeze do in After Effects?**

With After Effects holding the last frame (freeze-frame), you can instantly add multiple layers, effects, transitions, audio, and other media. In addition, the **freeze-frame in After Effect** pauses or stops the specific frame that you want to feature or focus.

**●** **Why can't I freeze-frame in After Effects?**

The reason you cannot **freeze-frame in After Effect** could be a result of the greyed-out features. With this grey-out feature, a freeze-frame cannot be created or added from a sequence, as you will be required to go back to the original clip to create a freeze-frame or any other type of Effect.

**●** **How do you Freeze the current frame for the duration of the layer in After Effects 2020?**

Other Advantages of Freeze-frame in Adobe After Effect is that:

**●** The images can be worked upon quickly without discussion or rehearsed and planned.

**●** They are instrumental as an immediate way of communicating ideas or telling a story.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up.

In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

## Leveraging the Vectorscope for Better Color Correction in Premiere Pro

Our eyes process colors differently. When two people look at the same picture, they may see different shades of colors. In post-production, Vectorscopes help to color grade and make sure you get your images exactly right. This means that you will process the exact color that you want across devices. **Premiere Vectorscope** is a great choice for anyone looking to correct and grade colors. Using Vectorscope Premiere allows you to get quantitative data about your image for a more accurate assessment of colors within the film. In this article, we explore what comprises Premiere Pro Vectorscope and how to use them in video editing.

**Color Correction Editor** An easy-to-use video editor helps you make color correction and color grading experience for videos ![Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Use Vectorscope in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try Color Correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## **Part 1\. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read**

Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.

The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-1.JPG)

Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.

### **How to Read a Vectorscope**

Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.

![reading vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-2.JPG)

The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.

Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.

Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.

## **Part 2\.** ** Vectorscope in Premiere Pro

Just like many other video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro offers Vectorscope to help in post-production. The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.

The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:

### **1\. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro**

A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-3.JPG)

As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.

![drop-down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-4.JPG)

### **2\. Adjusting Skin Tones**

A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.

![skin tones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-5.JPG)

The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate

The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.

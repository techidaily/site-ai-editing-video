Either way, the point is to have a reference note so you don’t accidentally forget to cover an essential topic when you begin filming the video.

### Write a script

Making a script in your video is one way guide for you not to rattle or messed up everything, for me DIY vlog is different from product reviews or unboxing vlog. You can either write a word-by-word script for the video or just the general topics you aim to cover in the video. Either way, the point is to have a reference note so you don’t accidentally forget to cover an essential topic when you begin filming the video. DIY vlogs need to plan and make scripting because this is a more on tutorial video and you don’t like to missed one instruction on your video that is why making a script is a must unless you already doing it over and over again. You don’t have to be perfect and you don’t have to memorize any script. You just have to be relatable and authentic, yet professional.

### Make You Video Short but full of information

Make your video short but demand more attentions to your viewers because modern viewers have short attention spans specially when they’re on social media and there is always another video to see. Just make sure to grab your viewers attention by creating a catching footage.

As long as you know well your topic then that’s good enough because it take some guts to get in front of the camera and be confident.

### Editing and Personalize your DIY Video

The last step is the process of editing and personalize your video content. There are a number of great video editing apps and programs out there, and with a quick internet search, you should be able to find one that meet your needs, skills level and budget. Editing is what really takes a video to the next level, use a powerful video editing software.

When it comes to creating a course or video instruction, these two applications are quite quick and useful. Whether you should choose a Camtasia or a Captivate relies entirely on your industry and what you want to accomplish with this application.

Often times between Camtasia vs Captivate, the question arises: "Which software is superior?" As a result, we've compared Camtasia and Captivate based on the software packages themselves, as well as some important features, similarities, and differences. Software stimulation, production, demonstration screencasts, and translation of PowerPoint presentations into various formats are all possible using TechSmith Camtasia and Adobe Captivate. Camtasia offers fewer online learning alternatives, but it boasts incredible screen and video capture, as well as video editing facilities. This application allows you to alter the sound and visual characteristics manually. Video artists may improve video quality by using auxiliary microphones and cameras. The editing of the video is Camtasia's most impressive function. It allows you to cut and paste films, add transitions and subtitles to them, as well as do color grading and color correction.

## Part 1\. Overall Comparison

Each piece of software may be used to create eLearning and lesson material. Despite the fact that Adobe Captivate offers amazing transitional features and visual effect tools, it does not include video editing, which is, in my view, the backbone of developing eLearning material that adheres to the learning management system. As a result, Adobe Captivate needs the use of Adobe Premiere to edit and correct any problems in your films. Adobe Captivate, on the other hand, is the greatest alternative for developing quality eLearning and lesson software material. It's an excellent tool for developing online courses and tutorials. However, as previously said, Adobe Captivate is not simple to use and is not recommended for novices. Camtasia, on the other hand, seems to be the most economical and practical alternative for you based on your abilities if you are an entry-level editor and want to master the fundamentals of video editing and lesson production on your own.

## Conclusion

Camtasia's technique of making a presentation using an individual movie works well for developers who are knowledgeable with video applications. Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that user’s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.

Captivate is an Adobe tool designed to make online learning more engaging and interactive. Students save time since they can take their classes with them. Captivate has no built-in video editing tools. To do so, you'll need to use additional Adobe applications. Captivate allows students to study at any time and from any location. However, if you're the one creating the course, Adobe Captivate could be a little frightening since it requires Adobe experience to utilize.

## Conclusion

Camtasia's technique of making a presentation using an individual movie works well for developers who are knowledgeable with video applications. Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that user’s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.

## 6 Best MP4 Mergers to Join Videos Easily

Not all software allows you to combine videos in the MP4 format. And even if they do, the quality you get is not satisfying. The reason is pretty basic – overrated and underrated video merging software. Some tools are complicated, while others are extremely user-friendly with the interface and options.

So, after spending several days on the research, finally, here are the **6 best mp4 mergers** along with their tutorials to help you understand the process and complexity of each software and pick the best one in terms of simplicity and user-friendliness.

#### In this article

01 [Free Video Joiner](#part1)

02 [Freemake Video Converter](#part2)

03 [Boilsoft Video Joiner](#part3)

04 [Media Cope](#part4)

05 [MP4Joiner by MP4Tools](#part5)

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-52.jpeg)

**Step 3: Fill the Gap to Merge**

When you will drag-and-drop videos on the timeline, the chances are that there will be a gap or a blank space between the two clips, like this.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-53.jpeg)

Among the 6 best MP4 mergers, Filmora seems to be winning. It’s not just a video editor with plenty of tools, but you can also join two or more videos in MP4 format without sacrificing the video quality.

On the other hand, video merges like Free Video Joiner, Freemake, Media Cope, Boilsoft Video Joiner, and MP4 Joiner have limited options. Plus, they are time-consuming, and some of them even disturb the video and audio quality when clips are merged through them.

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

**Step 3: Rearrange Video Order**

If you wish to rearrange the videos, you can do it by simply dragging the video up or down with the help of your mouse.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-15.jpeg)

For example, the “Photo Slideshow” video, which was previously on the top, is now placed beneath the “Intro” video.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-16.jpeg)

That means the merged video will begin from the “Intro” video, and then the “Photo Slideshow” will continue right after the first clip ends. All be done without any break or pause.

**Step 4: Join Videos**

After rearranging the videos, use your mouse to select clips by clicking once on each video. All selected videos will be highlighted in the “light blue” color.

Use your mouse to click the blue “+” icon in the center of the software to import videos from your computer.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-51.jpeg)

Then, drag-and-drop the videos to your timeline. But make sure that you place both clips on the same timeline. As you can see below, there are two clips. The first clip is named “Travel 05,” while the second video is called “Travel 06.”

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-52.jpeg)

**Step 3: Fill the Gap to Merge**

When you will drag-and-drop videos on the timeline, the chances are that there will be a gap or a blank space between the two clips, like this.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-53.jpeg)

If this blank space is left untreated, the merged video will include this empty black space, as you can see on the preview screen.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-54.jpeg)

Therefore, use your right mouse click to hold the second video and drag it to the wall of the first video without leaving any gap in between both clips.

![mp4-mergers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/mp4-mergers-55.jpeg)

## Part 1: Free Video Joiner (For Windows Users Only)

[Free Video Joiner](http://www.freevideojoiner.com/) is a free tool to use for Windows users. You can join multiple videos to turn into a big video file. The software allows you to convert WMV, MPG, MPEG, AVI, and MOV files into MP4, MOV, WMV, and AVI. You can also “Save As” videos in VCD and DVD, iPhone, iPod, Zune, or PSP video formats.

The company claims “no quality loss” when the complete video is out. However, you have to be very picky when selecting the first video in your list to merge with others because the Free Video Joiner keeps the same width and height of the merged file as of the first video.

So, for instance, if you have 10 videos in the list to merge in the MP4 format, the first video has 1280 x 720 dimensions while the rest are 1920 x 1080\. Then, the final merged video will be available to you in the same width and height as the first video (1280 x 720).

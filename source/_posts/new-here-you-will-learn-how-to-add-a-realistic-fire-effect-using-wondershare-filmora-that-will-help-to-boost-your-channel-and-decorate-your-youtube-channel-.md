## Here, You Will Learn How to Add a Realistic Fire Effect Using Wondershare Filmora. That Will Help to Boost Your Channel and Decorate Your YouTube Channel with Creative and Unique Effects

Do you know that many cinema films and big-budget companies use visual effects to create realistic fires? It saves them from potential danger in production and helps them manage the time required to create a project. In this article, you will get pro tips and easy ways to add Fire effects by Wondershare Filmora.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** let's not count Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan productions because their movies have a higher budget, and creating fake fire is easy.

## Part 1\. What do you need to create fire effects?

Using simple tools such as Filmora and visual effects, you can create a realistic fire effect with an easy setup. For filming the effect, we will need

1. A good camera
2. A light source
3. Video editing software - Wondershare Filmora
4. Basic editing skills

However, the light source is key to the fire effects. It will be beneficial if you have a **warmer color** light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use **tungsten** light bulbs or small circular **LEDs** that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.

## Part 2\. How to make a realistic effect fire?

After getting prepared, it's time to do the real things. Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.

##### Step1 Record your footage

While recording the video, you can **slightly shake** your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.

**Shaking the light manually**

Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.

![shaking the light source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-1.gif)

**Shaking the light using a dimmer**

You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a **dimmer**, your work will be more accessible.

A **regulator** on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.

![dimmer for shaking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-2.jpg)

##### Step2 Record the object

Our next step will be to record the object on which the effect is taking place. Ensure the camera is placed under a **good light** source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the **level of the eye** so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.

Also, keep in mind to **zoom out** the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object. The more natural the acting is, the more realistic would be the fire effect.

##### Step3 Edit the footage

We are being safe and saving time by not using actual fire. The **goal** of creating a fake fire would be the effect and reaction of the object or the actor.

**1\. Download a professional video editing software - Wondershare Filmora**

Visit [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) official site if you haven't already downloaded it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** download the latest version of filmora. It will give you a pro version and help you to create more realistic fire effects.

**2\. Create a new project and import the recorded clips**

Before adding the fire effects to your video, you must ensure that you are familiar with the editing software. Your first step would be to add your clips to the **timeline.** Drag the footage from the library and enter it into the timeline.

![import footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-3.jpg)

**3\. create the fire effect more realistic by adding smoke**

The next step would be to add smoke to the fire. As it is only fair that the fire makes the smoke so. Adding the smoke will create the fire effect more realistic. Follow the below steps to get your cinematic video!

##### #Step1 Search for smoke effects

To add the smoke effect, click on the element's icon on the bar above and search for **smokescreen 2.**

##### #Step2 Add a smoke effect

Once you have searched and found the smoke screen 2 effects, then **import** that effect onto your timeline so that you can begin editing.

![adding smokescreen2 effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-4.gif)

Once you've added the fire effect, you will notice the change on the screen in the top right corner.

##### #Step3 Add duration

The next step would be to set the duration of the smokescreen effect so that it **matches the length of the video**. To do so,

* Click on the edge of the smoke screen effect.
* Drag it to the right if the effect appears **smaller** than the video clip.
* And drag it to the left if it is **larger** than the video clip.
* As soon as it matches the length of the video, leave the drag, and it will fit right into place.

##### #Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect

Once you have matched the duration of the smoke screen effect to the video clip, our next step would be to make some changes. These changes will make the **smokescreen appear more pleasing**—**double-click** on the smokescreen effect, which will open the transform menu.

We would first focus on the transform panel. Here you would have many options, but our focus would be on **rotation, scale, and position**.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** make sure to rotate the smoke screen effect by simply sliding the slider or dragging the slider right or left to your desire.

* You would have created an **angle** of the smokescreen to make it more natural.
* Now, we would have to adjust the **scale** of the smokescreen effect.
* Drag the slider to the right to expand the smoke to spread on the screen. It will help the smoke screen do appear more natural.
* You can adjust how much the smoke screen is visible on the screen by decreasing the opacity.

Adjust the slider to the **left** so it blends in with the flickering of the light we created. Now playback the video from the big screen to get an idea of the effect you added. And here are our parameters for reference.

![adjust the slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-5.jpg)

Cool, isn't it? Now we have added smoke to our timeline. Combined with the flickering light effect, we are closer to our goal.

##### Step4 Add flames or sparks

To mimic a real fire, we also have one more element that is missing, And that will be the **sparks and the flames**. And if you want to bring the fire effect of your video to the pro level, we would have to use the **film stock effects.** Flames and sparks are also available in the Wondershare Filmora.

##### #Step1 Search for Fire Tab

![search for fire tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-6.jpg)

* To do so, **click** on the bar above the element's icon.
* Once you have opened the elements tab, look to your **left** window, where further options are available.
* From these options, click on the **fire tab**.
* A new window will **pop up** in the library panel.

##### #Step2 Add the flame to the timeline

Click on a large scale **14** and drag it into your timeline above the smoke effect and the clip. Doing so would have created **two extra layers** after the video tab.

![adding flame effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-7.jpg)

##### #Step3 Adjust the flame effect

Now, we have to do steps similar to the ones above the first job. But first, you have to click on the edges of the effect. Then, match it to the length of your video.

Now, remember if the length of the effect is **more** than that of the video clip. You can adjust it by clicking on the edge and dragging it to the **left**. And if it appears to be **smaller** than the video clip, drag the edge to the **right** to match the length.

##### #Step4 Blend the video

When you look at the effect as you play the video from the start, you will notice that **the effect is a little more intense** than we want. To change it to your desires, you can follow the following steps.

* **First of all,** double-click and open the **transform**
* Experiment with the **rotation** and the **scale** and position; make your choice.
* Then move on to the compositing panel and focus on the **blending mode**.
* Here, you will notice a **drop-down panel** and select the screen option from all the other options.
* Doing so would help you blend the spark effect video much better.

If you focus on the spark effect that appears on the screen, you will notice that it seems to be much more intense than we require. If you want to blend it further, you can use **the opacity adjuster** and decrease the transparency. **Then, adjust** the slider till you feel it to be just right.

And the following are ideal parameters of our adjustment just for you to refer to.

![ideal parameters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-8.jpg)

## Add some Sci-Fi Touch to Your Next Video Content Using Wondershare Filmora Editing Tools to Create an Alternate Reality Effect

Ditch boring one-dimensional videos and create a mesmerizing video with this alternative reality effect you can easily create using Wondershare Filmora.

This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?

Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.

![a preview of the alternate reality effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-1.gif)

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

## Editing the video

If you have your footage or stock video ready, then you can start editing. Follow this simple step-by-step guide to create your own alternate reality using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Step 1: Drag and drop the video footage into the timeline - this will be the bottom part of the scene. Go to **Effect > Utility > Image Mask**. Drag and drop it onto the video footage.

![open the utility menu to insert an image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-2.gif)

Step 2: Adjust the mask by double-clicking the video footage. Go to **Setting > Mask Setting** and choose any shape you like. Set the feather number to 100.

![go to mask setting and adjust the feather number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-3.jpg)

Step 3: Scroll up the **Setting > Transform**. Adjust the position of the video footage on the x and y-axis to ensure that the mask shows the bottom of the landscape view. Click Ok.

![adjust the position using the x and y-axis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-4.jpg)

Step 4: Drag and drop the same video footage onto the timeline next to the first video footage. Place an Image Mask as well on this footage. This will be the upper part of the scene.

![drop the same footage on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-5.gif)

Step 5: Double-click the second footage to open the Setting menu on the top left. Choose **Transform > Vertical Flip**.

![opt for a vertical flip transformation to the footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-6.jpg)

Step 6: Scroll down the Setting menu to find the mask settings. Choose an opposing mask shape for this second footage then set the feather number to 100 as well.

![select an opposing mask shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-7.jpg)

Step 8: Double-click to open the **Setting > Transform**, then, adjust the x and y-axis numbers to ensure that the mask reveals only the top half of the landscape. Click Ok.

![adjust the x and y-axis of the second footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-9.jpg)

You can recheck the preview at this stage and just save it as it is if you're already satisfied with the result. However, if you want a more dynamic alternate reality scene, continue reading to see advanced tips you can follow to make your video looks even more otherworldly.

## Enhancing the effect with rotation keyframes

If you're using stock videos or encountering limitations when making your footage, chances are your alternate reality is not looking as dynamic as you want it to be. Go all out by adding the rotation keyframes to the video footage so that the alternate reality looks more unreal.

Step 1: Double-click the video footage on the first video track to open the **Animation Settings > Customize**.

![open animation settings to customize keyframe rotation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-10.jpg)

Step 2: Move the playhead to the beginning of the first video footage and add a keyframe by clicking on the Add button. Set the rotation of this keyframe at 0 and the scale at 100.

![move the playhead to the beginning and click add](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-11.gif)

Step 3: Now move the playhead to the end of the video footage and add another keyframe. This time, set the rotation to 20 and adjust the scale number to 115.

![move the playhead to the end and click add](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-12.jpg)

Step 4: Do Steps 1 to 3 to the second video footage. Don't forget to preview the result to see if both footages are rotated properly.

![previewing the result](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-13.gif)

## How to Create Datamoshing Effect to Your Footage in After Effects?

Experimenting with new effects and filters has become part and parcel of life, especially for creative professionals. Datamoshing is a similar effect that displays errors and flaws in the video clips to leave an impression on the audience. In most terms, the datamoshing effect shares similarities with the glitch effect.

Henceforth, the write-up shall focus on the introduction of this effect along with its workability. The procedure to create datamosh After Effects would also be covered. So, let us begin!

#### In this article

01 [What is the Datamoshing Effect?](#part1)

02 [How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?](#part2)

03 [Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)](#part3)

04 [How to Do Datamoshing Effect with Datamosh Plugin in After Effects](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Datamoshing Effect?

Before going into the depths of workability and operation of the datamoshing effect in After Effects, let us understand the effect in detail. The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.

In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.

Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.

## Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?

The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.

Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.

The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.

The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.

The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.

## Part 3: Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)

Understanding the datamosh After Effects is one thing, and incorporating it in your footage is another. The section shall walk you through the step-by-step guide to create the After Effects' datamoshing effect without a plugin. So, let's go, shall we?

### Step 1: Preliminary Process

The first step is easy. Open After Effects from your system. Import the targeted video that needs the datamosh effect. After that, head to the "Content-Aware Fill" to begin the process.

![tap on content aware fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Creating the Reference Frame

Use the playhead where you wish to create the effect, and then click on "Create Reference Frame." The picture frame opens in Photoshop, and the user is expected to save it. Now, go back to the After Effects.

![create reference frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Smearing Process

Now, hide the top layer so that the smearing can occur. Turn the Masks to "None" so that you can perform the masking. Split the second layer to duplicate the layer as we make changes to it. Set the "Masks" to "Subtract and then add a refine soft matte.

![ smearing process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-3.jpg)

### Step 4: Pre-composing the Clip

It is important to pre-compose the clip, so right-click on the timeline and hit "Pre-compose" to the menu list that appears. Tick mark "Move all attributes into the new composition" and rename the clip afterward. Hit "OK."

![pre-compose clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Rendering Queue

Double-click on the timeline, hold shift and drag it until the clip snaps. Press "B" on your keyboard and "N" on the other side to snap the work area. Navigate to "File" and "Export" and then click on "Render Queue."

![render queue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-5.jpg)

### Step 6: Generating Fill Layer

Import the file when it is done rendering and drag it to the timeline. Trim the work area again using B and N buttons from the keyboard. Ensure that the fill method is "Surface," and the range is "Work Area." Click on "Generate Fill Layer" to start the analyzing process.

![generate fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-6.jpg)

### Step 7: Creating the Transition

The user is expected to create a transition between the two shots. Use the track matte to make solid and fractal noise. In the "Noise and Grain" section, click on "Fractal noise" and then switch the fractal type to "Basic." Now, keyframe the "Brightness" and simultaneously turn its level to black and white to create a transition.

![create transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Achieving a Glitchy Effect

To give the glitchy effect, head to the "Effects and Presets" and hit "Posterize," and reduce its level to a couple of integers. Pull the transition down to the fill layer and set it to "Luma Matte." It will showcase the halo sign that we masked around the image.

![create glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Have a Finer Imprint

To eliminate it, use the "Set Matte" channel and alter its layer to the one we pre-composed. Now, invert the matte. Moving on, navigate to the "Simple Choker" and reduce it to one pixel. For perfection, duplicate it and get a finer imprint.

![customize simple choker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-9.jpg)

### Step 10: Final Process

Duplicate the grey solid and then extend the second clip to our fill. In the last step, change the layer of the second clip to "Luma Matte" and save the video. You are done with the process.

![change to luma matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-10.jpg)

![use hold frames function](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-13.jpg)

### Step 4: Injecting the Frames

Toggle the "Inject Frames" on and press use previous render. Hit "Datamosh" afterward. In this way, the clip will hold the frames and inject them into the transition. Enhance the intensity of the moshing algorithm and eliminate "Remove Frames" and "Inject Frames." Use the previous render and again hit "Datamosh."

![inject frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-14.jpg)

### Step 5: Playing with the Acceleration

Increase the acceleration and bring the intensity back to what it was. Again, use the previous render and click "Datamosh." Now, improve the intensity and set the acceleration back to 0\. Alter the "Blend" as much you need to mix the original and present motion of the transition. Press the "Datamosh."

![play with acceleration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-15.jpg)

### Step 6: Changing the Threshold

### Step 7: Creating the Transition

The user is expected to create a transition between the two shots. Use the track matte to make solid and fractal noise. In the "Noise and Grain" section, click on "Fractal noise" and then switch the fractal type to "Basic." Now, keyframe the "Brightness" and simultaneously turn its level to black and white to create a transition.

![create transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Achieving a Glitchy Effect

To give the glitchy effect, head to the "Effects and Presets" and hit "Posterize," and reduce its level to a couple of integers. Pull the transition down to the fill layer and set it to "Luma Matte." It will showcase the halo sign that we masked around the image.

![create glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Have a Finer Imprint

To eliminate it, use the "Set Matte" channel and alter its layer to the one we pre-composed. Now, invert the matte. Moving on, navigate to the "Simple Choker" and reduce it to one pixel. For perfection, duplicate it and get a finer imprint.

![customize simple choker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-9.jpg)

### Step 10: Final Process

Duplicate the grey solid and then extend the second clip to our fill. In the last step, change the layer of the second clip to "Luma Matte" and save the video. You are done with the process.

## Part 4: How to Do Datamoshing Effect with Datamosh Plugin in After Effects

With its plugin, this sub-section revolves around creating the datamosh effect in After Effects. So, let us begin!

### Step 1: Rendering the Work Area

Open After Effects and click on the (+) sign to set the in and out points. Click on the "Datamosh" to render the work area. The timeline will showcase the clip. Click on "Remove Frames" from the left panel and add a new mosh marker by pressing the (+) button beside "Remove Frames."

![add mosh maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-11.jpg)

### Step 2: I-Frame Removal

The new remove frame marker will be on the timeline. Drag it to the new scene and then hit "Datamosh." The I-frame removal effect can be shown on the screen. Again, click on (+) to add a new mosh module. Press "Multiply" and then "Average" from the menus that appear. Hit "Average previous 3" afterward.

![i-frame removal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-12.jpg)

### Step 3: Using the Hold Frames Function

Set the in and out points of this mosh marker and again hit "Datamosh." The work area will be rendered. Now, open the mosh module and toggle on the "Hold Frames" feature. Also, toggle on the previous render. Press the "Datamosh" again.

![use hold frames function](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-13.jpg)

### Step 4: Injecting the Frames

Toggle the "Inject Frames" on and press use previous render. Hit "Datamosh" afterward. In this way, the clip will hold the frames and inject them into the transition. Enhance the intensity of the moshing algorithm and eliminate "Remove Frames" and "Inject Frames." Use the previous render and again hit "Datamosh."

![inject frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-14.jpg)

### Step 5: Playing with the Acceleration

Increase the acceleration and bring the intensity back to what it was. Again, use the previous render and click "Datamosh." Now, improve the intensity and set the acceleration back to 0\. Alter the "Blend" as much you need to mix the original and present motion of the transition. Press the "Datamosh."

![play with acceleration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-15.jpg)

### Step 6: Changing the Threshold

04 [How to Do Datamoshing Effect with Datamosh Plugin in After Effects](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Datamoshing Effect?

Before going into the depths of workability and operation of the datamoshing effect in After Effects, let us understand the effect in detail. The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.

In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.

Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.

## Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?

The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.

Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.

The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.

The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.

The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.

## Part 3: Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)

Understanding the datamosh After Effects is one thing, and incorporating it in your footage is another. The section shall walk you through the step-by-step guide to create the After Effects' datamoshing effect without a plugin. So, let's go, shall we?

### Step 1: Preliminary Process

The first step is easy. Open After Effects from your system. Import the targeted video that needs the datamosh effect. After that, head to the "Content-Aware Fill" to begin the process.

![tap on content aware fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Creating the Reference Frame

Use the playhead where you wish to create the effect, and then click on "Create Reference Frame." The picture frame opens in Photoshop, and the user is expected to save it. Now, go back to the After Effects.

![create reference frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Smearing Process

Now, hide the top layer so that the smearing can occur. Turn the Masks to "None" so that you can perform the masking. Split the second layer to duplicate the layer as we make changes to it. Set the "Masks" to "Subtract and then add a refine soft matte.

![ smearing process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-3.jpg)

Step 5

For the next step, you need to download a simple [Vignette png image](https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/ihbooTJ%5Feffect-gfx-png-black-vignette-png-transparent-png/). Then, import the Vignette image into Filmora. Go to **My Media** and click on **Import Media.** Import it and drag the image to the Timeline. Then, move that clip to Track 3.

![vignette png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vignette.png)

Step 6

Drop the **Black** snapshot you took earlier to Track 2\. Double-click on it, go to **Animation**, and apply these settings. After this, move the Playhead to the end of the clip and change the **X-axis** value to “**\-800**”.

![snapshot settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black.png)

Step 7

Go to **Effects** and drag the **Square Blur** effect to Track 4 on the Timeline. Increase its duration to match the other clips. Then, click on the effect and change its **Size** bar value to 4\. Click **OK.**

![add effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/effect.png)

Step 8

Place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip. Go to **My Media** and drag the Black snapshot to Track 5\. Double-click on it → go to **Animation** and change the settings to look like this. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds. Here, change the **X-axis** to “**150”** and the **Scale** to **75%.**

![edit snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black-snapshot.png)

Step 9

Now, place the Playhead at the starting point and drag the colored snapshot in Track 6\. Double-click on it and change the **Scale** to **50%**. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds again and change the **Scale** to **75%.** Click **OK.**

Step 10

Go to **Sample Color** and drag “Gradient 4” to Track 7 on the Timeline. Double-click on it → go to the **Video** tab → change the Blending Mode to **Overlay** → decrease the Opacity to **25%.** Click **OK.**

![gradient sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/gradient.png)

Step 11

Drag a Default Title to Track 8 and double-click on it to open its Advanced settings. From here, delete the yellow text clip located under the video. Then, insert a Line shape.

![insert line shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line.png)

Step 12

Increase the Line’s length to be almost as long as the screen. Then adjust its position until half of the Line is visible on the screen. Like this.

![edit shape in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-line.png)

Step 13

Copy this Default Title and paste it into Track 9\. Open its Advanced settings and change the Line color to something different than the previous one. Then, move it to the other side of the screen, slightly above the previous line. Click **OK.**

![add line shapes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lines.png)

Step 14

Now, select the Default Title on Track 9, double-click it, and go to the **Animation** tab. Move the Playhead at the starting point of the Timeline and add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead to the end of the clip. Drag the **X-axis** position to the right until the Line shape moves all the way to the right side of the screen.

Do the same for the Default Title on Track 8\. But this time, drag the **X-axis** position toward the other side. When you’re done, press **OK.**

![animate shapes filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line-move.png)

Step 15

Go to the **Effects** tab → drag the **Luma Sharp** effect to Track 10\. Click it and change its **Intensity** to **10.**

![add luma sharp effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/luma-sharp.png)

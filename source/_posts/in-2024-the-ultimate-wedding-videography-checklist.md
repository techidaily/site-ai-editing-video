## Wedding Videography Checklist

### 1\. Get to know the couple

As a wedding videographer, it's important to get to know the couple you're working with. This will help you better capture the essence of their wedding day. Spend time talking to them, learn about their relationship, and find out what is important to them. By doing this, you'll be able to create a video that truly reflects who they are as a couple.

### 2\. Understand your videography style and skill level

Wedding videography can be done in a variety of styles, depending on your skill level and interests. Some videographers prefer to stay in the background and capture everything as it happens, while others like to get more involved, interviewing the couple and capturing special moments. It's important to understand what style you feel comfortable working in, and what the couple is looking for in a video.

If you're just starting out, it might be a good idea to stick to a more traditional style of videography. This will help you get the hang of things and build your skills before trying something more adventurous. However, if you have a lot of experience and are confident in your abilities, you may want to try something more creative. Be sure to discuss your ideas with the couple beforehand and make sure they're on board with what you want to do.

### 3\. Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment

Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment. Some venues may have restrictions on where you can set up your gear. If this is the case, be sure to work out a plan with the venue beforehand so that there are no surprises on the day of the wedding.

### 4\. Find out what equipment is needed

To be a successful wedding videographer, you'll need some basic equipment. This includes a good-quality video camera, tripod, microphone, and lighting. It's also a good idea to have some editing software on hand in case you need to do any post-production work. Be sure to discuss your needs with the couple ahead of time and make sure they're comfortable with what you plan on bringing along to the wedding.

### 5\. Get insurance for yourself and your gear

If you're going to be a wedding videographer, it's important to have insurance for yourself and your gear. This will help protect you in the event of an accident or damage to your equipment. There are a number of companies that offer insurance specifically for photographers and videographers, so be sure to shop around and find the best deal for you.

### 6\. Ask for a shot list from the couple in advance

This will help you know what specific shots they are hoping to get on their wedding day. Be sure to discuss the shot list with the couple and make sure you're both on the same page.

### 7\. Alert guests of their wedding video presence

Some couples may want to keep their wedding video a surprise, while others will want to let their guests know in advance that they'll be filmed. If the latter is the case, it's important to alert guests of your presence so that they're not caught off guard by the cameras. Be sure to discuss this with the couple beforehand and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with.

### 8\. Recruit an assistant videographer if you need one

If you're going to be filming the wedding by yourself, it's important to make sure you have all the necessary gear. However, if you're not comfortable doing this or feel like you might need some help, consider recruiting an assistant videographer. This person can help carry gear, set up equipment, and make sure everything is running smoothly on the day of the wedding.

### 9\. Have some backups on hand, just in case

Wedding videography is a big responsibility, and things can sometimes go wrong. Be sure to have some backups on hand, just in case. This includes extra batteries, memory cards, and cables. It's better to be safe than sorry, and having these backups will give you peace of mind knowing that you're prepared for anything.

### 10\. Arrive early to set up and test your equipment

This will help ensure that everything is working properly and that you're familiar with your surroundings. It's also a good idea to do a sound check to make sure the audio is coming through clearly. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to set up and test your equipment before the wedding begins.

### 11\. Capture both the big and small moments

While it's important to capture the big moments, such as the ceremony and speeches, don't forget about the smaller ones as well. These can often be just as special, if not more so. Be sure to keep your camera rolling throughout the entire event so that you don't miss a thing.

### 12\. Have fun

Wedding videography can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. Be sure to enjoy yourself and have a good time while you're working. This will come through in your final product and the couple will be sure to appreciate it.

On the other hand, Wondershare Filmora is a video editor. It gives you tools that enable you to create original videos and enhance them. Therefore, it is the better option if you want to be a YouTuber or renowned video maker.

That said, the best use case for VLC is using it to play videos and music. It's also a great free media converter. Meanwhile, Wondershare Filmora is better suited for video content creation. The tools it provides you with allow the creation of videos that are sure to captivate your audience.

## Conclusion

Merging audio and video is easy. VLC and Wondershare Filmora are fantastic tools that can help you with that task. Suppose you want to do more than just merge audio and video. The latter is the better option. It includes powerful video editing tools that help you create amazing videos. Aside from merging, Filmora also offers audio synchronization, auto beat sync, audio detaching, and more. These features ensure the output file will be of high quality.

## Don't Make These Mistakes

Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.

Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires "persons with a thick skin."

Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:

#### 1\. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor

Almost every videographer and colorist's goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.

Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.

Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.

#### 2\. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage

One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.

Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.

The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.

#### 3\. Imbalancing the Shadow

Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.

This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.

#### 4\. Overusing LUTs

A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.

When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.

#### 5\. Having Limited break

Having enough break enables one's eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.

Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.

## 8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video

When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.

For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.

#### 1\. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation

The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17\. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.

The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.

Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.

#### 2\. Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones

Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.

With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

#### 3\. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment

A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.

When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

#### 4\. Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment

Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.

Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

#### 5\. Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity

Even though you can change your footage to black and white using the hue and saturation functionality, the black and white tool gives you more control.

This functionality feature can make your footage blend with the soft light part. Besides, it is best to first lower the contrast of your image or video to black and white to be able to highlight the unclear parts.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - change opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-5.jpg)

#### 6\. Use levels to unveil the whites, blacks, and mids of an image

Levels is a functionality feature that displays the blacks, whites, and mids of footage. With this functionality, you can make the highlight parts lighter and the shadows appear darker, which is essential in making cinematic videos.

In the levels histogram, the left slider defines the darkest part, the right defines the brightest part, and the top defines distributions.

In software such as Adobe After Effects, you can set this functionality to automatic or customize it based on your preference.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-6.jpg)

#### 7\. Use Vibrance to control other levels of saturation

The saturation of video footage or a clip can be regulated using vibrance functionality. With vibrance, you can alter the saturation levels of your clip while simultaneously minimizing clippings for the colors to approach complete saturation.

When you want to use this functionality in After Effects, you drag and drop it right on top of your footage – The exact part you want to apply it.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vibrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-7.jpg)

#### 8\. Use a Vignette to fade edges

To increase the point of focus, you need to fade your edges. In color grading, you can only fade your edges with a vignette.

This functionality allows you to center images or certain video parts and make the edges unclear. Your emphasis will be more on the central region.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use a vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-8.jpg)

The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.

#### 3\. Imbalancing the Shadow

Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.

This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.

#### 4\. Overusing LUTs

A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.

When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.

#### 5\. Having Limited break

Having enough break enables one's eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.

Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.

## 8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video

When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.

For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.

#### 1\. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation

The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17\. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.

The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.

Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.

#### 2\. Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones

Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.

With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.

#### 3\. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment

A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.

When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.

#### 4\. Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment

Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.

Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

#### 5\. Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity

Even though you can change your footage to black and white using the hue and saturation functionality, the black and white tool gives you more control.

This functionality feature can make your footage blend with the soft light part. Besides, it is best to first lower the contrast of your image or video to black and white to be able to highlight the unclear parts.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - change opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-5.jpg)

#### 6\. Use levels to unveil the whites, blacks, and mids of an image

Levels is a functionality feature that displays the blacks, whites, and mids of footage. With this functionality, you can make the highlight parts lighter and the shadows appear darker, which is essential in making cinematic videos.

In the levels histogram, the left slider defines the darkest part, the right defines the brightest part, and the top defines distributions.

In software such as Adobe After Effects, you can set this functionality to automatic or customize it based on your preference.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-6.jpg)

#### 7\. Use Vibrance to control other levels of saturation

The saturation of video footage or a clip can be regulated using vibrance functionality. With vibrance, you can alter the saturation levels of your clip while simultaneously minimizing clippings for the colors to approach complete saturation.

When you want to use this functionality in After Effects, you drag and drop it right on top of your footage – The exact part you want to apply it.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vibrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-7.jpg)

#### 8\. Use a Vignette to fade edges

To increase the point of focus, you need to fade your edges. In color grading, you can only fade your edges with a vignette.

This functionality allows you to center images or certain video parts and make the edges unclear. Your emphasis will be more on the central region.

## Bottom line

● Color grading is not a piece of cake. Besides, you should not use it as an excuse for making simple mistakes such as the ones highlighted above. You need to pay close attention when color grading your films, and you will have your video project mapping out its intended meaning.

● Moreover, you need not be a pro to carry out cinematic color grading. You need to follow the above eight tips altogether to apply color grading to your video. You will create stunning video files that leave your viewers' eyes gorged out.

Masking is a powerful feature in After Effects that allows you to hide, reveal, or manipulate specific parts of a layer. Whether creating animations, visual effects, or enhancing your video content, masking can be a valuable tool in your arsenal. However, it can be intimidating for beginners, as it requires a good understanding of key concepts and techniques.

This article aims to demystify masking in After Effects and provide a comprehensive guide on getting started.

So let's dive in and discover the art of masking in After Effects!

![masking in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-masking.JPG)

## Overview of Masking in After Effects

Masking in After Effects hides or reveals certain layer parts, such as an image or video. This is achieved through masks, paths that determine the visibility of specific layer parts. Masks are an incredibly versatile tool in Adobe After Effects, allowing users to cut out and combine elements, create professional transitions, isolate objects in photos or videos, and build shapes, among other things.

Masks in After Effects are made up of two parts: the mask and the fill. The mask controls what is visible, while the fill determines the color or image used to fill the masked area.

By default, when a mask is created, it is set to "inverted," meaning the masked area is visible, and the rest is hidden. However, this can easily be changed by pressing "M" to access the mask settings in the timeline and selecting the invert checkmark. Alternatively, the mode can be changed to subtract.

Overall, masks are an essential tool in After Effects, and it's worth taking the time to learn as much as possible about them. The possibilities are endless, and mastering masks can greatly enhance your projects.

## How to Create a Custom Sequence Preset in Premiere Pro

You've probably heard of Adobe Premiere Pro – it's a top-tier video editing software that's widely recognized in the market. But have you delved into the nitty-gritty of sequence presets? A custom sequence preset is your best friend for maintaining consistency across projects.

It allows users to save specific settings for sequence attributes like frame rate, resolution, and audio settings. Instead of reconfiguring these settings for each new project, a custom sequence preset lets you jump right into editing. Now, how do you create one? Keep reading!

## Part 1: How to Create a Custom Sequence in Premiere Pro

Creating a custom sequence is like tailoring a shirt to fit you perfectly. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do just that:

### Step 1: Displays the New Sequence Window

Begin by launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once opened, navigate to the top menu and select **_File_ \> _New_ \> _Sequence_**. This will open up the New Sequence window, where all the magic happens!

### Step 2: Change the Editing Mode to Custom in the Settings Panel

You'll see several tabs in the New Sequence window, but we will focus on the **"Settings"** tab for our purposes. Click on it.

Here, you'll find the **'Editing Mode'** dropdown menu. By default, it's set to a specific format like **'DSLR'** or **'AVCHD**.' Change this to 'Custom.' This will unlock a plethora of options for you to play with.

**Deep Dive into Settings:**

1. **Frame Size:** Define your video’s width and height. Remember, 1920x1080 is Full HD, and 3840x2160 is 4K. Choose based on your project needs.
2. **Frame Rate:** 24fps is the cinematic standard, but if you're creating content for TV or web, 30fps or 60fps might be more suitable.
3. **Pixel Aspect Ratio:** Stick with **'Square Pixels'** unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
4. **Fields:** Choose 'No Fields' for progressive footage. If you're unsure, this is a safe bet.
5. **Audio Settings:** Here, you can configure the sample rate, among other things. 48000Hz is standard for video.

### Step 3: Give the New Preset a Name and Save It

Once you've customized the settings to your satisfaction, it's time to save this configuration for future use. At the bottom of the New Sequence window, you’ll see a **'Save Preset'** button. Click on it.

A pop-up window will show up, requesting you to provide a name for your new preset. Choose something descriptive so you can easily recognize it later. Once named, click **'OK'**.

Your custom sequence preset is now saved and will appear under the **'Custom'** folder in the **'Sequence Presets'** tab.

## Part 2: Why Custom Sequence Presets are Essential for Efficient Editing

As you delve deeper into video editing, you'll begin to appreciate the little things that shave off minutes from your workflow, allowing you to dedicate more time to the creative process. This is precisely where the utility of custom sequence presets in Premiere Pro comes into play. But why are these presets so crucial?

* **Consistency Across Projects:** If you’re managing multiple projects or a series of videos, having a standard format ensures that all your content has a uniform look and feel. Consistency is a hallmark of professional-grade content. It's not just about the visuals – maintaining a uniform audio quality and format is equally significant. With a preset, you no longer need to remember the minutiae of each setting, ensuring consistency effortlessly.
* **Speed Up Your Workflow:** Every minute you spend adjusting the sequence settings is a minute less you have for cutting, color correcting, audio mixing, or adding those special effects that make your videos pop. Over time, those minutes can add up to hours. By using a custom sequence preset, you can jump straight into the creative part of editing without the preliminary setup.
* **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Have you ever rendered an entire project only to find that the frame rate was off or the audio was set to the wrong sample rate? These kinds of errors can occur when setting up a new sequence from scratch each time. By relying on a preset, you mitigate the risks of such oversights.
* **Personalized Templates for Different Platforms:** Different platforms may have varying preferred settings. For instance, the ideal video format for YouTube might differ from that of Instagram or TikTok. Instead of Googling these settings each time, you can have a custom sequence preset ready for each platform, ensuring your content is optimized wherever it's destined.
* **Ease of Collaboration:** If you're working as part of a team, having standard sequence presets ensures everyone is on the same page. This is particularly handy when multiple editors are working on different segments of the same project. With custom presets, you're not just aligning sequences but also visions.

Incorporating this practice into your editing routine might initially seem trivial, but its benefits compound with time.

## Part 3: Summary

Creating a custom sequence preset in Adobe Premiere Pro isn’t just about streamlining your workflow – it’s about ensuring consistency across your projects.

By saving your most-used settings, you're creating a base template that can be pulled up any time, granting you more time for the creative process.

Adobe Premiere Pro's interface is designed to make tasks like these intuitive, so even if you're a beginner, with a bit of practice, you'll be creating custom sequence presets like a pro.

## Part 1 Tips For Creating An Impressive Slideshow Presentation

To create a unique and engaging slideshow presentation, we have shortlisted some tips that will surely work. Check them as below.

**●** **Have a theme**

First of all, have a theme for a slideshow based on which the other elements can be selected. The theme or the story you want to portray can be based on the target audience and the purpose of creating a slideshow. For instance, if you want to generate sales from your products, create a slideshow that shows the benefits of your products and compares them with others in the same category.

**●** **Keep it simple**

The real purpose of a slideshow presentation is to convey your data or message in a simple manner that can be easily related. Since the slides move one after the other in a slideshow, they should be created in a manner so that the viewer can quickly understand them.

**●** **Keep minimum text**

Though text can be included in a slideshow, keep them to a minimum. A slideshow is a creative presentation having pictures, videos, graphs, and several other elements. So, keep the text whenever necessary and don’t include too much-written content. Moreover, a viewer can relate to and recall the product, brand, or service more through a message rather than a text.

**●** **Include compelling visuals**

## 4 Solutions to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great video editing software that comes with a lot of features. You can easily perform basic editing techniques in a few minutes. It also comes with lots of filters to make your videos pop.

For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:

Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.

You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

For macOS 10.14 or later

**Step 1**: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.

**Step 2**: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.

**Step 3**: Change your aspect ratio. When you launch Filmora, you’re allowed to choose your preferred aspect ratio on the start page.

Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.

You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

**Step 5**: Click "Add". You can load one or more video files. Here, I'll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click "Convert / Save" again.

**Step 6**: Choose your desired output profile type. With VLC, you can resize video to MP4, WebM, TS, and other formats.

**Step 8**: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.

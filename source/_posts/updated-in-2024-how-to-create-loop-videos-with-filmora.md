## Shots recording for loop masking

The first and most crucial step for creating a good loop video is to record perfect shots. Here are the steps to record video shots for loop videos.

### How to create a loop video

Step1 Set your camera or phone on a tripod. Make sure it stands still and does not move.

![set up a camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-2.png)

Step2 Set it so that you have a door on one side and enough room for the subject to walk through the door and move out of the frame.

Step3 Make sure all your outfits are ready.

Step4 Start recording on your camera. Walk through the door wearing the first outfit. Change your outfits and repeat the step with all your dresses. It would help if you kept the camera rolling while recording all these clips. Turning the recording on and off with every shot will result in many small movements.

![extend the frozen frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-7.png)

![lock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-8.png)

Step6 Import the clip again on the second track. And find the sections of the clips where the subject is walking in the video. Cut the remaining part.

![import the clip on the second track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-9.gif)

![second track sections](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-10.png)

Step8 Put the first clip at the start of the timeline and move the playhead to find the frame containing enough room for the second outfit.

![put the first outfit clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-11.gif)

Step9 Move the second outfit to that playhead area.

![put the second outfit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-12.gif)

Step10 Double-click on the clip, go to effects, and choose a single-line mask.

![choose single line mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-13.gif)

Step11 Drag the mask to the point where it shows the outfit on its right side.

![drag the mask line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-14.gif)

Step12 Blur the mask edges by increasing blur numbers.

![blur the mask edges](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-15.gif)

Step13 Click on the add button to add a mask keyframe and move the play head forward until the first outfit leaves the frame.

![add a mask keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-16.gif)

Step14 Move the mask to the left to reveal the entire frame, and repeat the same process with all outfits.

![reveal the frame and repeat with all outfits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-17.gif)

Step15 After finishing all outfits, copy the clip from the first outfit. And paste it on top of all the tracks after the last outfit. And add a mask keyframe to this section too.

![add a mask frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-18.gif)

Step16 Unlock the first track and move the playhead to find the point where the subject with 4th outfit moves out of the frame. Then, cut the remaining part of the freeze frame on the right.

![unlock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-19.gif)

Step17 Now move the playhead to the first frame and find where it coincides with the last part of the final frame. Cut the previous piece.

![move playhead to first frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-20.gif)

## Part 1\. What is a Rotating Video Illusion/Effect

Rotating transition video is a trending feature used by models and influencers. The brands also use this style to record the model's videos in advertisements. It could be any makeup transition or clothing transition video.

![final preview of rotating video illusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-1.gif)

It helps to indulge the audience with your content and show the after and before transitions. You can try this with any object or any character. But first, let's figure out the requirements for rotating effects.

## Part 2\. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect

You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.

### The Subject Matters

To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it's you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:

* The person should get two different costumes.
* All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting
* Show affinity and control of the camera.

![character of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-2.png)

### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.

![smartphone for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png)

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

![filming scenes of second footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-5.png)

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

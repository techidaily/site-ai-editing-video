## Part 1\. What Is A Freeze Frame?

A freeze frame is a specific single frame of the video clip shown repeatedly in the video. It gives the illusion of a static picture. It is used to draw the viewers' attention to the minute details of a specific moment, to set up a powerful narrative, or to introduce your main characters.

### Examples of freeze frames in popular movies

Alfred Hitchcock used the first-ever freeze-frame in his film Champagne (1928). There is a long list of many famous tv shows and movies in which the freeze frame effect has been used since then. But to count a few, three examples are given here.

**1\. Pulp Fiction (1994)**

In the beginning scene of Pulp Fiction, where robbery is about to occur, a freeze-frame effect is used to engage the audience. Later in the movie, it was relieved what would happen next. It was a dramatic pause to draw attention. It is a strong example of the freeze-frame effect.

![pulp fiction's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-2.png)

**2\. The Breakfast Club (1985)**

The ending of Breakfast Club is an iconic example of the freeze-frame effect. With a powerful narration, the freeze frame conveys the movie's central idea to the audience.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![import your video clip and add it to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-6.png)

##### Step3 Apply color correction to the footage

Before we start our edit, let's color correct our footage, so the corrected color is already applied when we take the screenshots.

![apply color correction to your clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Find your first action frame

Next, scrub through the clip to find your first action frame. **For example,** in this video, this is our first action frame.

![select the first action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-8.png)

##### Step5 Take a screenshot of the action frame

Let's head to the camera icon under the preview screen and click the icon. It will take a screenshot of the current frame that the playhead is on the timeline.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![take a screenshot of the action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-9.gif)

Make sure to keep the playhead the same after you've taken the snapshot. You can find your screenshot in the media tab.

##### Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline

Let's drag your screenshot onto video layer 2 and align it on the right side of the playhead. Then extend the screenshot so it lasts as long as your central clip.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![extend the screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-10.png)

##### Step7 Apply masks to the screenshot

Now, double-click on the screenshot. It will open the "Video" menu, then go into the "Mask" menu. Choose a mask shape and edit it so that it only covers where your subject is in the screenshot. **For example,** we choose the **"**Circle" mask shape in this video.

![choose your mask shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-11.png)

If you need help seeing what you're masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![hide the main video layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-12.gif)

Move the playhead forward and clean up your "mask." Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![editing of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-13.png)

##### Step8 Hide the first screenshot

Let's layer a couple more action frames! First, hide the first screenshot so it doesn't appear in your new screenshot.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![hide the first screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-14.png)

##### Step9 Select your second action frame

Then, pick a new frame.

![select a new frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-15.png)

* Click the camera icon.
* Drag the screenshot at the new playhead spot.
* Extend the clip.

![repeat the steps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-16.png)

* Double-click to mask this frame.
* And play it back to make sure it looks good.

## Add VHS Effects to Videos for Free: A 2024 Guide

2023 has ushered in a wave of nostalgia, sweeping across various domains, from fashion to technology. Amidst this, videos have become a powerful medium to relive the past. If you're aiming to infuse your videos with a touch of the '90s, look no further than the VHS effect.

For those who need a quick trip down memory lane, VHS tapes were once the cornerstone of home entertainment. These clunky plastic cassettes captured countless memories, from family gatherings to favorite films and TV shows. While they might be alien to newer generations, they hold a special place in the chronicles of video evolution.

The VHS effect isn't just about mimicking the look of these tapes. It's about encapsulating their essence—grainy visuals, occasional jitters, and that characteristic static. Incorporating these imperfections into today's high-definition videos imparts a distinctive vintage flair. It's akin to applying an Instagram filter to a photo, where a simple touch can transport a viewer back in time. Dive in as we guide you on adding this retro charm to your free videos.

## How to Add Font Effect

Adding titles and texts to a video clip during the post-production phase is a common thing. You may need to add texts in the intro and outro of the video as well as to highlight important parts in the middle of the video. Showing regular and static texts and titles is very unappealing, and that is why everyone includes font effects to animate the texts.

There are different types of font effects available to apply to the texts and titles in your video. There are premium video editors available with a wide range of effects such as After Effect font effects. If you are an occasional video creator, you can use online font effects while you edit your videos on the go. We will illustrate how to add font effects to videos on any device.

## Part 1: What Do You Know About Phantom Camera Company?

Vision Research manufactures a Phantom camera that can be used in many professional fields. This company first came into being in 1950 by the name of "Photographic Analysis Company ."During the initial years, the company produced many cameras that could tackle the need for high-speed photography. However, in 1992, the company decided to create a separate entity to create high-speed cameras that wouldn't depend on photographic film for imaging.

The US Patent Office acknowledged the use of innovative technology in the Phantom high-speed cameras. The main aim of this company is to produce robust cameras that can capture faster frame rates in high-speed photography. Many industries like defense, academia, and science research use **Phantom slow-motion cameras**. They are used in microfluidics, transparent flows, imaging, etc.

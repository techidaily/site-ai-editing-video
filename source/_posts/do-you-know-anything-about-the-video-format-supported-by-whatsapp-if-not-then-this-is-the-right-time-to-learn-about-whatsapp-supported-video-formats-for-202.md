## **Wrapping Things Up**

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video.

So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

Step9 Then click **Export** and choose **Create Video**. Let's name it **freeze frame 1** and click on Export.

![selecting create a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png)

It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, **Right-Click** on the timeline and **Cancel** the selected range.

![exporting the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-011.png)

Step10 Import the **Freeze Frame 1** to the media folder and replace the **Freeze Frame + Paper Photo** with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.

![replaced the freeze frame and paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png)

Step11 Now let's make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop **Clip 2** onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip's first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the **Alt+F** keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a **Cut**.

![adding clip 2 to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-013.png)

Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.

![adding paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png)

Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting **IN and OUT** points as we did before. Press the **I** key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the **O** key.

![selecting in and out points](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-015.png)

Step14 This time use the shortcut **Control + E** to open the export window. Again, let's name it **freeze frame 2** and then export it.

Step15 You can use the keyboard shortcut **Shift + X** to cancel the selected range. Then import **freeze frame 2** into the media folder and replace the freeze frame + paper photo. Adjust the length of this new clip to about 1 second.

![replaced the freeze frame and paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-016.png)

Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the **Transitions window** and find Evaporate 2.

![select the transition effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-017.png)

Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between **clip 1** and **freeze frame 1** and the cut between **clip 2** and **freeze frame 2**. You can also adjust the length of the transition.

![dropping the transition effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-018.png)

Step18 Then, find **Torned Paper Transition 4** in the **Transitions window**. Drag and drop it to the cut between **freeze frame 1** and **freeze frame 2**. Then choose **Prefix** mode in the transition setting video. Adjust the length if needed.

Finally, it's done. Let's play the video and see how the paper effect and transitions enhanced the video.

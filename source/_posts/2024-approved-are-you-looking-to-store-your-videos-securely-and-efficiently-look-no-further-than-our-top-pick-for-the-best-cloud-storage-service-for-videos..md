## Part 1: No.1 Flicker

Flickr is an online image hosting and video hosting service that has been around for a long time. However, SmugMug now owns it, and you can access photos and videos from Flickr without registering an account.

### Flicker Free Storage Policy

Flickr is a great **online video storage** service, but it can be limiting if you want to store many pictures and videos. For example, a Flickr free account can only store 1000 photos and videos, which means it can only hold about 2-3 GB of data.

However, you can get around these limitations by storing the maximum allowed file size (e.g., photo files are limited to 200 MB and video files are limited to 1 GB). Additionally, if you want to share photos and videos with others, you'll need to **upload video to the cloud** or use the Flickr app on a device.

Overall, Flickr is a great online photo and video storage service, but it may not be the best option for you if you're looking for a lot of space or want to share photos and videos with others.

## Part 2: How to blur Zoom background on Mac

Backdrop blur is the next best thing when a virtual background is unsuitable for a video conference but a consumer still needs privacy. As you can see from the description above, the blurred backdrop is just another style of the Zoom background. Customers may therefore directly adjust it from the Virtual Background setting area. Prior doing anything further, confirm that your MacBook is running the Zoom desktop client (software).

Before your Zoom call on a Mac, follow these instructions to blur your background:

Step1Start Zoom and log in to your account.

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-cloud-login.jpg)

Step2In the next step, Click the "Settings" gear icon in the top-right corner and then select "Backgrounds & Filters" under Settings as shown below:

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-settings-bg-filters.jpg)

Step3Then choose "Blur," and your backdrop will instantly seem blurred. You can also Select Stop Video by clicking the arrow next to it in the list of choices in the bar below the live video. A little list will start to appear. By using the "Choose Virtual Backdrop" option, you may choose a virtual background.

## Part 3: How to Blur Zoom Background on iPhone

The option isn't accessible on all Apple devices since a simulated or blurred backdrop requires more computing power. First, you should visit the Zoom virtual background system requirements page to see whether your device is supported. You should continue using Zoom without a virtual or blurred backdrop if your device doesn't meet the criteria. To manually conceal your backdrop, consider standing close to a wall or sitting in a corner. Here are the instructions on how to blur your backdrop for Zoom meetings on iOS devices. Take these actions:

Step1Launch the Zoom app on your iOS phone in foremost step. To begin or join a new meeting, tap the "New Meeting" or "Join" icon.

## Part 4: How to blur Zoom background on Android

Additionally, Zoom blur backdrops are the ideal option for first video conversations with clients, coworkers, or supervisors. On its Android app, Zoom offers customers the option to blur their backdrop. However, there is a catch: the function can only be activated once the user has entered a meeting. If a virtual backdrop isn't your style on Android, you may choose to blur the background instead. Everything in the backdrop will be blurred, keeping just your picture apparent throughout the conversation. Remember that all of your next meetings will have the blur function turned on. How? Read on.

Step1Only while you're in a meeting can you alter your backdrop. Tap the More icon in the bottom right corner after joining one.

![best ways to blur zoom background for free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/share-zoom-screen-android.jpg)

## Conclusion

For individuals who prefer to obscure their surroundings while on a video conversation, Zoom's blur background function is helpful. The function was added to the video-conferencing app in 2021 and has since gained popularity. The greatest thing you can do is choose a blur out backdrop if you can't determine which of our Zoom background categories would best fit the video chat occasion. These are impartial backdrops that don't necessarily depict any particular environment. They only provide a lovely, unobtrusive background that will take away any possible obstructions during the video connection. Perhaps a professional setting might be too much for a particular video chat, whilst a humorous backdrop wouldn't work. In this situation, a blurred picture backdrop will be the difference between putting little to no effort into your call and being ready to portray yourself in the best possible way.

## Learn How to Make a Gaming Montage - Guide & Tips

The popularity of gaming montage is growing every day in today's pop culture. There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.

We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.

## How to Make a Gaming Montage

You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you'll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.

Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It's much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.

With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.

### 1) Decide Your Montage Story/Type

Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.

Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.

### 2) Record Your Gameplay Footage

The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.

That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you'll capture the moment after interesting things occur.

Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.

## Useful Tips for Making a Gaming Montage

Making gaming montages can help you build a large online community if you do the right thing. When making a gaming montage, there are a few tips that you should keep in mind. They include:

### 1\. Apply Velocity Effects

Adding velocity effects to your montage will help get the attention of viewers. You can couple the transition between scenes with a speed ramping effect.

Include slow motion where there is a gunshot or other big gaming moment. You can then speed up things to quickly move into another scene. You can create these velocity effects in Filmora and make it smooth.

### 2\. Avoid Game Loading Scenes

Do not include game loading scenes or any unnecessary clips in the gaming montage. Your audience does not have the time to wait for the scenes to load because they want to see action fast.

### 3\. Sync Gunshot with Music Beat

Try to match gunshot sounds with beats and rhythms in shooter video games. The beats of the music and the soothing sync of gunshots will catch viewers' attention and your video will become popular among gamers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Add Creative Transitions

You can spice up your gaming montage by adding transitions, especially when you have loads of clips for the montage. But avoid overusing it, as you could confuse your audience with a range of dazzling and glaring transitions.

### 5\. Color Grade the Video for the Mood

Use color grading to your advantage, as it can set the mood of your viewers. You can decide to make some scenes black and white to catch the viewers’ attention.

### 6\. Add Video Vignettes for Special Occasions

You can add dark edges around the corners of your video to highlight action or create a certain mood. For gameplay based on a story, use vignetting to add a sense of nostalgia or as a flashback that shows viewers the past.

You can use Filmora to apply the vignetting effect by heading to Advanced Color Tuning, then clicking the Vignette option. You can then add the vignette effect to the video. Additionally, you can adjust the vignette's exposure, feather, roundness, size, and highlights.

## Best Gaming Montage for Studying

Here are three gaming montages that are good for studying.

### 1\. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

Uploaded by DemixB, the Call of Duty Game Montage uses Jacques Offenbach's Can Can Music track. It's a happy song that has a tempo of 81 BPM. The track has average danceable energy, and it's somewhat danceable.

DemixB set the gunshot in the montage video to the music tune. The track builds up to the climax when the gunshot echoes with the attention-grabbing orchestral explosions.

NEVERMORE \[CS: GO\] was uploaded by Fuze on his YouTube channel, and it has creative gameplay. The gaming montage is based on a story. He did the project with Apel, an artist who designed the Fever Dream series skins in the video.

The basic idea of this gaming montage was that the main game character is a corrupted policeman with purple glowing eyes because he's not human.

When the edits begin, the shape of the main character will shift from CS: GO CT models and turn into his real corrupt CT shape. So that's why his name keeps changing. You can get his real identity by pausing some of the frames and looking at the "Killfeed."

Closing Thoughts:

Gaming montage involves picking and editing a range of video clips, which are brought together to create engaging video content. It consists of the best scenes from gameplay and non-copyrighted background music.

Use Filmora to edit and add effects to your video, including transitions and overlays. Your gaming montage will get more views, hence becoming popular among players.

The popularity of gaming montage is growing every day in today's pop culture. There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.

We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.

## How to Make a Gaming Montage

You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you'll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.

Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It's much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.

With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1) Decide Your Montage Story/Type

Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.

Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2) Record Your Gameplay Footage

The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.

That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you'll capture the moment after interesting things occur.

Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.

Once you've all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer. This program allows you to edit your video clips and add cool effects that will make viewers keep watching.

## Guide To Cropping and Combining Content in Wondershare Filmora [Latest]

Video editing is one of the most essential tasks in a video project. It plays a role in creating videos that leave a lasting impression on your audience. From the initial raw footage to the final product, a video goes through several processes. One vital aspect of video editing is **trimming** and **merging**, which holds great importance for any video project.

The editing process changes the whole narrative of a video by adding more depth and feel to it. Through editing, you can remove unwanted segments, rearrange clips, and much more. Capturing and recording video is one thing, but bringing the best out of the raw files is another. To make your raw footage somewhat stunning, you have to sit in the editing room.

## What is After Effects?

## How to split video clips in After Effects manually

### Import your video into the After Effects timeline

To split your video clip using after effects, the first step is to get the clip into the program. To do this, open the file menu in the top left corner of the After Effects workspace. Select **“** **Import**” from the options on the drop-down menu displayed. This will open up the file explorer for you to select the clip you would like to import into your project. Once you find your video file, click “**OK**” to add it to the project files. Alternatively, you can simply drag your clip from the file explorer and drop it into the Adobe After Effects workspace.

### Create a new composition

To go ahead with splitting your video clip, you will need to create a new composition. This can be done in two ways. The first is to drag the clip from the project browser to the new composition icon on the layer panel. This automatically creates a new composition. An alternate method is to right-click the video and select “**New Comp**” on the menu.

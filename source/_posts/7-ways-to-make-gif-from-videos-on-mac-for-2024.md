Because of its simplicity and ease of use, GIPHY Capture is one of the most popular and well-liked apps for creating GIFs.

**Cons:**

## ● App Notifications are not working properly

## ● Login issues or account related issues

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Giphy Capture**

#### 1\. Once you’ve opened GIPHY Capture - open up your browser, video, or whatever you want to record. Adjust the size of your GIPHY capture frame by grabbing any of the sides or corners and stretching to your desired frame size

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-9.jpg)

After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.

You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.

You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-10.jpg)

1. Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.

1. Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.

1. If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.

### **GIFROCKET**

**Supported OS:** Mac

GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you've downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.

The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.

**Features:**

* Intuitive interface
* Change quality and file size of the outputted file

**Cons:**

* Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket**

1. After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the _Settings_ button. Here you’ll get three fields.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg)

1. Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the _Hours_: _Minutes_: _Seconds_ layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.

1. Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.

1. The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click _X_, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.

**BEST PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC**

### **PICGIF**

**Supported OS:** Mac

PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps' commonly crappy and blurry gifs.

You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It's a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.

### **Features:**

* Support a vast number of file formats
* Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.
* Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.
* Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.

**Pros:**

* The PicGIF software is safe to use
* The support of PicGIF is good

**Cons:**

* Requires OS X 10.7 Lion or later

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF**

1. **Importing**

The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-13.jpg)

## **2\.** **Customization of Pictures**

Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.

Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-14.jpg)

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-15.jpg)

### In the “Effects” menu, you can choose among popular options – Original, Vintage, Marcato, and B&W. After you make your choice, you can set the bars for Saturation, Hue, Exposure, Contrast, and Brightness. These are much like you would find in your standard photo apps

Hit the play button to test your GIF, and if it’s to your liking, click “Create GIF”. It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.

1. **Customization of Videos**

There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99\. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-16.jpg)

This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.

You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.

You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.

1. Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.

1. Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.

1. If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.

### **GIFROCKET**

**Supported OS:** Mac

GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you've downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.

The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.

**Features:**

* Intuitive interface
* Change quality and file size of the outputted file

**Cons:**

* Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket**

1. After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the _Settings_ button. Here you’ll get three fields.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg)

1. Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the _Hours_: _Minutes_: _Seconds_ layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.

1. Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.

1. The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click _X_, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.

**Cons:**

* Requires OS X 10.7 Lion or later

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF**

1. **Importing**

The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-13.jpg)

## **2\.** **Customization of Pictures**

Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.

Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-14.jpg)

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-15.jpg)

### In the “Effects” menu, you can choose among popular options – Original, Vintage, Marcato, and B&W. After you make your choice, you can set the bars for Saturation, Hue, Exposure, Contrast, and Brightness. These are much like you would find in your standard photo apps

Hit the play button to test your GIF, and if it’s to your liking, click “Create GIF”. It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.

By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Giphy Capture**

#### 1\. Once you’ve opened GIPHY Capture - open up your browser, video, or whatever you want to record. Adjust the size of your GIPHY capture frame by grabbing any of the sides or corners and stretching to your desired frame size

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-9.jpg)

After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.

You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.

You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-10.jpg)

1. Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.

1. Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.

1. If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.

### **GIFROCKET**

**Supported OS:** Mac

GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you've downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.

The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.

**Features:**

* Intuitive interface
* Change quality and file size of the outputted file

**Cons:**

* Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.

**Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket**

1. After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the _Settings_ button. Here you’ll get three fields.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-11.jpg)

1. Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the _Hours_: _Minutes_: _Seconds_ layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.

1. Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.

1. The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click _X_, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.

**BEST PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC**

### **PICGIF**

**Supported OS:** Mac

PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps' commonly crappy and blurry gifs.

You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It's a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.

### **Features:**

* Support a vast number of file formats
* Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.
* Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.
* Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.

**Pros:**

* The PicGIF software is safe to use
* The support of PicGIF is good

**Cons:**

* Requires OS X 10.7 Lion or later

**Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF**

1. **Importing**

The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-13.jpg)

## **2\.** **Customization of Pictures**

Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.

Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-14.jpg)

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-15.jpg)

### In the “Effects” menu, you can choose among popular options – Original, Vintage, Marcato, and B&W. After you make your choice, you can set the bars for Saturation, Hue, Exposure, Contrast, and Brightness. These are much like you would find in your standard photo apps

Hit the play button to test your GIF, and if it’s to your liking, click “Create GIF”. It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.

1. **Customization of Videos**

There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99\. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.

![gif-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-16.jpg)

## AI Features of  Filmora - Silence Detection in Videos

Sometimes awkward silent moments can make a video look cringe and boring. Silence in videos can often be a major drawback, making the content dull and unengaging. However, fear not because there are ways to eliminate them and keep your viewers hooked. One effective solution is to utilize certain features that help in removing silence from videos.

**Silence detection** is a feature that lets you detect silence and awkward pauses in your content. It can detect those instances where there is no audio or any significant sound present. By utilizing this feature, you can easily identify and remove these silent parts from your videos. Wondershare Filmora is a tool that offers this AI-powered feature to **remove silence from videos**.

## Part 1: How Can Silencing in Videos Damage It?

Silence can negatively affect videos, making them less engaging and captivating. Many **video silence removers** are available, but first, learn how silence affects video content. Let's explore some of how silence can damage the quality of video content:

### 1\. Loss of Interest

When viewers encounter long silent moments in a video, they lose interest. Silence fails to hold their attention and leaves them craving for something more stimulating. As a result, they may lose interest in the content and look for other videos. This is somewhat discouraging for a content creator. That's why short and meaningful content is what the audience demand.

### 2\. Lack of Emotional Connection

Sound and audio play an essential role in creating an emotional connection with the audience. Silence, on the other hand, fails to start any emotional response. Without appropriate sound effects or dialogue, videos can feel empty and emotionless. The absence of audio elements also fails to establish a connection with the viewer.

### 3\. Breaks the Flow

Silent moments in videos can disrupt the natural flow and rhythm of the content. Viewers expect a seamless progression from one scene to another. However, sudden silences in a video may create frustration for some individuals. It may also lead to a disjointed viewing experience for the viewer. Meanwhile, the audience sometimes couldn't understand the intended message.

### 4\. Awkwardness and Uncomfortable Silence

Silence can create awkward moments in videos, especially when it's unexpected or prolonged. These silent gaps can make viewers feel uncomfortable. The viewer becomes unsure of what to expect or how to interpret the situation. Moreover, awkward silences can detract from the overall viewing experience. It also leaves a negative impression and makes the content less enjoyable.

### 5\. Reduced Engagement and Sharing

Videos that contain excessive silence are less likely to be shared or discussed among viewers. Silent moments fail to generate excitement or spark conversations. In contrast, videos with dynamic audio elements are more likely to capture attention. If your video has long pauses or awkward silent moments, it may not get the expected response.

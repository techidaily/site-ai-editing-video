It is definitely possible Usually, people use video collage makers for this reason. But you can also create an actual photo collage with music as well (no need to use actual video clips if you don’t want to.)

In the end, it all depends on the collage maker you’re using to be completely honest. In this case, the collage maker in question would have to have video editing functionalities advanced enough to allow you to create a video consisting of a picture collage with music Learn more about the different tools that you can check out below as we break down some of the best of the best available

## 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the video makers that we’re going to be introducing is called Filmora. This is a professional editor that’s equipped with just about everything you need for creating high-quality video content. That includes the things that you will need in order to create a **music photo collage**

For your reference, that means that you can use it to create a video showing off a picture collage with music. Usually by making use of the templates provided by the software and uploading your own images (although, in the newest version of Filmora, Filmora V11, there is a ‘Stock Media’ option that includes an endless supply of photographs, videos, music, etc. for adding to your content.)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

## 02 Canva

Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a **picture collage with music**

Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)

## 03 Express It

You can say that "Express It" is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a **photo collage with music** **app** that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.

Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.

## 04 Smilebox

Smilebox is an automatic video collage maker that is capable of turning photographs into a video collage without much input from you It’s the tool to use if all you’re looking for is a quick solution. By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety

It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your **music photo collage**

![Smilebox - Create Pic Collage with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker4.png)

## 05 Fotojet

Next is ‘Fotojet’, which is an online collage maker that is incredibly popular for those that are looking for an easy solution. It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done

Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free **music photo collage** tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.

## 06 Vimeo

Video is a professional online photo editing tool that’s incredibly popular with entrepreneurs. It actually works very similarly with all the other tools that we’ve introduced so far. That means that it comes with templates that you can use in order to create projects, it also comes with a ‘resources’ library that you can take advantage of in order to fill up said projects

As for creating a **photo collage with music** by using this tool. You will need to sign up to start creating, but it’s FREE to try — with some elements locked under the premium version.

## 07 Kapwing

KapWing is exactly what it looks like, it’s an online photo editor The best part about it is that it comes with quick collage layouts that you can use and the usual resources library. The layouts in question are customizable, allowing you to control what your **music photo collages** look like in the end. You also have the choice of creating said collage with photos, videos, GIFs, and music

Similar to KapWing, VEED.IO offers a video collage maker that comes with customizable layouts that you can use to easily create a **pic collage with music**. The program is of course also free to try (though certain elements are locked in the FREE version).

![VEED.IO - Video Collage Maker with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker8.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Collages are a fun way to preserve memories of a fun event with friends and families Traditionally, of course, photo collages were created with printed still images.

**●** Now, however, not only can you create a moving collage (with images, videos, GIFs, etc.) but you can even add music to it

**●** These types of **music photo collage**s are really fun to share with friends and family online. And, these days, there are even digital picture frames that will allow you to display them in your home (and yes, some of these picture frames do come with speakers for playing music)

## Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?

It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist's ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.

You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:

### 1\. Choose an image that you like

It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.

### 2\. Break the image down into single-color sections

This is the part where "careful planning" comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.

### 3\. Obtain the necessary resources

You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.

### 4\. Start building

Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece's complexity.

## Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art

There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.

* Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.
* Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you'll need to make your pixel art.
* Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.
* If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.

### Conclusion

Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.

Like any Minecraft thing you do in-game, you just stack piles of blocks over blocks to do it, except what the player is doing is creating pixelated art, in general in large proportions. In terms of in-game, pixel art really doesn't do much, but it is to be appreciated like any art.

Many players state that Minecraft pixel art is rewarding and realistic in terms of the game.

## Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?

It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist's ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.

You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:

### 1\. Choose an image that you like

It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.

### 2\. Break the image down into single-color sections

This is the part where "careful planning" comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.

### 3\. Obtain the necessary resources

You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.

### 4\. Start building

Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece's complexity.

## Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art

There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.

* Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.
* Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you'll need to make your pixel art.
* Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.
* If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.

### Conclusion

Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.

## A Detailed Guid to Remove Background From a Video in Premier Pro

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the leading video editing software. You can use to create or remove a video's background. Advanced Chroma Key features such as Color Key and Ultra Key make it possible to produce background-free content quickly.

Although both Keys work similarly, many users prefer to use the Ultra key for a better result in the video. This article will explain how to remove video background in Premiere Pro if you are a newbie.

Let's get right to it and start the tutorial!

## How to Use Premiere Pro to Remove Video Background?

Adobe Premiere Pro can remove video backgrounds quickly using the **Ultra Key** feature with the following steps:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser, and download the appropriate Adobe Premiere Pro version for your [Windows PC](https://adobe-premiere.en.softonic.com/) or [Mac](https://filehippo.com/mac/download%5Fadobe-premiere-pro-cc-for-mac/). Next, install the software on your system and launch it from your Desktop or Dock.

Step2 Now, use the **Media Browser panel** in the software to browse the video clips you want to import into the software. Next, right-click on your selected video file in which you want to remove the background and choose the **"Import"** option.

![premiere pro media browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-media-browser.png)

Step3 Click the **"Effects"** tab in the software panel and select Video Effects. Here, you will see the **"Keying"** option; select the **Ultra Key**, press and hold it to grab the key, and place it on your video clip.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can also search for the Ultra Key in the Adobe Premiere Pro search bar. Drag it to the video clip containing a background you want to remove.

Step4 As soon as you drop the Ultra Key to your footage, an **Effects Control panel** will pop up. Next, use the **eyedropper tool** in the Effects Control panel. Finally, select the background color on your video that you want to remove.

![premiere pro effects control panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-effects-control-panel.png)

Step5 In the next step, click the drop-down menu next to the **"Output"** option, and select **"Alpha Channel"** from the list. This will reveal the details of your video and the edits. Also, click the "**Setting"** drop-down menu and select the Relaxed, Aggressive, or Custom option for the video effect.

![premiere pro output and setting<](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-output-and-setting.png)

Step6 Select the "**Matte Generation**" below Key Color. Try different levels for **Highlight**, **Shadow**, **Tolerance**, **Transparency**, **Pedestal**, and other settings to further clean the matte for a premium effect.

![premiere pro matter generation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-matter-generation.png)

Step7 In this step,choose the **"Matte Cleanup"** option to expand its settings and clean up the edges of your clip. You will see various options here, but the most important one is **"Choke."** It will shrink the object's borders and "Soften" to add fuzz.

![premiere pro matte cleanup settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/premiere-pro-matte-cleanup-settings.png)

If you see a background color spill on your video after playing with the above settings, click **"Spill Suppression"** beneath Matte Cleanup to expand its options and choose the desired settings to resolve this issue.

That's about it! You have successfully removed the video background in Premiere Pro.

Step8 In the last step, you need to save, render, and export your video with the removed background. To do this, click the **"File"** option on the Premiere Pro Media Browser, and choose **"Export"** to explore the "Media" menu.

Choose the format in the Export Settings, as it is compatible with most devices. Next, choose a valid **Preset** and **resolution**, and click "Export" to begin the rendering process. Finally, save your edited background video again, and export the video to the desired destination.

## Green Screen Is a Widely Used Effect in After Effects. Many Professional Photographers Use It to Make Creative Video Effects. This Guide Will Show You How to Use Green Screen to Videos in After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

## How to Resize FLV Video Efficiently[Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone &

FLV Videos are Flash Video files with a .flv file extension. FLV video files were once one of the most popular video file types and the standard video format used for embedding videos on the internet and streaming.

In this article, you’ll be learning **How to Resize FLV Videos Efficiently** on all the platforms. But wait, what exactly does the resizing mean?

**Steps to resize FLV videos with Filmora Video Editor:**

1. **Launch Filmora and open a new project**

Run the Wondershare Filmora application on Windows or Mac after installing it. Then you should automatically be inside a new project. If not, you can manually open a new project by going to **_File_** on the top left corner and then clicking on ‘**_New Project_**’.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-1.jpg)

1. **Import the FLV video and add it to timeline**

Click on ‘**_Import Media Files_**’ and import the flv video into project media from your computer’s file explorer. Then add the video to the timeline by dragging it inside the timeline.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-2.jpg)

1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\. Otherwise, you can do various editings on the video like cropping, muting, trimming, animating, etc. before resizing the video. Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

1. **Adjust the file size of the video through export settings**

After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the **_Export_** button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-6.jpg)

Filmora Video Editor really makes the task of editing and resizing FLV videos easier, simpler, and faster. Since you now know the steps, it’s time you try it and resize your own FLV videos with this best FLV Editor for Windows and Mac.

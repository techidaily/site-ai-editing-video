## Hot FAQs on Converting Videos for WhatsApp

### 1\. How can I send a 10-minute video on WhatsApp?

Users can directly send videos with 10-minute-length via WhatsApp if the file size is 16 MB or lower. Otherwise, you can compress the file using a **video converter for WhatsApp.** Alternatively, you can upload your file into your Cloud account and copy the link to send.

### 2\. How to convert YouTube videos to WhatsApp?

You can directly copy the YouTube-based video link below the Share button on its page, paste it into the chat, and send it. Alternatively, you can use a reliable converter tool to download YouTube videos in one of the supported video formats (e.g., MP4). Then, share them via WhatsApp chat.

### 3\. How to Send Videos on WhatsApp Without Compressing?

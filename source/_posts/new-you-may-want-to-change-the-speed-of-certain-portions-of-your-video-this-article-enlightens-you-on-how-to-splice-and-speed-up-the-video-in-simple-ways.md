There are several text-adding ways and methods by which you can make your collage look interesting. Considering a few important ones will let you create an impressive collage in no time. Check out some useful tips and tricks to use text within the photo collage.

**●** Identify if you wish to add the text as the focal point or not. If you are using the text as the first striking thing in the collage then ensure that it is eye-catchy and interesting.

**●** Keep a good balance between the text and the images so that it does not look weird.

**●** The color and the font of the text are among the most important factors to be considered. Make sure that both the text color as well as the font match and blend well with the theme and the images in the collage.

**●** Keeping the background of the text simple, less detailed, and also clutter-free is important so that the text content comes out nicely.

**●** Make sure only to add a few words or lines in your collage to make it look sophisticated. It's majorly a photo collage with a dash of the text so keep it that way only and not vice-versa.

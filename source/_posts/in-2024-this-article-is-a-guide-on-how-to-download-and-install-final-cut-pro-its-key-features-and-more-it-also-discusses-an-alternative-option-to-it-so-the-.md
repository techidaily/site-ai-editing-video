## Part 2\. Use Text Templates in Premiere Pro

While learning video editing in Premiere Pro, you will choose a suitable template, right? So, to make your title look more professional, you need to replace the text variant and adjust the color. In the Adobe Premiere pro, you can choose your preferred template as dozens of templates are available there. You can find the one and opt for which you want to select by simply dragging it to the timeline. Here's a complete process on how to edit text in adobe premiere pro using text templates:

* Now, opt for “edit tab” from where you can opt for the text alignment and addition of the transparency. Further, you may manually tilt or rotate text here.
* Then, you have to choose the font and its size. If you have to opt for resizing a video, do so by the selection of the required font. You can then go for the adjustment of the size of the text that’s there on the “Edit tab”. The icons will be disabled in the case if there is no support for bold and/or italic options. Furthermore, if you wish to underline any object, you can easily add it to a font.
* At this point, opt for the addition of color/effects to the text. You will see options like fill and stroke. (An outline around the shape of a text), shadow, and many more.

## Discover How to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures for Free. Elevate Your Content with HD Quality Green Screen Frames

The digital landscape is bustling with content creators showcasing their talent, brands promoting their products, and educators teaching various skills. Amidst all this digital hustle, have you ever stopped to wonder how some creators seamlessly integrate themselves into dreamy, otherworldly, or even fantastical backgrounds?

How does one moment show them standing in their living room, and the next, they’re strolling through the sandy beaches of the Maldives or floating in space?

The answer to these mesmerizing effects is the magic of green screens.

* [Part2: Free Websites to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures](#part2)

## Part1:What is Green Screen Footages and Application Scenarios

The concept of the green screen, or the green screen mobile frame, isn't new. Hollywood has used it for decades to transport actors to distant planets, into the heart of battles, or atop treacherous mountain peaks. The principle is simple: film your subject against a vibrant green backdrop, then use software to replace that green with any video or image you choose.

So, why green?

The color green is distinct, easily distinguishable, and not typically worn as a primary color in clothing. This makes it simpler for software to isolate and replace without accidentally morphing the subject into the new background. The result is a clean, nearly flawless integration of the subject with whatever setting or scene you can imagine.

But it’s not just about transporting subjects to new locations. A green screen mobile frame or video green screen frame allows for interactive presentations, imaginative storytelling, and even sophisticated effects, like adding dynamic weather elements or supernatural phenomena. It can turn a static, dull scene into something vibrant, interactive, and engaging.

**Application Scenarios:**

1. **Entertainment & Films:** This is the most obvious. From massive Hollywood productions to amateur short films, green screens create different worlds, enhance scenes with visual effects, or simply transport characters to diverse locations.
2. **Education:** Educators use green screens for virtual field trips or to create interactive lessons, making learning more dynamic and interesting.
3. **Gaming & Streaming:** Have you ever seen a game streamer with just their figure visible over the gameplay? That's a green screen at work.
4. **Digital Marketing:** Brands use it to produce compelling ads without the hefty cost of actual locations or sets.
5. **Social Media Content:** TikTokers, YouTubers, and Instagram influencers employ green screens to add a layer of creativity and uniqueness to their content, standing out in the ever-crowded space.

The magic of green screens is everywhere, bridging the gap between imagination and reality. With the rise of accessible technology and software, what was once restricted to big-budget studios is now at the fingertips of anyone with a camera, a green cloth, and a vision. And with the platforms we're about to delve into, sourcing green screen mobile frame HD content has never been easier. So, ready to jump into this world?

## Part 1: Potential Reasons to Share YouTube Videos in Zoom

Everyone’s favorite app, YouTube, provides a lot of useful services for its users. The online streaming platform contains millions of videos on almost every topic from around the world, ranging from educational content to recipes and music videos.

The Zoom streaming service has also gained tremendous popularity in recent years, particularly owing to the raging pandemic that swept the world off its feet. It is quite a convenient software program that lets you organize online meetings with up to a hundred members or more in the premium version.

Certain moments may arise when you want to **share a YouTube video on Zoom**. Luckily, the Zoom platform offers various methods by which users can do that easily. But why would you want to share a video from YouTube on Zoom in the first place? Let’s shine some light on that.

Let’s assume you are taking an online class via Zoom. You find a YouTube video that you believe can help explain the topic to your students. During the lecture on Zoom, just like viewing a video on a projector or a screen, you can share your chosen YouTube video with the rest of the class easily.

Now let’s say you are organizing a business meeting via Zoom. You have a YouTube video showing a compilation of different forms of marketing strategies that you wish to share with your team. With just a few simple clicks, you can easily share the YouTube video with everyone present in the meeting.

You and your friends are having a group video chat on Zoom. While laughing at something your friend said, you suddenly remember seeing a reaction video meme on YouTube that would exactly fit the situation. You quickly search it up and share it with your friends, who then applaud you for your choice.

These are just some of the scenarios where you might have to share YouTube videos on Zoom. A whole set of different reasons may arise, which can cause you to share a YouTube video with your Zoom attendees. If such an instance arises, you need to learn how to do that quickly and efficiently.

## Part 2: How to Share YouTube Videos in Zoom

While each of us might have different reasons for sharing YouTube videos on Zoom, the process to do so is identical on all versions of the Zoom application. Looking for a guide on how to **share YouTube videos on Zoom** easily?

Below, you can find two different methods using which you can seamlessly share a YouTube video of your choice on Zoom. The methods are accompanied by a step-by-step guide and relevant images, so you don't get lost along the way.

### Method 1: Sharing Video through Screen Share

The easiest and most effective method to **share a YouTube video on Zoom** is using Zoom’s screen sharing option. It is designed in such a way that users can share whatever is being shown on their screens with their audiences, such as PowerPoint presentations, documents, YouTube videos, and more.

The following steps indicate how you can share your video via the screen share option in the Zoom app:

**Step 1: Open Your YouTube Video**

To begin with, launch the browser on your computer and go to YouTube’s website. You can now search for the video you want to share with your Zoom attendees. If you have your video saved, simply access your playlists to open the video. Click on the video and ensure that the volume is turned up, but don’t hit Play yet.

**Step 2: Share Screen on Zoom**

Back in your Zoom meeting's main screen, check the bottom line for options. A green "Share Screens" option will be available in the middle. When you click on it, Zoom will open a window showing all the tabs open on your device. Click the screen with the YouTube video and check the little box next to "Share Sound" at the bottom left corner of the window. Now hit "Share."

![tap on share screen feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/share-youtube-video-on-zoom-2.jpg)

**Step 3: Play Video**

### Method 2: Using Links to Share YouTube Video

**Step 1: Copy Video Link**

Open YouTube on your device and navigate to the video you wish to share in Zoom. Tap the “Share” button below the video’s title and hit “Copy” to save the link on your clipboard.

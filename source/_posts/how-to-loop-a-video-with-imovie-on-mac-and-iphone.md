### The Bottom Line

Have you learned how to fade out music in Movavi? If so, then you would also find out that the Movavi fade audio alternative, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), provides a selection of audio editing options in addition to video editing features. The Movavi editor is capable of spicing up your videos and audios, however; Filmora's workflow is a little more established and well-defined than Movavi's, which is what propels it to the top of the audio editing field. As a result, Filmora would be the better option if you intend to work as a video editor for a long time.

Whatever your reasons, this article will show you how to do live streaming and recording at the same time using three different methods.

## Way 1\. Use OBS To Stream And Record Video At The Same Time

### Steps

Step4 Finally, click **"Apply"** to save your settings. Now when you start your stream, the recording will also begin simultaneously.

## Way 2\. Use Twitch To Save Your Streams

Twitch is the most popular and best live streaming platform that allows gamers to broadcast their gameplay to a live audience and also gives them the ability to save their past broadcasts, or **"streams."**

This feature can be useful to save your live stream for later viewing or share your stream with someone who missed it.

### Features

Twitch offers a variety of features that make it a unique and powerful game streaming platform. Some of the most notable ones are:

* **Live streaming:** Twitch allows gamers to share their gameplay in real-time with other gamers around the world. This live aspect of the platform makes it unique and engaging.
* **Social interaction:** Twitch offers a variety of features that allow gamers to connect with each other, including chat rooms, forums, and user-generated content.

**You can save your stream on Twitch in two ways:**

* Use the **"Highlights"** feature, which allows you to save specific moments from your live stream.
* Download your stream's entire **VOD** (video on demand) after it has ended.

## Steps to Denoise in Final Cut Pro – Reduce Video and Audio Noise

Whenever it comes to the term denoise, we usually get kind of “lost in translation” – does it mean to remove or reduce just the background noise in terms of audio, or does it intend noise effect on the actual scene which we see visually? Anyway, using video editors, denoising is possible in both ways. And why should we denoise at all? – to find out, we will touch upon both issues, and learn how to do those two things in Final Cut Pro.

**How to remove background noise in Final Cut Pro?**

It doesn’t really matter if you are preparing a video for youtube, a podcast, or any other content with audio in it – for your listeners to be engaged, you need a clear audio, but sometimes that is not the case. You might even find unnecessary background noise after recording the video or audio, and it can be really annoying – that kind of recording gives your audio tracks an unprofessional touch, which can lead to disengaged listeners, the viewers who just don’t want to listen to it anymore. But it’s always possible to turn the tables – and for it, using video editors might really give us a hand. So, Final Cut Pro, which is developed only for Macs (so, you will not be able to use this software on the PC), can solve this problem for you.

So, if you are using Final Cut Pro 10.6, it’s possible to achieve your goal without using any plug-ins. In such a case, there are special effects to use. First of all, let us say that you have an audio file which you want to be corrected because it has some echo, hum, background noise; so you import that one into the programme, namely, timeline.

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-1.jpg)

You will need to first use Equalatization, which is under the Audio Enhancements.

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-2.jpg)

You will need to check the square that opens the equalizer and shows graphics for it. The high frequencies are on the right, and the low ones you will find on the left. Lower the highs and raise the points a little on the left side.

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-3.jpg)

Next step would be to level out the lows and highs of the voice using a Compressor. You will find this effect in Installed Effects, which you need to drag and drop on the audio, and it will raise the whispers and lower the shouts in the audio.

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-4.jpg)

Some background noise will still be there, so you then can find Channel EQ effect you will find in the effects. You need to drag it on the clip, then click on the equalize button in the inspector, and this time, reduce the lower levels on the left, while you also lower the highs on the right.

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-5.jpg)

Lastly, you will need to use the Noise Gate effect. This will cut out all of the sounds between words, so when someone in the audio is not speaking, there will be no background noise at all.

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-6.jpg)

In case this kind of cutting noise out doesn’t sound natural, you can look into Noise Gate Parameters and concentrate on two of them – reduction and release. If you drag the latter right, the noise will raise, and reduction will also raise noise a little, in order to reduce the clipping.

**How to denoise a video in Final Cut Pro?**

But what is noise in terms of videos? It means that the video is not clear, but instead, the clip has grains on it, which is not so pleasant to see (unless you use noise/grain effect with some purpose!). the noise usually appear when the shot was taken in an environment with not enough white, or, in other cases, when the video was taken with small-sensory equipment, for example, smartphone or action camera.

And Final Cut Pro is one of the video editors where you can remove or reduce the noise and make your footage look clearer than it would have been originally, and it will guarantee that people who are interested and watch your clip will have a better experience. So, let’s learn step by step how to denoise the video in our beloved Final Cut Pro, which added this feature only starting from Final Cut Pro 10.4.4 – it means that before, the task was only done by using some expensive plug-ins, but starting from this version of the program, the software has video noise reduction effect itself.

So, choose the video which has some noise and grain and you wish to edit. Bring it in the program, and click on it in the timeline, in order to select it. The video should appear in the viewer, and you will be able to see the noise right away or whenever you zoom in a little. Then, you will need to find the Effects – you can just use the shortcut and click on Command and 5, or find the panel in the top-right corner of the timeline. Whenever Effects appear, you will need to select the Basic category, and then double-click the icon to apply the noise reduction filter, and close the window. It might take a while to analyze the clip for noise.

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-7.jpg)

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-8.jpg)

In the inspector, you will find the controls for noise reduction, which only include the Amount and Sharpness.

![denoise-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-final-cut-9.jpg)

You might as well boost the amount to high, then you can take a look at the image to evaluate the result. One way to do the last step is to uncheck the box next to the Noise Reduction as well, which will disable the filter until you check the box again.

You can also change the Sharpness to Medium, which will compensate for the soft look the effect produces.

And, there is also a noise reduction effect dedicated to 360 viewers, which is called 360 Noise Reduction. As you can see, the effect removes a lot of noise and makes the grainy video look clearer and more enjoyable, besides, if you move around the sphere in the viewer, the effect seems quite seamless!

According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The option to speed up or slow down individual clips is one of the most important capabilities of Premiere Pro.

![Control playback speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/1-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it's well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program's many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.

You can't overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.

Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience.

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?

If this issue arises in your program, you'll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.

The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.

It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## How to Add Video Transitions in Videos

Editing a video is equally important as recording a video. A raw video footage is never appealing to the eyes because of sudden cuts, unnecessary parts, and lack of eye-catching effects. That is why video editing is crucial for turning an unappealing raw video into an attention-grabbing video.

A video transition effect is the most commonly used graphical effect in video editing.

Therefore, a video transition effect sits in between two shots and connects them together smoothly so that it does not look odd to the eyes. Video editing with transitions is a common practice for short videos on social media, presentation videos, and even movies.

A video transition effect is effective when you are jumping from two moods and emotions in the video. It is equally useful while jumping between storylines, points of view, and timelines. Besides, you can spice up your narrative and make your video eye-catching as well as eye-soothing. There are different types of video transition effects such as fade in and out, zoom in and out, dissolve, wipe and pan.

## Part 2\. How to add transitions in video?

To add transitions to your video, you will need a video editor.

## Part 3\. Video transitions tips and tricks

If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.

**Consistency** – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.

**Experiment** – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.

**Out of the Box** – The reason you recommended [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.

**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.

**Meaningful** – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood. Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.

## The Bottom Line

Video transition effects are essential in almost all types of videos. They enhance the video content and make the transition between scenes smoother. You should choose your video editor wisely so that you can avail different types of video transition effects.

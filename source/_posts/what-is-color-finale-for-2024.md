##### Step2 Add The Video Clips to the Timeline

Once in the timeline, your video is ready to go into editing mode. But before we insert the template of our intro, we need another step as shown!

##### Step3 Trim The Video Clips

As it's the intro, we need to trim the video clips, so they are concise. You may have recorded longer video clips, but we need clips that are no longer than **5 seconds**.

To trim the video clips, follow the steps mentioned:

* Move the **playhead** on the video clip to where you want to trim.
* Click on the **scissors** icon on the Playhead.

This will split your video clip into two parts. Now, you can delete whatever part you like and keep the other one.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** To measure the time of the video clip, keep an eye on the **Time map** above the Playhead.

![wondershare filmora trimming the video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-youtube-intro-6.png)

When you have trimmed your video clips to your liking, it's time to add the Title text that will act as an intro to your video!

##### Step4 Add The Title Text

You will need a title template to add text to your video clips. For this,perform the following actions:

* First, click on the **Title** icon above the import window.
* On the left column explore and browse the animated title as you want.
* **Double-click** on a title template to preview it.
* Once you have selected the Title template, drag it above the start of your timeline above the video clip and it'll all set.

After you have added the title, the next step is to add your intro text.

##### Step5 Type The Intro Text

For specifications of the video and ongoing content, you have to tell the audience before starting. For this, you need to type the intro text as shown:

* **Double-click** on the title template.
* Type in the text you want in the text box.

![wondershare filmora adding text in the title box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-youtube-intro-7.png)

Play the video clip from the beginning to confirm your changes. Now that we have created a graphic text, it's time to add the audio.

##### Step6 Add Music

To give more pleasing look and effect, you must add the music into it. Follow the steps below to proceed it further:

* First select the **Audio** icon above the import window. This will direct you to Filmora's Audio library.
* Browse the library and pick whatever royalty-free music you want.
* After you've chosen the music for your video, drag it to the timeline below the video clip.
* Cut the music to match the length of the intro and it's all done.

![wondershare filmora adding music to the intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-youtube-intro-8.png)

## How to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix

Netflix is the most popular streaming service in the world. It offers loads of movies and series that you can watch on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Over the years, Netflix has become a one-stop destination for watching movies and TV shows in different languages.

While the user base of Netflix is quite diverse, the platform offers subtitles in limited languages for most movies and series. Suppose you want to view a Korean Drama on Netflix with French subtitles. However, you found that French subtitles are unavailable for that Korean Drama. In such a case, you might wonder if adding custom subtitles to Netflix is possible.

Well, you can add subtitles to Netflix, and there are two different methods to do the same. This guide will help you learn both methods available for adding custom subtitles to Netflix. So, let's get started!

## Method 1\. Upload Your Custom Subtitle to Netflix

Before proceeding with this method, you must remember that it only works if you are a Netflix Premium user. Now, let's discuss how to add subtitles to Netflix with this method.

### Key Steps to Follow

Below are the steps for adding custom subtitles to Netflix.

Step 1 First of all, you need to install and add [Language Learning with Netflix & YouTube™](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/bekopgepchoeepdmokgkpkfhegkeohbl?hl=en-US) extension to your web browser (Chrome or Edge).

Step 2 Make sure the extension is activated.

Step 3 Download the .srt file that contains the subtitles in your preferred language for a particular movie or TV show.

Step 4 Open Netflix on a Chrome or Edge browser and sign into your account.

Step 5 Play the movie or TV show for which you have downloaded the subtitles.

Step 6 Within the Netflix player, you will see a settings icon left to the **Subtitles** icon. Click on it.

Step 7 Among the various setting options, you need to choose the screen and find the one with the label "Lower Subtitles (Mother Language)". You need to click on its field and select the "Upload Subtitle" option.

Step 8 You will see a pop-up window at the top of the screen where you need to click the "Choose File" button.

Step 9 You then need to navigate to the directory on your computer where you have downloaded the subtitles file, select it, and click the "Open" button.

Step 10 Click the "Okay" button to upload the subtitles to Netflix.

Step 11 Close the settings window and play the video. You can view the uploaded subtitles at the bottom of the player.

## Method 2\. Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Extensions

If you're not a Netflix Premium user, you can still add subtitles to Netflix with the help of certain browser extensions. We'll list them down and discuss the steps for using one of them; the basic steps for using all such extensions are pretty much the same.

### 1\. Substital

### 2\. Super Netflix

**Web browsers:** [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-netflix/iakpdiefpdniabbekcbofaanjcpjkloe)

Super Netflix is yet another reliable extension to add subtitles to Netflix. Apart from adding custom subtitles, this extension allows you to change the video playback speed. Like Substital, the Super Netflix extension on Chrome Web Store also has 100K+ users.

**Key Features**

* It can help you avoid spoilers by blurring images and episode descriptions.
* You can use the extension to skip intros automatically.

Unlike the other two extensions mentioned above, Netflix SubStyler only allows you to change the styling of subtitles on Netflix. However, the thing that makes this extension worthy of your attention is that it comes loaded with several customization options.

**Key Features**

* You can choose a custom text color for the subtitles either with the help of an in-built color picker or by entering the RGB value of the color.
* The extension lets you add text outlines and change the size of the text.
* You can even add a text background and change its color and opacity.

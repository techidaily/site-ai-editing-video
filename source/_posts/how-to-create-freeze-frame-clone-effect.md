## Dollar-Store DIY Hacks to Use for Filmmaking on a Budget

Filmmaking is usually an expensive hobby, but slowly over time, it's become more affordable. Regular gear like cameras and lights are slightly cheaper, but there are plenty of ways to DIY regular items to use as film gear.

Making DIY film gear may not give you the same look as professional gear, but it could be a fun project and give you similar looks on a budget. In this article, let's look at some dollar-store DIY hacks that you can use for filmmaking on a budget.

![diy film gear](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-1.png)

## Tip 1\. Add foreground elements to improve the frame of videos

Let's start with something we can do to enhance your framing. Sometimes we want to direct our audience's attention to a specific part of the frame. In this case, it's the talent of placing an object in the shot's foreground that can help us do that. While also making a more attractive frame. At the dollar store, try using something like these fake plants.

![fake plants](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-2.png)

You can place it in front of your lens. Then focus on the talent behind it, giving a blurry foreground that perfectly frames the talent. Here's how the shot looks with and without foreground elements.

![framing the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Remember, you can also use a **different angle** than simply approaching the object from the front. You can try and use different perspectives until you find the shot or footage you are looking for.

## Tip 2\. Adjust lights with poster boards

The shot below looks dark and boring because the background has no light. Here's the shot with and without the lights.

![shot with or without lights](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-4.png)

A practical light is a light that shows up on screen rather than lighting talent from off-screen. For example, some dollar stores have small LED accent lights for around three dollars.

Others even have lights with adhesive backings that allow you to place them all over the room—creating great lighting accents with small eye-catching pockets of light.

![lights with adhesive backings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-5.png)

On film sets, crews use a bounce to reflect light from one light source in another direction. At the dollar store, we can find something like this poster board to get a similar effect.

![use bounce to reflect light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-6.png)

By reflecting the light onto the bounce, we get softer, more spread-out light when it's reflected. Then you will get the result in a nicer look. Using poster boards, you can do multiple things with light.

* Use white to bounce light.
* Use black as a flag to shape or block light.

![use white to bounce light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-7.png)

* You can also use green for a small green screen when filming a product video

You might have seen how big production companies create those alienated landscapes, such as in the movie Avatar and many more.

The concept is recording your object in front of a green screen behind it. Then, it's much easier to add a separately filmed background to the final footage with a video editor like Filmora.

![green screen to create the fake background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-8.gif)

## Tip 3\. Smooth audio with felt pads or socks

Do you ever have audio pop while you are recording? It can get annoying. So, to fix the issues, we are now teaching you three practical ways.

### 1\. Felt pads

Felt pads with adhesive backs can be stuck onto noisy props like a coffee mug. This way, we won't hear the mug hitting the table when we're recording sound.

![felt pads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-9.png)

### 2\. Socks as pop filters

Professionals use what they call a pop filter because a pop filter can reduce the loud pops from their mouths. But what is pop? Pops usually occur when people say words that start with the letter P or B.

Then what is a pop filter? You might have seen in some YouTube videos, especially live streamers, where they use a microphone with a plate on its head; that's called a pop filter. You can purchase pricey gear like a pop filter, or we can get a pack of cheap socks at the dollar store and place them over the mic.

It will make your voiceover slightly quieter, but it should also get rid of the popping. So keep adding socks until you hear no more pops in your voiceover.

Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.

### 4\. [Skeleton breaking screen](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Skeleton-breaking-screen.html)

### 7\. [A Family Wearing Handmade Halloween Mask At Home](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/a-family-wearing-handmade-halloween-mask-at-home-43000093665.html)

Given everyone will be in their costumes, you can also consider distributing self-made masks for everyone. You can take ideas from any of the numerous videos about Halloween mask design ideas.

Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it. The vibe from simple Halloween buckets stacked together is on the next level; if you do not believe me, look at Angie Bellemare’s Halloween Bucket ideas and creativity:

![halloween bucket stacked filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-8.jpg)

### 9\. [Carving Of Pumpkin For Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/carving-of-pumpkin-for-halloween-43000011941?af=&sualg=)

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video. It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:

![halloween bucket carving filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-9.jpg)

### 10\. [Dough Halloween Cookies Bakery Products](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dough-halloween-cookies-bakery-products-43000090890.html)

If Halloween is more about spending time with friends and family, a bunch of laughter, fun, and creating memories, then it cannot get better than focusing on the sweet stuff, like the dough used to cook the Halloween cookies. When you imagine the scenario of dough mixing for the Halloween countdown timer video, it does not sound like much! But they are cool-looking and set the perfect backdrop for a countdown timer video:

![dough halloween cookies bakery product filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-10.jpg)

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. [Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/girl-blonde-portrait-halloween-43000089959.html)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. [An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/an-outdoor-table-with-halloween-theme-settings-43000100754.html)

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video? There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.

## Part 1: Top 10 Halloween-Themed Footage for Halloween Countdown Clock Video

Here we provide footage exclusively for horizontal videos, so that you can use them for your videos for YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, etc. If you just want some clips for TikTok, Ins story, or anything else, go ahead Halloween footage for vertical videos.

### 1\. [Fog Stones Halloween Dead](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/fog-stones-halloween-dead-43000147017.html)

Spooky graveyard with scary tombstones is another good way to go about it when you are looking for vacation countdown clock videos. The mixture of the turbulent and serene environment is enough to set the Halloween mood and even scare some folks.

Remember the scene from the movie “The Fog” and its famous dialogues: When the fog rolls in the terror begin! If you do not, take a look at a scene and judge for yourself if scary enough or not.

![fog stones filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-1.jpg)

### 2\. [Scary Sadako ghost](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Scary-Sadako-ghost.html)

What’s better than the Sadako ghost 7-day video call threat on Halloween? Well, nothing! So, why not create a prank video for your friends and family, especially those afraid of Sadako? Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.

But you do not have to go through all that costume and scenery setup. Instead, you can use the video footage on any premium video and apply Sadako ghost via Green Screen.

![sadako ghost filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-2.jpg)

### 3\. [Transferring Halloween Cupcakes From The Tray To The Table Moments](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/transferring-halloween-cupcakes-from-the-tray-to-the-table-43000103154.html)

Halloween is adored for its trick-or-treat, but what about the party? What will you serve? Cupcakes sound like a good idea. But how will you entice your guest with your Halloween cupcakes? Well, you can include the cupcakes in the invitation video. While you can find many Halloween creative and savory cupcake recipes on YouTube, you can use stock footage to have them in the video.

![cupcakes halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-3.jpg)

### 4\. [Skeleton breaking screen](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Skeleton-breaking-screen.html)

The broken screen is the classic prank suitable for any event and day. But simply using apps or replacing the wallpaper on your friend's or spouse's mobile doesn’t cut in this age and day. With new technology coming in, you have to get creative. Plus, it’s for Halloween, meaning dead skulls are a must.

![skeleton breaking screen filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-4.jpg)

### 5\. [Dark Monster Halloween Horror](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dark-monster-halloween-horror-43000084917.html)

Halloween house horror is another great backdrop for scaring your friends after a vacation countdown clock. You will find tons of videos on Halloween Horror houses on the internet. Look at how Jackie from Super Enthused (YouTube channel) gets scared while touring the 10 Halloween horror houses at the theme park. That was really scary, and this Halloween countdown effect can also help you do the same to your viewers.

![horror house filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-5.jpg)

### 6\. [Face Portrait Halloween Clown](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/face-portrait-halloween-clown-43000083759.html)

Scary clowns against a kid’s window have been the long norm of scaring the small ones. No doubt, such pranks can scare anyone, not just kids. If you do not believe me, look at the reaction video from Infinite featuring scaring clowns’ pranks.

But how about dropping such a scary face bomb in a vacation countdown clock video? You can easily get your hands on creepy clowns’ portraits for videos via premium stock libraries like Filmora’s Filmstock.

![scary clown portrait filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-6.jpg)

### 7\. [A Family Wearing Handmade Halloween Mask At Home](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/a-family-wearing-handmade-halloween-mask-at-home-43000093665.html)

Another not-so-fancy, subtle, and understated appeal for the Halloween vacation countdown clock video is a family together with Halloween masks. Given everyone will be in their costumes, you can also consider distributing self-made masks for everyone. You can take ideas from any of the numerous videos about Halloween mask design ideas.

![face mask family filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-7.jpg)

### 8\. [Halloween Buckets Stacked Together](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/halloween-buckets-stacked-together-43000180211.html)

What’s the simplest and most fitting footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock? Well, it is the scary pumpkins. Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it. The vibe from simple Halloween buckets stacked together is on the next level; if you do not believe me, look at Angie Bellemare’s Halloween Bucket ideas and creativity:

![halloween bucket stacked filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-8.jpg)

### 9\. [Carving Of Pumpkin For Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/carving-of-pumpkin-for-halloween-43000011941?af=&sualg=)

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video. It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:

![halloween bucket carving filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-9.jpg)

### 10\. [Dough Halloween Cookies Bakery Products](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dough-halloween-cookies-bakery-products-43000090890.html)

If Halloween is more about spending time with friends and family, a bunch of laughter, fun, and creating memories, then it cannot get better than focusing on the sweet stuff, like the dough used to cook the Halloween cookies. When you imagine the scenario of dough mixing for the Halloween countdown timer video, it does not sound like much! But they are cool-looking and set the perfect backdrop for a countdown timer video:

You can use such clips individually or mix them with other stock video footage mentioned here to create a perfect Halloween vacation countdown clock video clip.

![dough halloween cookies bakery product filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-10.jpg)

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. [Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/girl-blonde-portrait-halloween-43000089959.html)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. [An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/an-outdoor-table-with-halloween-theme-settings-43000100754.html)

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

### 4\. [A Kid In A Mummy Costume Holding A Halloween Bucket](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/a-kid-in-a-mummy-costume-holding-a-halloween-bucket-43000093674.html)

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video? There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.

![mummy costume filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-14.jpg)

### 5\. [Stop Motion Of Halloween Candy](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/stop-motion-of-halloween-candy-43000095152.html)

Hosting a Halloween party for kids and in search of the perfect vertical footage for a Halloween vacation countdown clock video? It cannot get better than simply featuring a bunch of candy to lure the kids toward the countdown clock. When you look at this video and imagine using a clock for the countdown clock.

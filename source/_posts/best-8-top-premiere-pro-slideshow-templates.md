## Related FAQs About End Screen Maker

**1.** **How Do You Make an End Screen?**

Making an end screen is different depending on the tool that you use to create the end screen as well as the number of elements that you choose to add to it. But usually, you would start with a template and begin adding elements to the project one by one.

**2.What is the Best Free Outro Maker?**

The best tool to create an end screen for YouTube videos is Filmora simply because it makes the process very easy while allowing you to customize your creation as much as you need. But even though it has a free trial version, most of the features you need to create a unique end screen are not available on the free plan.

A good free solution would be Canva because it has numerous free resources that can create a decent end screen. Although we must point out that many of the best templates and elements on Canva are also not available for free.

**3.How Long can a YouTube End Screen Be?**

A typical end screen is often 5-20 seconds long. You don’t need any more than 20 seconds because it is only used as a way to promote additional content or add a call to action. So when creating an End screen, ensure that all elements are clear enough as your audience will have only 20 seconds to see it.

Even though it is just 20 seconds long, the end screen of your YouTube video can be the most important aspect of the entire video. It is a great way to further engage with your audience and with the tools on

this list, you can now create the best end screen for your video.

## AI Features of Wondershare Filmora - Silence Detection in Videos

Sometimes awkward silent moments can make a video look cringe and boring. Silence in videos can often be a major drawback, making the content dull and unengaging. However, fear not because there are ways to eliminate them and keep your viewers hooked. One effective solution is to utilize certain features that help in removing silence from videos.

**Silence detection** is a feature that lets you detect silence and awkward pauses in your content. It can detect those instances where there is no audio or any significant sound present. By utilizing this feature, you can easily identify and remove these silent parts from your videos. Wondershare Filmora is a tool that offers this AI-powered feature to **remove silence from videos**.

## Part 1: How Can Silencing in Videos Damage It?

Silence can negatively affect videos, making them less engaging and captivating. Many **video silence removers** are available, but first, learn how silence affects video content. Let's explore some of how silence can damage the quality of video content:

### 1\. Loss of Interest

When viewers encounter long silent moments in a video, they lose interest. Silence fails to hold their attention and leaves them craving for something more stimulating. As a result, they may lose interest in the content and look for other videos. This is somewhat discouraging for a content creator. That's why short and meaningful content is what the audience demand.

### 2\. Lack of Emotional Connection

Sound and audio play an essential role in creating an emotional connection with the audience. Silence, on the other hand, fails to start any emotional response. Without appropriate sound effects or dialogue, videos can feel empty and emotionless. The absence of audio elements also fails to establish a connection with the viewer.

### 3\. Breaks the Flow

Silent moments in videos can disrupt the natural flow and rhythm of the content. Viewers expect a seamless progression from one scene to another. However, sudden silences in a video may create frustration for some individuals. It may also lead to a disjointed viewing experience for the viewer. Meanwhile, the audience sometimes couldn't understand the intended message.

### 4\. Awkwardness and Uncomfortable Silence

Silence can create awkward moments in videos, especially when it's unexpected or prolonged. These silent gaps can make viewers feel uncomfortable. The viewer becomes unsure of what to expect or how to interpret the situation. Moreover, awkward silences can detract from the overall viewing experience. It also leaves a negative impression and makes the content less enjoyable.

### 5\. Reduced Engagement and Sharing

Videos that contain excessive silence are less likely to be shared or discussed among viewers. Silent moments fail to generate excitement or spark conversations. In contrast, videos with dynamic audio elements are more likely to capture attention. If your video has long pauses or awkward silent moments, it may not get the expected response.

You want to start your video production after launching the Photos app. To do so, go to the top right corner of your screen and select New Video Project, which will take you to the editor mode.

The second part of this procedure is known by several titles in different versions of Windows 10's Photos app, such as creating a video with music, creating a film with text, and a new video project.

Launching the editor mode directly from the photo if you're using photos in your video project is also possible. In that case, consider the following:

* Open your file in the Photos app
* Select Edit & Create
* Select Create a movie with text from the drop-down menu.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-7.jpg)

You can name the project by typing it in the name tab in the top left corner of your screen. Then, by clicking the pencil icon next to your project's name, you can alter your title at any moment.

The video editor in the Photos app won't allow you to upload files until you've given your project a title. When you try to add a file, a pop-up choice will display, and you may write in the project's name and then click OK or Create a Video to continue.

### Step 3: Import Files

To add files to your video project, go to the Project Library portion of your screen and click the + icon that you see in the top left corner.

If you have all of the files you wish to merge into one video in one folder, you can select them all and add them to your project using the 'This PC' option. Alternatively, you can add the files one by one.

The tool will automatically combine all of your files into a single video. Then, you can alter the video order in the Storyboard and edit them.

Go to your Project Library and drag all of the files you added to the video editor into the Storyboard section to get started on your project.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-8.jpg)

### Step 4: Trim Video Clips

You can also trim your clip in the Photos app if necessary. Here's how to do it:

* On your Storyboard, select the Trim icon.
* Using the handlebar, shorten or prolong the duration of your clip as desired.
* Select "Done" from the drop-down menu.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-9.jpg)

### Step 5: Remove/Add Sound

You can now select numerous music options from the Windows library or upload your own.

Select the Background Music option in the top-right corner of the screen. Then, mute or adjust the volume of your video.

Or select Add an audio file from the Custom Audio menu in the top-right corner of your screen, select the file you want to Import, click Open, make any necessary changes to the audio file, and select Done.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-10.jpg)

### Step 6: Add Text

You can add text to your video project using the Windows video editor, but there aren't many font styles to choose from. You'll also have to add and optimize your text for each clip separately, which isn't the most time-efficient approach.

To add text to your clips, follow these steps:

* Choose Text
* Select the small box icon on the clip you want to add text to
* In the empty box, type the text you wish to add.
* Select the font style you want to use.
* Choose where your text should show in the video.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-11.jpg)

### Step 7: Export/Save Merged File

You can save your video project to your computer after being happy with it. To do so, follow these steps:

* Click the Export, Share, or Finish movie option in the top right corner of your screen.
* Select the video resolution in which you want your video to be saved.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-1.jpg)

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents' voices and customize them.

Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.

Features

* The software allows you to Customize your brand's tone.
* It creates responsive IVR agents.
* Possible to do Advertisement text generation with AI with one click.
* Allows Instant language translation.

Cons

* The user interface could be enhanced.
* \- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.
* From text to video For the first time, turn plain words into a professional-looking video.

Pricing

Synthesia offers two pricing options.

$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)

Enterprise – Individualized Pricing

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.
* There isn't a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.

Because the application can be operated with hotkeys, you can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent exploring the UI. Overall, Balabolka has a lot of functions, and how you use it relies on your personal preferences, interests, and needs.

Dark One, Exterminator, and Blane, for example, are plainly meant to resemble Darth Vader from Star Wars, Daleks from Doctor Who, and Bane from The Dark Knight Rises, respectively.

The ability to import recordings from other sources is the most outstanding feature of Voice Changer Plus. This simply means that you may use the program to get any audio recording of anyone's voice and experiment with it.

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.
* From text to video For the first time, turn plain words into a professional-looking video.

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

Pricing

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.

Final Thoughts

As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-1.jpg)

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents' voices and customize them.

Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.

Features

* The software allows you to Customize your brand's tone.
* It creates responsive IVR agents.
* Possible to do Advertisement text generation with AI with one click.
* Allows Instant language translation.

Cons

* The user interface could be enhanced.
* \- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.

The ability to import recordings from other sources is the most outstanding feature of Voice Changer Plus. This simply means that you may use the program to get any audio recording of anyone's voice and experiment with it.

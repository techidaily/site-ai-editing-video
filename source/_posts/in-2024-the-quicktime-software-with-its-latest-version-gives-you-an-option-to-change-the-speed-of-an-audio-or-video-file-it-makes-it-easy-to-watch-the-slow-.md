Although there are many other video editors out there vying for attention, Wondershare has been one of the few that has managed to stay relevant in an increasingly competitive industry saturated with old and new video editors all competing for the same consumer base.

### Unique and Distinct Features of Filmora

Software is not nearly as good if it does not have the appropriate set of functionalities, and most users will not bother to use it if it does not include these features. Listed here are the most eagerly anticipated features of Filmora's latest version:

#### Motion Tracking

The Motion Tracking module enables you to identify an object or point inside a video and then have the computer track that object or point to generate a moving path.

It allows you to capture the motion of a moving object in the frame and add text, subtitles, effects, and other components to the frame that follow the moving object's motion as it moves around the screen. After you've constructed that path, you may link any other item to it and have it follow the initial object.

#### Colour Matching Feature

This team has always considered that Filmora's colour grading and correction tools were excellent, but their most recent addition to the 'Color Matching' program has garnered them even more praise.

Colour matching is crucial when trying to merge several video images obtained by two different cameras. In this semi-automated module, you may match video from multiple sources or footage acquired at different times of day with one another.

#### Keyframing Feature

Keyframing is an essential feature for users who wish to boost the appeal of their video by incorporating critical animation sequences throughout the film.

It enables you to create custom animations and have fine-grained control over the effects you apply to your projects via the use of keyframes.

Keyframing becomes critical when creating special effects, custom title cards at the beginning or middle of a film or conjuring precise paths for visuals or picture-in-picture movies to follow.

#### Audio Ducking

Audio ducking is a method used in video editing and production that allows the narrator's voice to be heard consistently and clearly over other sounds on the recording that are happening at the same time, such as background music, without being dominated.

#### Transitions and Vast Amount of Effects

Over 300 special effects, objects, overlays, transitions, and music and audio effects are available whenever and wherever you need them. The bundle includes 25 sound effects and 26 royalty-free recordings, making it a complete package.

Then there are 176 transitions, each of which may be customized to liven up your project. You may also alter and manipulate visuals and text to make your project more aesthetically appealing.

#### Hardcore Video Editing

Moving on to the heart of this application, Filmora latest version's video editing features are both excellent and user-friendly. \[pagebreak\] The editing options in Filmora are comprehensive, with the most noticeable being cutting, audio manipulation, transition creation, visual effects, and a plethora of additional features and functions.

The above editing functions are simple to carry out by selecting a specific section of the video on your timeline, double-clicking it, waiting for it to appear in the preview section, and then applying effects and transitions, adding audio, stabilizing and correcting the video using any of the editing options available to you.

#### Simplified Exporting Of Your Masterpiece

Exporting a finished project is as simple as any other activity in Filmora latest version. Indeed, the option to export your completed project is clearly presented on the main page and instantly visible to the human eye. After you've completed making changes, all you have to do is click the 'Export' button.

### How to change video playback speed in Filmora

When using fast-motion/slow-motion effects on a video, the clips are sped up or slowed down in comparison to their original speed.

If you're looking for a "close up in time," the slow-motion effect may be the best choice, while the fast-forward effect may be used to produce dramatic or amusing videos.

## How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion  & Free LUTs Resource

LumaFusion is one of the most complex iPad and iPhone video editing apps. Many of its customers adore it, and it has some incredible capabilities that you'd find incompetent editing software. They've effectively opened up the realm of LUTs to iPhone and iPad users.

LumaFusion LUTs are individual files that act as containers in LumaFusion. This container file includes standard LUT data as well as LumaFusion-specific color preset data. A LumaFusion LUT Preset file is similar to a Super LUT. LumaFusion can only employ one standard LUT at a time; however, LumaFusion LUT presets enable simultaneous Color Grading and Color Corrections.

## How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion

Colors in today's cameras are vibrant, but they may continuously be improved. Color correction corrects the color that's already there, whether it's boosting the exposure to brighten a darker photo or increasing the saturation to make the colors pop. Color correction in other NLEs can be difficult, but not in LumaFusion.

The Color Presets tab in the Color & Effects section is where you begin color correcting footage. There are various presets from which to pick. I wouldn't use these settings on my videos because they're too stylized, but they're there. You may alter any of the presets to your taste, so some of the more dramatic ones can be toned down. By picking the original setting, purists can color-fix their raw footage without using LumaFusion. Moving the sliders till the color seems perfect is all that's required from there.

Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, mid-tones, and saturation and hue are all controlled by sliders. The color sliders can be used for a more forceful approach. But proceed with caution. The sliders are delicate, and it's easy to overdo them. Play around with the sliders until you get the look you want. If you don't like it, toss it in the trashcan and start over.

Color grading and color correction are not interchangeable terms. Color correction is a technical requirement, but color grading is primarily creative. You'll have no command over the color grading process if you're working with film material where primary colors aren't even visible. Before diving into the creative LUTs, make sure you complete adequate color correcting.

Color grading, unlike color correction, adjusts the shot's color to modify the atmosphere or feel. The only way to do that in LumaFusion is to play around with the color sliders under the Color Presets tab, but that's not ideal. As previously stated, the three sliders are sensitive and limited. LumaFusion isn't designed for color grading, which is OK. Thankfully, LumaFusion allows you to use LUTs.

Always color correct your footage before utilizing any LUTS, which entails changing the White-balance, Highlights, Contrast, and Shadows. Do not apply the LUTS to your footage directly.

## How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?

Videographers, colorists, and editors use LUTs because they are efficient. Rather than starting from zero every time you work on a video editing project, you may speed up the color grading process using a LUT with predefined color profiles. It's elementary to import LUTs. Simply import the preset files into LumaFusion and add the preset to your footage like an Instagram filter.

The Import button in the Color & Effects editor is the easiest way to load LUTs.

1. Double click on any video/photo clip on the timeline to access the Clip Editors.
2. At the bottom of the Clip Editor UI, select the Color & Effects tab.
3. The import button is located directly below the effect preset library.

PremiumBeat has freely given countless LUT packs as well as other assets to any video editor or filmmaker over the years. Todd Blankenship has designed a fresh new set of FREE LUTs for Shutterstock, which is their latest addition. Todd chose distinct looks from films and pictures that inspire his daily work to create this bundle with attention and love. There are many options, and these looks will offer you a great place to start when it comes to grading your footage. They recently published an in-depth evaluation of Photon.io, a new color grading tool. Todd Blankenship, who ended up utilizing the tool to create these LUTs, wrote the initial review. The pack has been fine-tuned to replicate some clean, cinematic looks that you may use as a jumping-off point for your video.

### 5\. [Frank Glencairn free LUT](https://frankglencairn.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/everything-looks-better-on-kodachrome-k-tone-lut/)

Despite having access to the most advanced filming gear, there's something about a vintage film aesthetic that looks fantastic. Frank Glencairn has made a nice K-Tone LUT that is meant to look like vintage Kodachrome film. This film grade, which was formerly popular among photographers and filmmakers, has fallen out of favor due to the rise of digital cameras. With this free LUT, you can get the appearance of retro-looking reds, blues, and yellows.

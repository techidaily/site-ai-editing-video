This app provides excellent variety, being a free editing application. Furthermore, it offers transitions and striking effects to function with.
* Windows Live Movie Maker is free of cost for all Microsoft Windows users and is basically for clients having zero to minimum experience editing audio and videos. Moreover, it has many special effects you may use while creating videos. Also, you may frag and then place any picture or video anywhere you wish to see it.
* You can choose from several themes, enhancing your film with tools like contemporary themes, fade effects, and sepia toning choices. You have to click once, and then the users can choose and apply from the multiple effects collection.

 Cons

* Windows Movie Maker contains unlimited audio and video tracks, yet it provides just one accessible one at a time. Hence, if you wish to include some other audio or music track, you may prepare the video, thereby sending it to the ultimate file.
* It isn’t uninstallable using any remove or add control panel. Also, it is impossible to do video overlaying.
* This app requires much patience because it is prone to crashes. Moreover, you'll require enough time and effort to do video reversing. It often becomes frustrating for all advanced editors to cut clips into small parts and then add them back. Hence, Windows Movie maker isn't good for professional video editors.
* Windows Live MovieMaker can crash and freeze and is known to suffer frequent crashes. Hence, ensure saving often and avoid creating complex videos. Also, you cannot perform complex editing and can now prepare single audio and video track.

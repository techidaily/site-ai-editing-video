![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of **TTS** technology or **Text-to-Speech technology**.

As its name suggests, **TTS** or **Text-to-Speech** is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself/herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as **speech synthesis**, which means artificial human speech production.

Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.

While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.

So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the **Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software** with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:

## **1\.** **Murf.ai**

![text-to-speech-software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/text-to-speech-software-1.jpg)

**Supported system:** It is a cloud-based platform, therefore can be used online on Windows, Mac, Android, and iPhone.

**Basic Intro:** Murf.ai is an AI-based voice generator and text to speech converter that is popular for its ability to make studio-quality voiceovers in minutes. Unlike most of the text-to-speech software out there, Murf is focused on creating human-like voices with the help of AI rather than the same old robotic voices. And it’s not just a text-to-speech converter.

## This Easy Hack Using Wondershare Filmora New Masking Feature Will Be a Great Addition to Your Next Horror Video Content

Wondershare Filmora's main purpose is the empowerment of content creators. The latest updates to the program are one of the pieces of evidence.

Whether you're a horror content creator or simply living the Halloween vibe 24/7, continue reading to know how to use its latest masking feature to create a cool shadow effect for your next mind-blowing social media video.

## How to Use The Masking Effect

[Wondershare Filmora's](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) latest Masking feature allows its users to select a specific clip that they can overlay on other parts of the video or other clips.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The feature allows you to insert the mask in any shape, such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle. You can also import any shapes you like if you can't find them in the presets library. You can also adjust the mask placement, width, height, and feather effect.

Without further ado, let's see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.

### a. Preparation

You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.

Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.

Take the first main video and don't forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.

Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.

![taking different footage for the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-1.gif)

### b. Steps to add the shadow effect to your videos using Masking

Step 1: Place the main clip on the timeline and find the start of the segment that you want to use. Press M on the keyboard to set a marker.

![placing a marker on the main clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-2.jpg)

Step 2: Place the shadow clip on top of the main clip on the timeline. Trim and adjust until the shadow clip ends right at the marker of the main clip.

![adjust the length of the shadow clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-3.gif)

Step 3: Move the play head to the start of the shadow clip. Trim the main clip right on that mark so both clips have the same start by clicking the scissor icon and deleting the unused part.

![sync the main and shadow clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-4.gif)

Step 4: Double-click the shadow clip. Open**Settings > Mask Section > Rectangle** to apply the mask. Adjust the blur strength to smooth out the edge.

![place the mask of the shadow clip and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-5.jpg)

Step 5: Play the result to see if there's any part you need to block out. When you find them, repeat steps 1 to 4 but with the background clip. Try to conceal all things you need to hide using the masks. Make sure that you get the timings right.

![block unwanted objects off the final clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-6.gif)

The feature allows you to insert the mask in any shape, such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle. You can also import any shapes you like if you can't find them in the presets library. You can also adjust the mask placement, width, height, and feather effect.

Without further ado, let's see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.

### a. Preparation

You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.

Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.

Take the first main video and don't forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.

Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.

##### Step 2Slow Down Video with the Optical Flow Option

Right-click on your clip and pick "Speed Ramping" from the list. Now, choose the "Customize" option and move below to edit it. Hold the dots and adjust their location to change the video speed. You can select Montage and Jumper effects to change the speed of clips.

Now, scroll down and find "AI Frame Interpolation." Click on the downward icon and tap "Optical Flow" for slow but high-quality video.

### Effective Key Features of Filmora

Besides smooth playback, Filmora offers powerful AI features to edit videos. Let's explore some of its dynamic and innovative options.

* [**AI Copilot**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** This tool provides you with an AI assistant in case you are unfamiliar with editing basics. It can not only guide you but also navigate towards the respective features. Users can ask anything and find solutions with natural language prompts.

* [**AI Music Generator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** Are you tired of internet surfing but haven't found perfect music? Filmora offers AI-generated music that perfectly aligns with your content needs. It allows you to choose the number of music tracks, moods, and duration of the videos.

* [**AI Image**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** With Filmora, getting a copyright-free image is not a big deal. Users have to describe an image and pick one style to grab their dream image. Also, they can select an aspect ratio to start creating an image.

* [**AI Smart Masking**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** Often, the best-captured media seems useless because of its messy background. AI masking comes to rescue your projects. You can use the Chroma key or AI portrait to remove or change the backgrounds of the media.

## Conclusion

To wrap up, **Adobe Premiere Pro's slow playback** can occur for several reasons. Many solutions are discussed above to tackle such errors and avoid frustration. Meanwhile, you can use Wondershare Filmora, which is much easier. Also, it does not cause any errors while working and ensures a smooth workflow. With AI features, users can effectively perform every kind of video editing task.

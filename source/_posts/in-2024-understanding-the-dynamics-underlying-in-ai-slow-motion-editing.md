Amidst this transition, the development of games with the motion blur effect is also present. But does a gamer need a motion blur effect in their games?

Although motion blur is present in many game settings, it has not been acknowledged in the gaming community. However, there are still doubts about this effect. In this article, we will discuss **motion blur gaming** in detail. We will also decide whether gamers require a motion blur effect in their games. Read this article to know if motion blur is beneficial or problematic for gamers.

## Part 1: What is Motion Blur?

The motion blur effect has been a part of many movies and videos. It has been used as a source to display objects moving at high speed. This effect is bridged in situations where the objects moving in speed are directed in a single direction. However, this effect is not adjusting the object in a frame but creates an apparent blur.

If you tend to pause that video or movie during the motion blur effect, you will find the picture blurred in a specific direction. This is because the camera records the blur as the motion information, providing a realistic effect. Many filmmakers and videographers utilize this feature and tend to develop a sense of fast-moving objects. This advancement has turned out to be quite successful.

![what is motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-games-2.jpg)

With the help of the information recorded through motion blur, the high-speed objects moving within the frame are coherent within the 24 frames, which is the standard frame rate per second. However, motion blur has also been tested at 29.97 and 30fps, which does show diversity in its functionality.

### An Overview of Stop-Motion Animation Effect

If you tend to display the cohesive effect of the object within the image, you will have to cut short the particular clip. It should be done in 24 frames to achieve a frame-by-frame display of the object with changing direction. This removes the dynamic blur within the video. However, it displays another effect generally referred to as stop-motion animation.

Talking about this principle, stop-motion animation is quite common in old animated films. The movement was displayed by taking snapshots of every frame with the object displaced within each frame. Combining these snapshots, a complete stop-motion effect was created, making footage. The animation is captured one frame at a time, with a sequenced display. However, no blurring is present within the animation, making both discussed effects different.

## Part 2: What is Motion Blur in Games? Why Do Games Have It?

Once you understand the concept of motion blur, it is time to figure out **what motion blur is in games.** This particular effect has not only been used in films but is now taking place within games for a realistic effect. Unfortunately, the use of stop-motion animation within the games is not effective. Although it has a standard frame rate of 24fps, the screen always lags.

Since the recorded action is manually adjusted within the frames, the motion is inaccurate, indicating the need for a motion blur effect in games. Talking about motion blur in games, this particular effect was not observed for a long time. The use of motion blur increases the quality of the game, but it also enhances the size of the game, which requires better equipment.

The games did not include the effect for quite a long time. Every frame was clear since the stop-motion animation runs under this principle. The clarity in frames, if operated at 24fps, the standard rate for stop-motion animation, will show screen lags. This is why the games were operated at least 30fps to be almost smooth.

When these screens were to display high-speed movement, the game had 30fps displayed lag on screen. Rapid changes in cameras led to the need for games to include **motion blur gaming.** This was based on smoothening the fast-moving effect covered in 30fps or less. Motion blur has improved the overall video output effects of the game. Due to motion blur, you can observe better transitions with a smooth flow at a lower fps rate.

![what is motion blur in games](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-games-4.jpg)

## Part 3: Should Motion Blur in Game Be On or Off?

The question that arises, in this case, is whether you should keep **the motion blur on or off.** To answer this question, you will have to observe why gamers dislike motion blur in games. As this effect is most prominent in conditions where the screen's frame rate is 30fps or lesser, it becomes redundant if the screen's frame rate is less than it.

Although you have heard that motion blur makes a screen smooth, this goes the other way in such situations. The display gets sticky for screens with lower frame rates, making the user dizzy. A good gaming engine provides the function of automatically adjusting the motion blur effect against the screen's frame rate. However, if the user is not playing such quality games, they will face this issue.

It is better to turn off the motion blur effect for games without this adjustment or conditions where the output video remains sticky. For smoother results, the motion blur effect is preferred. It clarifies that the problem generally ranges from player to player. This clearly explains that motion blur is not the culprit in this situation.

![condition of using motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-games-5.jpg)

## Part 4: Is Motion Blur Good for FPS? Does it Increase FPS?

Motion blur, as explained above, is pleasing if it makes your results smoother. Generally, this is the reason why **motion blur gaming** was considered. Thus, motion blur is good for FPS; however, it does not increase the frame rates of your computer’s screen. The explanation above shows that motion blur has nothing to do with increasing the frame rates. It blurs the object's trail by sustaining the video within the same frame rates.

The brain corrects the pictures the eye observes since it is being observed in natural circumstances. The use of motion blur improves the experience. Along with that, the results are always considered realistic under dynamic blur. In conclusion, motion blur is considered much more effective in video games.

## Are You Aware that You Can Create Your Own Lower Thirds for Video? Read This Article for a Tutorial on How to Customize One

As a video creator, there are times when you need to use Lower Thirds. Although many lower-third presets are available, making unique and personalized ones can ensure your video stands out.

So, to empower your inner video creator, this article will show you how to make your own Lower Thirds in Filmora.

## Part 1: What is Lower Third

A Lower Third is a mix of motion graphic design and texts that are placed in the lower area of the screen. It provides additional information, such as a person's name or other relevant information, without distracting the audience from the main content.

Lower Thirds can be used in various settings, such as news broadcasts or interviews, to help provide viewers with additional context.

### (1) A simple line and texts

![a simple line and texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-1.gif)

##### Step1 Create a simple line

Go to the **Media library > Sample Media folder > choose a color sample**. For this tutorial, we will select the white color. Then, drag and drop this sample color onto the upper video track.

![create a simple line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-2.jpg)

Double-click the white sample clip to open the settings and scale it to 30%. Then, reposition the white bar to your desired place.

![double-click the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-3.gif)

##### Step2 Mask the white sample

Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the **Effect window > Utility > Image Mask**. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.

![mask the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-4.gif)

After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.

![double-click the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-5.jpg)

##### Step3 Add a text for your lower thirds

Go to **Titles > Plain Text > Basic 6** and drop it onto the second video track above the white line clip. Don't worry about the exact position yet. We can adjust it later.

![add a text for your lower thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-6.jpg)

Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.

![double-click on the text clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click **Advanced > Animation > Up Down 1** animation. Adjust the animation length by dragging the two brackets on the timeline on the right side. Click Ok.

![add animation to the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-8.jpg)

##### Step5 Add keyframes to the white line clip when entering

Double-click on the white line clip on the timeline to show the animation keyframe setting window. Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when entering](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-9.gif)

Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.

After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.

![move the play head to the left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-10.gif)

These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.

##### Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting

Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it's close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-11.gif)

You don't need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.

Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0\. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.

![move the texts out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-12.gif)

Playback the video and see how it looks.

### (2) A name card with a solid background

![a name card with a solid background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-13.gif)

Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here's how to do it:

##### Step1 Make the lower third background

Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.

![make the lower third background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-14.jpg)

Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.

![change the scale to 30%](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-15.gif)

##### Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background

Drag and drop the Image Mask onto the white sample clip on the timeline.

![create an image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-16.gif)

Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.

![double-click on the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-17.jpg)

##### Step3 Add some text

Once the background card is in place, go to Titles > Plain Text > ‘Basic 6' and drop it onto the third video track.

![go to titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-18.jpg)

Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.

![type in the texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-19.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click Advanced > Animation > Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.

![click advanced](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg)

Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.

![double-click on the background clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-21.jpg)

Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0\. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.

![move the play head again](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-22.gif)

To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.

![add two more keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif)

If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0\. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.

Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”

![add a subscribe button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-24.jpg)

By using a Storyboard you can represent your story visually. You can make commercials, animated movies etc. Here are some questions from which you will get to know everything you need to know:

### 01What is an Online Storyboard?

A web based storyboard works in all your preferred devices and smart phones. The tool does not require a download or installation; however the tool requires a sign up for working on the platform.

### 02What are the components of a storyboard?

**●** A detailed description of communication

**●** Informatory Strategies to teach the learners

**●** Proper information of audio with file names

**●** Feedback for the assessment

### 03Why do you need a Storyboard?

A Storyboard is a process of pre- production. It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.

**●** **Is this concept is going to work? -** A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.

**●** **Arranging Shots -** A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.

**●** **Saving Money -** Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.

**●** **Recognizing the mistakes -** On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.

**●** **Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -** When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.

### 04How to Label Storyboards?

If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.

For example: Panel\_7\_New\_New\_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name\_ Script#\_Scene\_Frame\_01.JPG

### 05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?

Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them "OTS 1" and "OTS 2" with the corresponding dialogues.

If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.

For example: Panel\_7\_New\_New\_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name\_ Script#\_Scene\_Frame\_01.JPG

### 05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?

Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them "OTS 1" and "OTS 2" with the corresponding dialogues.

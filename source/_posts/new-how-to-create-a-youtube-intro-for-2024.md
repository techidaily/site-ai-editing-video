## How To Create A YouTube Intro

Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It's a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.

However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.

## 1\. Keep your intro brief

The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.

Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don't have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Stay in the theme

While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won't be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.

Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you'll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. Make the first 7 seconds count

Although branding is important, it won't guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don't provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.

Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.

Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn't yours or if it's obvious that you're not interested in the subjects you raise.

## 4\. Make a plan

The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don't divide them up into manageable portions, you'll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.

One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.

It's important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don't necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.

## 5\. Include a Call-To-Action

Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won't get as a content creator if you don't ask, and this also applies to YouTube.

After you've written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.

Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you'll come out as uncertain of your goal.

## 6\. Keep it simple

It's simple to assume that more is better when creating a YouTube channel. However, if you're just starting out, the opposite is typically true.

Make a thorough inventory of everything you could include before putting together your YouTube intro. After you've written down everything you can think of, pick down the one or two most crucial elements.

You'll save a lot of time by making your YouTube intro simpler. Additionally, it will make your channel feel more cohesive.

## 7\. Create a stunning intro

For the majority of producers, creating a successful YouTube channel takes years of trial and error. A perfectionist attitude will hold you back in the beginning, especially when it comes to your introduction.

Make a YouTube opening that's decent enough to get you started rather than aiming to create something ideal. You can adjust as needed as your talents advance and your understanding of the path you want to go in deepens.

## How to Film Better in Public - 2024 Guide

Filming in public and different locations can add a new dimension to any video. The possibilities are limitless, from the hustle and bustle of a busy city street to the tranquil beauty of a remote beach.

Suppose you're a new vlogger and want to capture the perfect scene in public. Then this blog is for you. It will explain various tips and tricks to help you create the best videos, regardless of location. So let's start and learn more about how to film better in public!

## Part 1\. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?

While recording in public, you want to avoid setting and holding unnecessary camera gear. That's why you should keep your gear as low-key as possible. The essential shooting gears that you are going to need are as follows:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

### A Good Camera

A good camera is essential to record a video in public because it will provide quality footage. It will also allow you to capture more detail and create more engaging videos. But if you use a phone instead, make sure it is the latest iPhone or other with high pixels camera.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### A Tripod

A tripod is essential when recording video in public to ensure that your shots are stable and steady. Without a tripod, your camera can shake and create a distorted, blurry image that can ruin a shot. So having a secure tripod will help you capture professional-looking footage.

![a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-2.jpg)

### A Microphone

A microphone is essential for recording a video in public because it captures the sound in the environment, allowing the video to be recorded with better-quality audio. Without a microphone, the video would be recorded with distorted sound and would likely be challenging to understand.

![a vlogging microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-3.jpg)

Apart from the gear mentioned above, you can also bring an ND filter, extra batteries, and SD cards. Because If the battery runs out or the SD card becomes full, the video recording could be lost. The spare batteries and SD cards help to ensure that the video can be captured uninterrupted. Let's see what we need further.

## Part 2\. What Do You Need to Accomplish With Your Video?

While recording a video in a busy location, you need to accomplish three things with your video to record it better. Which are as follows:

### 1\. Clean Shots

When recording in a busy location, it is essential to try and capture clean shots. It can be done by using a wide-angle lens to get the full shot or zooming in to focus on a particular element.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Clean Audio

Getting a clean and clear sound when recording audio in a busy location is essential. A good quality microphone, an audio recorder, or external noise reduction can help minimize background noise and capture the desired audio.

### 3\. Decent Lighting

In a busy location, decent lighting is as important as the other two factors. Look for natural light sources that can provide good light, even illumination. If these are unavailable, consider using portable lighting equipment or lamps to create a more flattering environment.

Now that we know what we need let's see how to make a video.

## Part 3\. How to Get the Best Shot While Filming Outdoor?

Whether you are a vlogger, a YouTuber, or a student filmmaker, shooting a video in a busy area is always a challenge. You must be able to plan and execute your production in a way that minimizes disruption and produces quality footage. By following these instructions, we hope you can make a difference in a shot you record:

##### Step1 Scout the Location

Before recording, visit the location in advance to plan your shots. Take note of potential distractions or noise sources and plan your angles accordingly.

![scouting the location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-4.png)

##### Step2 Choose the correct shooting time

The best time to record a video in a busy location is when the area is less crowded, such as early in the morning or late at night. Avoiding peak times and holidays is also a good idea.

##### Step3 Choose the right angle

Once you get to the location, you must find the right angle.

**Select Background**

Try to find a background that will best capture the atmosphere of the area and minimize any background noise.

**Set the frame**

If your frame is too broad, you will face potential distractions that could interfere with your video, such as people walking in and out of the frame.

![setting the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-6.png)

**Set your position**

Instead of getting closer to your talent, get further away and zoom in this way, you leave space for other people in the location, and you can still get your shot!

![zoom in the talent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-7.png)

Try to get your shot and then get out quickly so you don't bother other people trying to get their photos.

## Part 4\. Best Way to Record Audio While Filming Outdoor

Audio is essential to any video production, and recording audio while filming outdoor scenes can be challenging.

Outdoor environments come with more variables to consider, such as wind, traffic noise, and other background noise, that can make capturing clear audio more difficult. Even if you use a high-quality mic, you still have chances of interruption.

If you get any such variable in the video you recorded, you can re-record the audio with the help of **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Let's see how you can do it:

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 First, select the clip you want to re-record and then drag it onto the timeline.

Step2 Right-click on the video you dragged and then click on the **Detach Audio**. After doing that, mute the lousy audio from the audio timeline.

![mute the bad audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-8.png)

Step3 Place the playhead at the clip's start, click **Record** just above the import media section, and then click **Record Voiceover.**

It includes your testimonial videos and video/photo materials. You can import your media files from the following sources:

* Medial Files
* Medial Folder

![import your media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/import-media-to-filmora.jpg)

To save time, it is best to prepare ahead of time all your videos materials before start editing your testimonial video. Save it in just one folder including your script guide, photos, and videos

## Select Your Preferred Project Aspect Ratio

Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of your video, which determines how it will look on different screens. There are several commonly used aspect ratios such as:

* Widescreen (16:9) – Recommended for Youtube and Facebook
* Instagram (1:1) – Recommended for Instagram and Facebook
* Portrait (9:16) – Recommended for Tiktok, Stories and Reels
* Standard (4:3) – Recommended for Facebook, LinkedInn and other

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![select your project aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/filmora-project-aspect-ratio.jpg)

Being aware of the right ratio for each social media platform will help you to advertise correctly. It also affects how you edit your video. For example, if you choose a different aspect ratio than what was originally recorded by Filmora's camera tools, then some of your content may be cut off or stretched out in undesirable ways when viewed on certain devices (e.g., smartphones).

## Split Testimonial Video into Small Clips

![split testimonial video into small clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/split-testimonial-video-filmora.jpg)

When you're ready, drag your video testimonials to the Show Track then begin to use the “split” button to cut out parts of the video.

To split a video into smaller sections, start by cutting it down to the appropriate length by moving the playhead to the beginning position of the part you want to cut, clicking the Split icon (the scissors icon) on the toolbar, or clicking the Split button on the playhead.

From there, repeat this procedure until you've completed the whole narrative. You'll be left with numerous cut segments that you may either delete or rearrange. To remove a clip from your movie, choose Delete from the toolbar or right-click and select delete.

## Add Catchy Headlines and Text (Optional)

If desired, add catchy headlines/texts like "How to Eliminate Chronic Pain Forever”. You can do this by clicking Text button from toolbar located across top portion of screen (beside Transitions button).

![add catchy headlines and text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Adding a phrase or a short sentence is called “headline”. It would be nice to add one of them at your video, so that viewers can get an idea about what it's about before watching it in full. The text can be customized by using different font styles like bold, italic, underline etc., as well as its size and color.

## Input Subtitle

Subtitles are used to translate the spoken word into text. If you have a video that is in a language other than English, subtitles can be added so that viewers who do not speak the language can still understand what is being said. Subtitles are also useful if you want to add subtitles for educational purposes, such as teaching students how to pronounce certain words and phrases.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Apply Transitions to Your Testimonial Video

You can add fade-in transitions to clips, as well as fade-out transitions.

To add a fade-in transition: Click on the first clip and select "Effects." Then, click "Transition." Choose a transition from the category of “Fades” and then apply it to the first clip by clicking on its thumbnail image.

To add a fade-out transition: Click on the second clip and select “Effects.” Then, click “Transition.” Choose a transition from the category of “Fades” and then apply it to the second clip by clicking on its thumbnail image.

## Add Background Music to Testimonial Video

You may choose from a wide range of music in the audio library. It's available both online and offline.

You can also easily add background music from your computer by going to the "Media" menu and then selecting the import option. Make sure to use a non-copyright music so that you don't run into any copyright problems when you post your video. There are several no copyright tracks on Youtube; simply search for no copyright background music or get it from other sites that provide a free-royalty background music.

![add background music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-music-test-video.jpg)

## Add a Logo/Watermark

To add a logo or watermark to your video, follow these steps:

* Import your Business Logo to the Media Folder.
* Then drag it into the Show Track area.
* Resize it to the ideal dimensions, then position it in the correct location in your video. It's preferable to place it at the top or button section of the video.

You may also add your company's logo at the end of the video as a fade-out transition.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![add business logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

By adding a logo or watermark to your video, you can make it harder for people to illegally distribute and share your video without permission. It helps also to promote your brand or business. When viewers see your logo or watermark throughout the video, they will be more likely to remember who made the video and where they can find more information about your company or products.

## Insert Thumbnail

A video thumbnail is an image that represents your video to viewers. It should be eye-catching, but not so much that it's distracting. The right video thumbnail can help you increase views and engagement on your content.

Place the thumbnail at the beginning of the video, and make sure it's catchy! Your viewers won't have time to look at it in detail, but they will glance at it in passing. Make sure to include relevant text and images that can hook your audience and keep them watching!

![insert thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/insert-subnail-filmora.jpg)

After completing the editing process, you can export your testimonial video in a variety of formats. To do this, click on the "Export" button in the upper right-hand corner of Wondershare Filmora.

Recommended Export Quality

* Resolution: 720 or 1080
* Frame rate 30 fps

Select your preferred file format and destination for storage.

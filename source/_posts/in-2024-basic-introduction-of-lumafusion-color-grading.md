## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Windows**

### **1\.** **VSDC**

VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.

Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.

Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:

Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the "Cutting and Splitting" option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-7.jpg)

On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect's duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.

Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-8.jpg)

Step 4: Save changes and export video.

Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC's resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

### **2\.** **Adobe Premiere Pro:**

Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It's also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.

We found the software's UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:

It's a strong software with a lot of features.

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

It also installs a separate Color Finale application, which is necessary for the program to function properly within the framework of macOS. This application is only used to check for and apply updates to Color Finale 2, therefore the user will not ordinarily need to access it. The Color Finale 2 effect can be applied to any video clip, compound clip, title, generator, or adjustment layer (title effect) on the timeline by dragging and dropping the Color Finale 2 or Color Finale 2 Pro\*\* effect from the effects panel in Final Cut Pro.

The interface of Color Finale 2 is split into two sections: a control panel that can be found in the Final Cut Pro inspector and a layer editing panel that can be moved around and resized. These panels make use of a design language for the interface that is similar to that of Final Cut Pro. Both have contextual pulldown pickers and contextual menus, in addition to return arrows that are located next to the majority of the parameters in order to reset their values to the default (identified by three vertical dots).

TikTok slideshows are a guaranteed media of fun and entertainment among family and friends. Used mostly as a source of personal recreation, these are a storehouse of creativity and enjoyment. Such video presentations are short enough to last for a mere set of seconds to minutes, and consequently the play speed hardly gets noticed. However, there may be a few instances that put forward the concern of **how to speed up TikTok slideshows**.

Discussing along the line, let us look through solutions of modifying the play duration of TikTok slideshows in the following section:

**User’s Guide to Adjust the Play Duration of a TikTok Slideshow**

In the application’s main interface, open a preferred slideshow presentation that you wish to adjust the time duration of.

As you finish setting the play duration, navigate to and click on the ‘Save’ button at the top right corner of the app screen to confirm and apply the changes to the TikTok slideshow.

## Part 2 How Do You Watch 3x Speed on Tiktok?

Creating and watching TikTok slideshows is a mix and match of craft and fun. As already stated, such slideshows are small enough to escape the time frame; however, you may often require a speed modification of the same. When the talk is of speed adjustment, the beneficiary side generally lies in decreasing the slideshow run time.

Moving ahead with our discussion, let us look through the process of watching a TikTok slideshow in 3x speed while sorting out the issue of **how to speed up photo slideshow on TikTok** in the upcoming section of this article:

## Part 3 Why You Should Speed Up Pictures on Tiktok?

TikTok pictures are a delight to watch and share among friends and family on social media.

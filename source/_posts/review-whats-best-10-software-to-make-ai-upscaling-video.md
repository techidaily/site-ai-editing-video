## Part 2\. Tips to Create Video Titles

Whether you've been video marketing for years or are just starting out, coming up with catchy video titles might be the most difficult aspect of the process. The title of a video has a significant role in whether or not viewers choose to click the play button, making it more than simply a minor feature. Poor titles make it difficult to attract views and expand your following, regardless of how fantastic your videos are. Here are the best scrutinized tips for creating best ranking titles for your videos:

**1\. Optimize the title using keywords for improved SEO**

It might be difficult to come up with a title that is original, concise, and descriptive. However, a strong video title stays something original. Keywords are crucial for more than simply your website. They are important for video titles, too. If you want people to see your videos when they search for certain phrases, those keywords should be in the title because Google and YouTube can't watch videos and grasp the content (yet).

**2\. Perfectly Match the Content**

A excellent video title explains to viewers what to anticipate from the video. It's unambiguous, straightforward, and sincere. Additionally, if you are familiar with your target demographic, you will be able to generate a lot more hits to your videos. Using a vague or confusing title is problematic as people are busy and need a reason to watch your movie. Similar to false content, misleading headlines deceive viewers and damage your reputation.

**3\. Attempt to pique interest**

Keep in mind that compelling video titles are an art form that appeals to viewers' emotions rather than being a precise SEO science. Try answering the questions on your own to get a catchy video title. People are more inclined to watch a video if you make reference to a secret or exceptional knowledge that you will disclose in it. Keep in mind that your goal is not to deceive viewers into viewing your video.

**4\. Increase the Click Through Rate**

The finest titles are those that best expose the vulnerabilities of the reader. Consider it a little preview for your video. If you are creating a how-to or instructive video that answers a question or gives information, you may want to consider include the question in the title. It also makes it simple to think up video concept.

**5\. Attempt to utilize cue (triggering) words**

Your title and description should both include your target keyword. You'll probably start to generate some ideas for a real video title after you begin your keyword research. To determine how persuasive these concepts are, use a trigger analyzer. You'll need to do study in order to accomplish this. As for the knowledge gap, consider how your target audience would respond.

## How to Make Random Letter Reveal Intro?

The introductions in the video can create a major feel for the rest of the video in the viewers' minds. So, most film and video makers focus on developing different styles of appealing and visually vibrant intro title formats for their projects.

Currently, one of the unique types of title format that is popular today among Youtubers and filmmakers is the style of random letters appearing on screen until the main title forms.

Double-click on the title on the timeline, which will open the text editing window. Under the Text's Preset tab, you will find the parameters for changing the main fault.

![change the value here to 20](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-2.jpg)

## 3\. Split the title

On the editing timeline, tap on the Track 1 clip and click on the Snapshot icon at the far right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will automatically save in the media library section.

Then, take hold of the playhead on the timeline at the 3rd frame mark. Then, tap on the Scissor icon on the play head, which will split the clip into two portions. Click on the part following the 3rd frame mark and delete it.

![split the clip into two portions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-3.jpg)

## 4\. Copy the clipped section multiple times

Then, double-click on the amount still available on the timeline to open the title editor section again. Make changes to the title you added here, only keeping the first letter.

Click on this clipped section on the timeline and copy it. Next, keep copying this clip multiple times continuously until the length of the collection on Track 1 to the 5-second mark.

Following that, zoom in on the timeline for a better view of these clipped parts. Choose the last clip that you copied and drag it to expand its time duration to the 6:15 mark.

![zoom in on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-4.jpg)

## 5\. Change the character of each clip

![change the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-5.jpg)

Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet.

However, keep the last elongated clip the same character as you originally put it.

## 6\. Export the first letter clip

After exporting the first file that will ultimately become the first letter of your random letter reveal intro title, you have to make the second letter-related clip.

For this, tap on the last clip on the timeline and double-click on it. Change the text in this clip to the second letter of your title. After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.

![tap on the text field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-6.jpg)

Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.

Now that you know how to edit the first and second letters in sequence, repeat this process for all of the letters of your title to create a full clip for all of the intro title letters. When you are done, please select these clips and press the Delete button to remove them from the timeline.

![select all of these clips and press delete](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-7.jpg)

Next, double-click on the first letter clip on the Track 2 section to open its editing window. Click on the Blending Mode option and choose Screen from the drop-down menu.

![click on blending mode and choose screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-10.jpg)

Then, right-click on the first letter clip in the timeline and choose the Copy Effects option from the next drop-down menu. Move the playhead to the ending position on the timeline and change the value on the relevant axis of Position until it matches its letter position on the original title.

![choose copy effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-12.jpg)

Then, hide the Track 2 clip, unhide the Track 3 and Track 4 clip, and take a snapshot of that. As you did with Track 1's screenshot, take this snapshot and place it beside Track 3 clip. Right-click on it and tap on "Paste Effects". Repeat this one by one for all the clips after unhiding them for their particular step.

## 13\. Finishing touches to Opacity

Finally, unhide all the clips and move the playhead to the 8-second mark. Click on the Scissor icon to Split them all at this position and remove the excess. Then, place the playhead at the beginning of Track 3 and double-click on it. Tap the Animation tab this time and adjust the Opacity to 0\.

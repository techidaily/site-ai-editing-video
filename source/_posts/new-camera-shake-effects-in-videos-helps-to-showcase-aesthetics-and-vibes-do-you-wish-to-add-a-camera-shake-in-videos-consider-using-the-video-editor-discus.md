## Part 3: Manually Add Subtitles to the Video on Kapwing

If you don't want to use the auto-generator and do not have a subtitle file, you can use the manual option. Kapwing allows you to add subtitles manually in its friendly user interface. After adding Kapwing captions, you can choose your preferred font and style for further enhancement.

Step 1 After accessing the website of Kapwing, select the "Subtitles" tool to proceed. Now select the "Choose a video" button to open the Kapwing editor window.

Step 2 Import your video file by tapping on the "Upload" button. Afterward, go to the "Subtitles" section and click on the "Add Subtitle" button. On the typing space, enter your subtitles. You can also choose the duration for your subtitles from the same window. To add subtitles further, you can click on the "Add Subtitles" button again.

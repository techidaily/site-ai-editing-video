## Part 1: What is Blender?

As we start our discussion, we will review [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a free and open-source software. Following this, we will continue realizing the benefits of adding motion blur through Blender:

### Introduction to Blender

For those unaware of Blender, it is an open-source, free creativity software. You can find it as the perfect designing platform for your 3D content.

![blender interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-1.jpg)

### Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect

There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:

**· Perfect For Idolizing Speed**

The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.

**· Resolves Flickering**

Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.

**· Attenuates Real-Effect**

One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.

## Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?

As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on **how to add motion blur in Blender**:

Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the "Render Properties." Look to enable "Motion Blur" from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.

![enable the motion blur option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg)

Step2 Start by setting its "Position" in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use "Center on Frame." If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the "Shutter" value or vice versa.

![adjust the shutter value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg)

Step3 Following this, define the "Background Separation" according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the "Max Blur" pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.

![set background separation and max blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg)

Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.

## 1\. Good Quality Video and Picture Coverage

Now, among several things to consider in creating product ad video, is good and quality video or picture coverage which can only be possible when there is correct lighting that can help to get a very clear video or image of those products.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Concise Videos

Another thing to put into consideration is the concise nature of your video. It must be brief and comprehensive. There should not be a lot of bulky information in the video so as not to make the customers tired and burdened.

## 3\. Correct Colour Combination

This is something that must not be neglected in making product ad videos. The colour combination must be correct and matches very well with both the products and the things written on the products. It is better to work at most with just three colours that complement one another. This will not only attract the customers but will make the customer see how professional you are and will pay anything to get the products.

## 4\. Short Videos

Videos are best with at most one minute depending on the platforms you want to advertise them on. This will make the customers not wait for a long time to understand the video and it will help the client to make the decision quickly without wasting a lot of time. It will help him make the decision quickly. Studies and statistics have it that attention span is only 8.5 seconds so you must try to make proper use of the first few seconds of your video.

## 5\. Product Prize

The goals of a product ads video are to either make the announcement of a new product on sale or to also advertise particular products to sell to make great sales. Therefore, if the product needs to be sold, then the prize should be written down boldly in such a way that the buyer can see the price. The real prize and the promo size can also be written to entice the customers more to buy.

## 6\. Text, The Font Styles, The Font Size And The Font Color

This is another important area that must not be neglected. This is another area in product ads that catches the eyes of the customers. So, the font, the font styles, and font color must go in line with the products, the text on the products and the background color of the products.

Facebook has its aspect ratio as also Instagram, TikTok, Facebook story and reels. This will make your video fit into the platform and make the video come out professionally and grandly.

Now after all has been done and the question in the heart of the audience will be, ’How can I get this product?’.The ‘call to action answers this question. So, it must be included. The call to action can be at the beginning of the video, middle of the video and end of the video but it is best placed in the middle and at end of the video.

The above and more are what should be considered and applied if you want a product ads video that can convert very well and yield massive sales.

## Conclusion

Product ads video is the order of the day and it is very important as a businessman to leverage the conversions being generated by it to make a profit and to build up engagement for your business, websites etc.

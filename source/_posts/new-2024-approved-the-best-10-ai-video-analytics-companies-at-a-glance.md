In this method, you can use the Timecode plugin instead of using the “**timeToCurrentFormat()**” expression.

While using this **after effects timer** method, you would need to add a plugin to the New Solid that will create a timer layout automatically.

Next, follow the process as in the previous steps, and a countdown timer can be added.

### Method 3\. Creating a simple Countdown in After Effects

Step1 First of all, launch the software and then create a Text Layer.

Step2 Next, open the text options using Alt + Click for PC and Option + Click for Mac at the stopwatch of Source Text.

Step3 Next, at the expression area insert the expression- Math. Floor(-time) +10\. Here in the place of 10, you can choose any number desired and this will be the starting countdown value.

Above we have learned 3 ways by which After Effects can be used for adding a countdown timer. Though these are workable methods, at times you may have issues with them and thus an alternate tool may be needed.

## Part 2: Why Countdown timer is not working in After Effects

Though a lot of people use After Effects for creating countdown times, there are situations when the software will not serve your purpose. We have collected some of the common reasons that lead to the countdown timer not working in After Effects.

**Software version out of date**

If the software version of After Effects is out of date, then several features including Countdown Timer may be missing or have issues with the same.

**Incorrect values or command**

If the value for the countdown or the statement is incorrect while using After Effects, the countdown timer will not work properly.

**The steep learning curve of the software**

After Effects comes in with a wide range of features, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the procedure to use the tool. Thus, the software has a steep learning curve which can be a problem for a lot of users and have issues while creating a countdown timer.

To place the audio at your desired location in the slide, select and drag the audio icon to where you want it. If you're going to use numerous audio per slide, it is better to put the voice icon in the same place on the slide to be easily discoverable.

Note that you must enable a microphone on your device to start recording audio.

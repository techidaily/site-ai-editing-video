## In This Guidepost, You’ll Learn What an HDRI Photo Is and How to Use the Best Free HDRI Program to Edit Photos. You’ll Also Know the Difference Between HDR and HDRI

Photography is like art itself. Photographers must carefully select the setting and use the right camera to capture images with lossless quality. However, you'll realize that some photos appear darker or brighter than in actual life.

In that case, use **free HDRI** software to change that straightway. But HDRI being a relatively new technique, beginners might struggle to edit the photos, let alone find the perfect HDRI software.

So, in this simple guidepost, we'll learn how to create an HDRI 3D picture using **HDRI for Blender**. But first, let's understand what an HDRI file is and the difference between HDRI and HDR.

## Part 1: What is HDRI?

HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) is simply an image created using multiple image overlays of the same background but with varying exposures. The exposures can range from the brightest highlights to the darkest shadows. So, in short, HDRI expands an image's dynamic range to brighten or darken it and make it look more natural.

Having said that, HDRI is a raster image created using color pixels. HDRI photos are generally significant in size, so they won't quickly lose quality like other raster photos such as PNG and JPG. Many formats can store HDRI images, although the most common are OpenEXR (.exr) and Radiance RGBE (.hdr).

 Pros

* You can easily create one using HDRI for Blender, Photoshop, EasyHDRI, etc.
* HDRI photos are compatible with many image editing programs.
* Produces crisp images with excellent detail and lighting control.

 Cons

* 32-bit HDRI files have significant sizes.
* HDRI can quickly be poorly done without prior experience.

## Part 2: What's the difference between HDR and HDRI

According to Wikipedia, HDR and HDRI are the same things. But is it true? For starters, HDRI is basically a photo with High Dynamic Range qualities. So, yes, HDR and HDRI can mean the same thing in digital image editing.

However, some photo editors argue that there is a difference between these two regarding basic workflow. First, HDR technology increases brightness to show more image details. On the other hand, HDRI performs unique optimization of content and lighting to deliver crisp images. In other words, HDRI brightens the dark shadows without necessarily overexposing the bright image areas.

Some photographers can also consider HDR as images with pixel values higher than 1 or 255\. That means that the pixels can be much higher than pure white. But technically speaking, HDR and HDRI can be used interchangeably.

## Part 3: When to use HDRI

Now that you have all the information about HDRI, let's learn about some industries where HDRI is applicable.

### 1\. HDRI for 3D visualization and 3D animation

**HDRI 3D** is commonplace these days. 3D animation creators can use programs like **HDRI Blender** to add HDR environments and make the content look detailed and more realistic in high lighting reflections. To put it simply, HDRI makes 3D scenes look lighter, less cartoonish, and more professional. This technology can also be used in interior visualizations in animations.

### 2\. HDRI for architect rendering

Creating HDRI environments is a common practice in 3D architectural designs. For example, designers can create panoramic house designs with varying light tones and interior moods. HDRI helps them give a natural 3D lighting effect on scenes and objects.

### 3\. HDRI monitors and TVs

You've probably heard of **HDRI 4K** when shopping for a smart TV or computer monitor. These TVs offer a lot more than just a wide color gamut, high brightness, and advanced contrast ratio. In addition, HDR TVs and monitors can recognize HDR signals, allowing viewers to watch the content with all studio quality. In short, viewers can see more color details in shadowy and lighter scenes, making them perfect for avid gamers.

## Part 4: How do you open an HDRI?

Because HDRIs use low dynamic range rendering, a standard display panel won't open HDR images. So, to open an HDRI file on a non-HDR display, you'll need to convert it to a different low dynamic range format using tone mapping technology. For example, you convert HDRI to JPEG or PNG and enjoy regular bitmaps while maintaining the HDRI properties. You can also open and edit HDRI using desktop programs like EasyHDR, Photoshop, and Blender.

## Part 5: How to set up an HDR environment background?

Before wrapping up this blog post, let's discuss how to use [HDRI for Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to apply HDR effects to an image's background. Blender is a 100% free program for creating jaw-dropping 3D rendering and animations on Mac and Windows computers. With Blender, you'll get an advanced modeling toolset like retopology, curves, sculpting, and more. But in this post, we'll learn how to create an HDR environment or add lighting to your image project. Let's get started!

Step1Install and run Blender and then tap the World Properties tab. Then, click the Color icon and add Environment Texture.

![free hdri for blender open world properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-1.jpg)

Step2Next, split the window into two and launch the Shader Editor tool. Then, open the Object drop-down menu at the top-left corner and choose World. You'll see the Environment Texture hooked into the background.

![free hdri for blender open shader editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-2.jpg)

Step3On the Environment Texture, tap Open Image before opening the 3.2 folder inside the Blender Foundation folder. Then, click Data files > Studiolights > Word. Now open a .exr file. For example, open the Interior.exr image.

The completion of Step 2 brings up the ‘Custom Shows' dialog box, with a blank area at the left, indicating the absence of any custom slide show as yet. To create one, navigate to and click on the ‘New' button at the right side within the dialog box.

![Creating Custom Slide Shows- ‘Custom Shows' Dialog Box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-custom-slide-show-in-powerpoint-2.JPG)

**Step 4: Define Custom Show Dialog Box**

As you tap the ‘New' button, the ‘Define Custom Shows' dialog box pops up with a display of the following fields and buttons:

**●** **Slide Show Name Box**

Use this field to assign a name to your custom slideshow. In case you don't add a name of your choice, PowerPoint will assign the name ‘Custom Show 1' to your custom presentation.

**●** **Slides in Presentation**

Below the ‘Slide Show Name' box, appears a list of slides in the chosen presentation which you can use to create the custom slide show. To add slides to the same, click on the respective slide names.

**●** **Add Button**

The ‘Add' button in the middle of the ‘Define Custom Show' dialog box is used to include selected slides from the main list explained above to the ‘Slides in Custom Show' list at the right. The ‘Add' button however, remains disabled until you make a selection from the main slides list to include within the custom slides list. Take note that you can choose to repeat the slides within the custom list.

**●** **Remove Button**

You can use this button to select and delete specific slides from the ‘Slides in Custom Show' list. The button however, remains disabled till you make a slide selection to be removed.

**●** **Slides in Custom Show**

This is a list of slides that you have selected from the main slides list to include in the custom slideshow.

**●** **Re-Order Buttons**

These are ‘Up' and ‘Down' arrows at the right side of the ‘Define Custom Show' dialog box, which are active only if the ‘Slides in Custom Show' list has more than one slide to its credit. In such a case, you can use these arrows to change the sequence of appearance of the slides within the custom presentation.

**Step 5: Back to Custom Shows Dialog Box**

When you have finished making all the required entries in the aforesaid fields, click on ‘OK' to create your custom slideshow, which is visible in the ‘Custom Shows' dialog box. You can preview the just created custom presentation by selecting the slideshow in the ‘Custom Shows' list, followed by clicking on the ‘Show' button at the bottom right of the dialog box.

The ‘Custom Shows' dialog box has an additional list of buttons, which are explained as follows:

**●** The ‘New' button, which you can click on to continue creating as many custom slideshows as you like.

**●** The ‘Edit' button, which allows you to make changes to a specific custom slideshow.

**●** The ‘Remove' button, which you can use to select and delete an existing custom presentation.

**●** The ‘Copy' button, that lets you create multiple copies of a selected slideshow. This utility comes handy when you need to work on creating similar custom presentations with an affordably small number of differential elements.

When you are satisfied with your work, navigate to and hit the ‘Close' button to finalize and save the custom presentation within your device.

**Step 2: Custom Slideshow Dropdown Menu**

**How to Set a Custom Show as the Default Slideshow?**

The custom show is now your default slideshow. In your future launches of ‘Slide Show View', only the selected custom show slides will appear to be used as a presentation.

## Part 3 How to Hide Slides in PowerPoint?

In case you have worked on a detailed slideshow presentation in the PowerPoint tool, that consists of selective contents for different audience groups, all within the main presentation, it is a wise step to hide the content slides that are not useful to particular audiences, lest your viewers might get distracted with the irrelevant content.

By far, you must have developed a significant understanding of the **custom slideshow PowerPoint** creation and presentation procedure in much detail. Moving further into our discussion, let us now work on hiding slides within a PowerPoint presentation through the following step by step guide:

**How to Hide or Unhide a Slide in PowerPoint?**

**Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Presentation**

Start with opening a desired PowerPoint Presentation in your preferred device.

**Step 2: Make Your Selection**

Visit the slide navigation pane at the left to select slide you wish to delete. Your selections will be highlighted as you tap on them. You can either delete the slides one at a time, or make multiple selections to delete them all at once.

**Step 3: Hide Slide Option**

When you have made the required selections, right click on the same, followed by choosing the ‘Hide Slide' option from the dropdown menu that appears next. The selected slides will now be hidden and you can recognize them in the ‘Presenter View' with lighter thumbnails as compared to the included slides, in the slide navigation pane.

**Step 4: Unhiding the Presentation Slides**

If you wish to unhide a previously hidden presentation slide, reach to the slide navigation pane in the left and right click on the hidden slide thumbnail. The dropdown menu in Step 3 pops up again, and you need to tap on the ‘Hide Slide' option. The selected slide will now be included in the presentation.

![Unhiding Presentation Slides- ‘Hide Slide' Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-custom-slide-show-in-powerpoint-13.JPG)

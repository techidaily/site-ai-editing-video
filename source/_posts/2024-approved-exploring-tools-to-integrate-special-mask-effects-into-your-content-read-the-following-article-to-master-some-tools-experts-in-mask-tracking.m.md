## How to Create One Click Video Reverse Effect in Filmora

All great video editors use phenomenal video effects in their videos. One of the most professional effects is the reverse video effect. This unique effect is always challenging for the makers to shoot and portray on the screen flawlessly.

At the same time, it is intriguing and always draws the audience's attention. In this article, you will learn to shoot and edit the video for reverse effects using Filmora. But first, we will learn what does video reverse effect mean. So let us get into this!

## Part 1\. What Is Video Reverse Effect?

It is a special video effect in which a motion of things starts in the backward direction. This unique effect is used to intrigue the audience.

For example, if a bullet is fired from a gun. With the reverse effect, you can rewind the footage, and the shot goes back into the gun. So today, you can easily rewind fast action scenes and get a wow reaction from the audience.

### Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films

**1- Demolition of a Wall (1896)**

Filmmakers first used this striking effect in 1896 in a 90 seconds film, "Demolition of a wall." Louis Lumiere was the one who made that video. Below is shown an image from the film.

![demolition of a wall 1896](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-1.png)

**2- Tenet (2020)**

It is a viral film by Christopher Nolan, which was a great success. He explained the concept of reverse entropy, in which you start moving back chronologically in time instead of forward. This concept is all shown through this special video reverse effect. Unfortunately, the audience had difficulty digesting this unique concept, which generated an awful response.

![tenet 2020](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-2.png)

## Part 2\. How To Shoot Video Reverse Effect?

The reverse effect is unique, so special attention should be paid while filming a video. This section will cover some of the crucial prerequisites to film a video.

### Steady Camera

It would be best to have your camera placed on a steady surface or mounted on a tripod stand to lock the focus. We will split the area and perform different tasks to make it look smooth. The audience will not get the idea that you completed the tasks separately. And it helps in the editing process as well.

![keep your camera steady](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-3.png)

### A Spacious Area

You will need a spacious area in which you will perform different tasks. Make sure your camera stands still while shooting all the frames of video. In an ample space, it becomes easier to do movements freely. It also helps prevent glitches in the final product.

### Splitting of Area into Portions

Now you have to split your area into portions. Each task is in its part of the frame, and actions in one frame should not pass over into another. You will do one activity per portion. It makes the editing process a lot easier. Finally, we get all three videos to merge and make it look like a single video.

![making three portions of the area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-4.png)

After covering the prerequisites, we will now learn the editing process of creating a video reverse effect.

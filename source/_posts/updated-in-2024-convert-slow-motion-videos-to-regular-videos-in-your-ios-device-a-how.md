#### Step 1Downloading a YouTube Video

YouTube doesn't allow users to download a YouTube video on their devices. Hence, you will need third-party support to do so. Many sites offer YouTube video download services. We are using the [y2mate.com](https://www.y2mate.com/en870), and here are the steps for it:

**1\. Copy the YouTube Video Link**

First, access the respective video that you want to download from YouTube. Locate the "Share" option at the bottom of this video and select it. Then click the "Copy" option to copy your video's link.

![copy link of youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-3.jpg)

**2\. Access the Site**

After copying the video's link, access the site using your web browser. In the "Search or paste link here" box, paste the video link and click "Start." From the download options appearing at the bottom, select a suitable option. Click on the "Download" button adjacent to your option.

#### Step 2Slow Down YouTube Video in Filmora

Once you have downloaded the video on your device, it is time to **slow down the YouTube video**. Filmora offers a plain and simple method to slow down a video. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you create video slow-mo in Filmora:

**1\. Import the YouTube Video**

Since Wondershare Filmora is a desktop tool, you must download it first. Initiate it and click the "New Project" option to reach its editing interface. Click on the "Import" option to import the video you downloaded. Afterward, bring this video to the timeline using the drag-and-drop technique.

![import video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-5.jpg)

**2\. Access Uniform Speed**

Select the video in the timeline and direct it toward the settings panel appearing on the right side. From the given tabs, go to the “Speed” tab and select “Uniform Speed.” Further, adjust the “Speed” slider or its value in the given box. This will slow down your video, and you can preview it to adjust further.

#### Step 3Smoothing Out the YouTube Slow-Mo

Upon previewing the YouTube slo-mo, you might notice some roughness in it. For creating a smooth slow-mo, use the Optical Flow option. Here are the steps to enable this option in Filmora:

**1\. Enable the Optical Flow Option**

Navigate toward the "AI Frame Interpolation" section. You can find it at the bottom of the Uniform Speed tab. Afterward, expand this section and select the "Optical Flow" option.

**2\. Render the YouTube Slow-Mo**

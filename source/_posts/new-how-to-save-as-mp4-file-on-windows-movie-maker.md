## Use Path Blur In Photoshop To Create Motion Effect

There are different kinds of blur effects that redefine the movement and intensity of an image. By applying a suitable blur effect, you can increase the visual appeal of your still photo by emphasizing a certain motion. Path blur is one of the trending motion blur effects that people use to enhance their photos instantly. Through this article, you can learn how to use **path blur in Photoshop** conveniently.

## Part 1: What is Path Blur and How Does It Work?

Path blur is a kind of motion blur that highlights a motion and speed in a certain direction. It helps to create a sense of movement by adjusting the blur intensity and central point. If you want to display a stimulating motion in an image, path blur can assist you in this regard.

Path blur works by adjusting two variables: Speed and Taper. By adjusting the speed slider, you can specify the amount of path blur. In addition to speed, you can adjust the taper value accordingly to determine the blur trail.

![what is path blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

This effect can instantly add new dimensions to your captured photo. For instance, if you have captured a photo of a racing car, you can add a path blur effect to give a sense of speed to it. You can easily find this special effect in Adobe Photoshop. By using the selection tools, you can effectively add a path blur effect to your image in the selected area. To know more about path blur in Photoshop, continue reading this article.

## Part 2: How to Use Path Blur in Photoshop?

Photoshop is undoubtedly the most commonly used tool to edit pictures with great configuration options. After uploading the image, you can quickly transform it by adding new effects, filters, and layers. You can retouch your photography efficiently through this tool by increasing the quality of pictures. Moreover, the clean user interface of Photoshop allows you to utilize the advanced functions without any interruptions.

Are you ready to use Photoshop path blur? Read this part of the article to find out two interesting ways to create a path blur effect in the images.

### Add Dynamic Effect to Your Static Images

Step1 Open Photoshop and import the desired picture. Once done, go to the "Layers" section and copy the background layer. For this, press "Ctrl + J" in Windows and "Command + J" for MacBook.

![create background layer copy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

Step2 Now proceed to the "Filter" section and locate the option "Blur Gallery". From there, choose the "Path Blur" option. Now you would be able to see an arrow on your screen. Using this arrow, you can specify the path blur motion. Drag and close the arrow where you want to show the speed. Also, set a higher value for the speed given on the right side. Once done, hit the "OK" button.

![choose the path blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

### Create a Long Exposure Picture

Step1 Navigate to the Adobe Photoshop tool and begin by uploading a picture. Afterward, go to the "Filter" tab and select "Convert for Small Filters."

![select convert for the smart filters option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-4.jpg)

Step2 Now go to the "Filter" tab again and choose the "Blur Gallery" option. From there, select the "Path Blur" option. Now adjust the displayed arrow in a particular direction to decide the starting and endpoint of the path blur. Moreover, modify the "Speed" slider according to your choice.

![proceed with path blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-5.jpg)

![delete the blue dot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-6.jpg)

Step4 Utilize the noise section to add a grainy effect in the blurred area. Once done, click on the "OK" button. Now select the masking tool to select the area in your picture. Afterward, choose the "Smart Mask" filter and then navigate to the "Fill" option given in the "Edit" section.

![select the fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-7.jpg)

Step5 In the fill menu, choose the color "Black." Now go to the "Select" section and click "Deselect." To soften the whole look, you can go to the "Properties" panel and adjust the "Feather" properties.

![adjust the feather properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-8.jpg)

Step6 Now add the first layer and choose the option "Convert for Smart Filters." Again, go to the "Filter" section, select "Blur Gallery," and uncheck the option called "Edit Blur Screen."

![tap on convert for smart filters option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-9.jpg)

Step7 Now increase the length of the arrow and press "Ctrl + Click" for Windows or "Command + Click" for Mac to reposition the path. You can also add a curve to the arrow. Enhance the speed from the right panel and uncheck the option of "Center Blur." You can increase the taper value to make the blur gradually trail off. Add a grainy filter for more enhancements.

## Find Out What Track Mattes Are in After Effects and Learn How to Find and Use It with Simple and Easy-to-Follow Instructions

Are you wondering what **Track Mattes** is? In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.

For After Effects editors, **Track Mattes** can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.

In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about **Track Mattes**. We'll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.

1. [Alpha Matte](#part4-1)
2. [Alpha Inverted Matte](#part4-2)
3. [Luma Matte](#part4-3)
4. [Luma Inverted Matte](#part4-4)
5. [Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel](#part4-5)

## Part 1\. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?

A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a "hole" in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.

You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.

Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.

Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.

## Part 2\. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte

In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.

Here're some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:

1. A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.
2. A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.

## Part 3\. Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects

Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the **Transfer Control Pane** button on the bottom-left of the timeline.

![track matte in the timeline window of the after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/track-matter-in-the-timeline-window-of-the-after-effects.png)

If you are still unable to find the Track Matte option, press the **F1 key** or do the following steps in sequence:

1. Right-click on the area above your layers and select **"Columns."**
2. Scroll down and click the **"Modes"** option to enable it.

![finding the track matte option in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/finding-the-track-matte-option-in-after-effects.png)

1. **Track Matte mode, Preserve Underlying Transparency,** and **Blending Modes** will be available now.

Under Track Matte's drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma. We'll discuss these options in detail in the next section.

## Part 4\. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects

After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:

**Alpha:** This Track Matte type uses the layer's Alpha channel to determine the layer's opacity.

**Luma:** This Track Matte type uses the top layer's brightness to mask the bottom layer.

![the four track matte options in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png)

Let's find out the functions of each option one by one:

### Alpha Matte

Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.

### Alpha Inverted Matte

The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.

### Luma Matte

Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.

### Luma Inverted Matte

Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.

### Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel

When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.

Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.

![alpha channel in track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/alpha-channel-in-track-matte.png)

On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.

* Using LUTs, you can carry experiments on your video through filter presets. The presets are available in different colors and styles, and you can adjust them.

**Drawbacks**

* There is a lack of personalization in most LUT filter presets. Hence, you cannot customize the color and styles for desired looks.
* Due to limited precision, LUTs can involve color inaccuracies in their process. This happens because LUTs follow discrete values rather than using continuous gradients.

## Part 1 **What's Video Ideas Generator and How to Use This Tool to Get More Views**

It's not enough to create a YouTube channel and post some video that does not have informative content. Sometimes, even though the video has informative content, the content might not be attractive to the viewers for various reasons, like the content might be routine and does not have more reach, likes, or shares. Along with good content, we also need new and creative ideas to get more viewers. Thus, we have some tools to provide unique and innovative ideas based on the niche you choose.

Videos Idea Generator is a tool that gives ideas for YouTube videos, and it works based on AI technology (Neural Networks). This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get more **AI video ideas**. Naturally, you might be out of ideas for your channel, or sometimes it takes more time to get an idea, or it could be a routine idea that does not sound interesting to the viewers. In such cases, **an AI video idea generator** is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics.

Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:

**●** Time-saving – as one can utilize the time in other work, such as editing the video/ adding subtitles, etc., instead of thinking of an idea.

**●** Engaging with the audience – can utilize the time in engaging with the audience by answering their questions.

**●** Promote videos – can utilize time to promote their videos on other social media platforms or collaborate with other content creators for promotions.

**●** Add animations – animations and other visual effects can be added to the videos using AI. Also, we can add video and audio summaries after each video so that the viewers can get brief detailing of the whole video.

**How to use Videos Idea Generator:**

There are different **AI video idea generator** tools, and most of them work similarly. The most common steps are:

**Step 1: Provide Topic**

Here you need to provide the topic's name on which we are planning to create the video.

**Step 2: Provide Keywords**

After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.

Based on the topic name and keywords, the tool will generate suggestions for the video ideas using the Neural Network concept of Artificial Learning.

## Part 2 **12 Great AI Video Ideas to Bring More Traffic**

Now, let us know 12 **AI video ideas** that can become viral and get more likes and views :

### 01Idea 1: Know your Interest

Before starting a YouTube channel or posting a video, know your area of interest first. Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it's easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target.

For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals/ cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video. Similarly, if you choose a gaming-related topic, do not be more general about gaming.

Be specific towards a particular section of games like mobile gaming/ desktop/ virtual to reach more audience, and it does not seem boring to the audience.

### 02Idea 2: Interview Questions

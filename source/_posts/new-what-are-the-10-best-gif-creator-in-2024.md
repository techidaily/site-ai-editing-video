Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.

While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.

Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.

## Part 2: How to tell if I can shoot HDR images on my Android devices or not?

HDR images can be captured using DSLR cameras, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the camera and the process of capturing the HDR images. A simpler alternative to this is using an Android device. The principle of capturing HDR images using an Android phone is simpler in comparison to a professional DSLR camera and also quick. Using an Android device, the imbalance in the exposure is corrected and the details of the image background, as well as the foreground, are enhanced.

* In case you cannot locate the HDR option in both the above methods then try looking for it under the Settings menu of Camera. Devices like Sony Xperia T and Xperia V have the option here.
* For the Nexus 4 device that runs on Android 4.2 OS, the option of HDR mode can be turned on by simply long-tapping the viewfinder and then tapping on the HDR icon.

![Travel Slideshow Tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/best-tips-on-how-to-design-travel-slideshow-02.jpg)

### 01Identify the audience

Before creating a slideshow, you first need to ascertain who is your target audience. The slideshow can be created for your friends, family, relatives, or YouTube or social media platform viewers. Depending on the target audience, the content and other slideshow elements will vary.

### 02Choose a travel story

Next, you need to decide upon the story of your travel slideshow. Depending on the story, you can pick up the content to be included. The story can be based on the places you visited, food, local shopping, and others. Also draft a story that has an introduction, a middle part, and an end.

### 03Sort the pictures and videos

Next comes the trickiest part of selecting the pictures and videos to be added to the slideshow. For any trip, there are hundreds of images but you cannot add them all to your slideshow. So, depending on the target audience and your travel story, pick up the most appropriate ones. Pick up the number of images and videos so that the total slideshow length is around 5-7 minutes.

### 04Edit images and add effects

Next comes the editing part. Check out the images that need editing like cropping, color correction, and others. Also, you can add some effects to make your slideshow interesting. To edit the files and add effects, there are several editing online and desktop-based tools available. You can choose the ones that meet your requirements.

### 05Add transitions

Next, choose the transitions you want to add between the images and the videos. There are slideshow-making tools where you can check out different types of transition effects and use them.

### 06Add Music

Music will set the right tone and mood for your slideshow. You can either download the relevant song from any online site or a music library or can also combine multiple audio clips to be added to the slideshow.

## Part 2 Importance of using a travel slideshow template

For some, slideshow creation can be a simple task of adding a few images and videos but for the ones who need to create something interesting, several elements go into the making of a slideshow. Moreover, when it comes to travel, the task becomes even trickier with so many things to include and grab the attention of the viewers.

So, if you are not experienced or a pro at making a slideshow but want to create something impressive, templates come to a great rescue. The templates are like ready-to-use designs where you simply need to add the required elements that in turn will create a travel slideshow.

## Easily Sync Audio With Video With Filmora

Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it's not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

That's why in this brief guide, we'll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio & video when a single camera can record both. So let's first answer this simple question.

## Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio & Video?

Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can't expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That's why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.

You might think it's an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.

![recording audio and video separately for higher quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg)

But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don't do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn't it?

Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let's first see what preparations we need. After that, we'll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let's begin our journey.

## Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording

You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It's to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.

And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.

![a clapper board used to start a film scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/film-start-clapper-board.jpg)

Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It's best to clap before you say "Action" or speak so that it's easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a **Tail Slate**!!!

After you've recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world's leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let's move forward and see how to sync audio with video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 3: How To Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora

As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let's start with the manual process first.

##### Step4Sync the audio & video files using the audio spike

Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you'll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we'll see a spike.

**_Bonus Tip:_** _If you can't find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier._

![find the sound spike on video and audio files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg)

Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.

![align the sound spikes with each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/align-the-sound-spikes-with-each-other.jpg)

Discord was a great alternative to voice chat systems such as TeamSpeak, Mumble, and Ventrilo for online gamers. Gamers **make discord accounts** for these services to play together rather than the voice communication facilities integrated into games, which are frequently of poor quality and lack functionality.

Founded in 2015, discord allowed individuals to talk while playing PC games seamlessly. Users may utilize the service to establish servers that can include many text and audio channels. A typical **discord account** server may feature chat rooms dedicated to specific themes (such as "gaming" and "anime x manga"), as well as voice channels devoted to specific games or activities. The service's high-quality, low-latency audio chat is a popular tool for Twitch broadcasters and podcasters. It has also expanded to accommodate massive video conversations to compete with Zoom.

## Part 2\. Loop Videos on Mac with iMovie

Editing a video on a Mac is always more comfortable than on an iPhone because of the larger screen. iMovie from Apple comes pre-installed on Mac as well, and hence, you can get started right away. It is completely free to use, and hence, you do not need to install any third-party video editor. Here are the steps on how to loop an iMovie video in simple steps.

Step1 Open the iMovie app from the Applications folder.

Step2 Click on Create New option and then click on the Movie option.

![create new imovie mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-new-imovie-mac.jpg)

Step3 Bring in the required video under Movie Library by dragging the file from Finder on your Mac. You can also go to File> Import Media option and select the required video. You can also select the required media file from Events or Photos under the Libraries section.

![import media into imovie mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-media-into-imovie-mac.jpg)

Step4 Drag and drop the video on your timeline. When you want to loop the video, drag and drop the video clip again on the timeline. Make sure there is no gap between the first clip and the second clip on the timeline. You can drag and drop the video clip multiple times on the timeline to increase its duration.

![drag video clip timeline imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-video-clip-timeline-imovie.jpg)

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

## Top 5 Ways To Convert Hdr To Sdr Videos

## Convert HDR 4K Video to SDR with YouTube \[Untested\]

HDR videos on Youtube show higher color dynamics and contrast ratios than an SDR video. Viewers with HDR-compatible devices will see ‘HDR’ after every video quality option in the video settings (1080p HDR).

However, the videos uploaded as HDR on youtube can be viewed on HDR unsupported devices too. This happens because youtube automatically converts all HDR videos to SDR to be viewed on non-HDR devices. Here is a brief introduction to the steps of converting HDR to SDR on Youtube:

* Record the metadata by exporting it from an HDR-supported application like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The metadata should be in a codec or container to be played by Youtube correctly.
* Grade your HDR properly as Rec. 2020 with PQ or HLG. Ensure the videos are graded correctly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are unsure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.
* rectly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are not sure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.

![color grading with wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-7.jpg)

* Once done, upload it on Youtube. If it detects HDR metadata during the upload, Youtube automatically produces an SDR conversion for non-HDR compatible devices.

![uploading the hdr video on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-8.jpg)

* Downloading the video from HDR unsupported devices will save an SDR video.

This method seems easy but has greater risks involved such as distortion of video if improper HDR grading is done.

## Get Real-time Video HDR to SDR Conversion by Video Content Providers

With gaming becoming almost a sport, online streaming has grown immensely popular. These streaming services allow you to stream in 4K HDR format. However, a significant downside of this is that many devices are still incompatible with HDR video.

We have listed multiple methods to convert your HDR video clips to SDR, but what about a live stream? We highly recommend checking out the Intel official blog post for converting your HDR videos to SDR in real-time. The blog post describes how you can convert your live stream to SDR with different methods. You can give it a read if you are interested in that.

## Hot FAQs on How to Convert HDR to SDR

### 1\. Is SDR better than HDR?

SDR is Standard Dynamic Range, while HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR is the latest technology concerning quality, clear and detailed images. HDR is perfect for videos that require high contrast, shadows, and mixed light.

HDR is definitely better than SDR because the “High” definition takes everything to the next level. However, SDR is frequently used as most devices are not compatible with HDR.

### 2\. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?

Undoubtedly, HDR provides better image quality, colors, and clarity than SDR, but why is the file size smaller then? The answer is quite simple. HDR10 files are equipped with HVAC. HVAC is a very efficient file compressor that compresses the file while keeping its quality intact. SDR files are not compressed with SDR; hence the file size is much bigger.

### 3\. Why does HDR look washed out?

An HDR video might look too bright or washed out if your device is incompatible with HDR color space. Unlike the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S22, phones have a built-in HDR recording feature. However, older versions may not be able to enjoy the clarity and colors offered by an HDR recording. Hence when an HDR video is sent to someone with an older phone, it looks as if the video is washed out.

## Final Words

While HDR might be a superior color space, SDR is frequently used for video clips so maximum people can enjoy the video despite what their devices are compatible with. You can easily convert an HDR video to SDR using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or any other methods listed above.

An important point to note is that HDR videos converted to SDR might look a little off sometimes with darker shadows and sharpness. It might be a better idea to record in SDR rather than convert it to SDR later. However, converting is still a popular way to go with an HDR video; you will also have a beautiful high-quality video and an SDR copy.

* Downloading the video from HDR unsupported devices will save an SDR video.

This method seems easy but has greater risks involved such as distortion of video if improper HDR grading is done.

## Get Real-time Video HDR to SDR Conversion by Video Content Providers

With gaming becoming almost a sport, online streaming has grown immensely popular. These streaming services allow you to stream in 4K HDR format. However, a significant downside of this is that many devices are still incompatible with HDR video.

We have listed multiple methods to convert your HDR video clips to SDR, but what about a live stream? We highly recommend checking out the Intel official blog post for converting your HDR videos to SDR in real-time. The blog post describes how you can convert your live stream to SDR with different methods. You can give it a read if you are interested in that.

## Hot FAQs on How to Convert HDR to SDR

### 1\. Is SDR better than HDR?

SDR is Standard Dynamic Range, while HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR is the latest technology concerning quality, clear and detailed images. HDR is perfect for videos that require high contrast, shadows, and mixed light.

HDR is definitely better than SDR because the “High” definition takes everything to the next level. However, SDR is frequently used as most devices are not compatible with HDR.

### 2\. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?

Undoubtedly, HDR provides better image quality, colors, and clarity than SDR, but why is the file size smaller then? The answer is quite simple. HDR10 files are equipped with HVAC. HVAC is a very efficient file compressor that compresses the file while keeping its quality intact. SDR files are not compressed with SDR; hence the file size is much bigger.

### 3\. Why does HDR look washed out?

An HDR video might look too bright or washed out if your device is incompatible with HDR color space. Unlike the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S22, phones have a built-in HDR recording feature. However, older versions may not be able to enjoy the clarity and colors offered by an HDR recording. Hence when an HDR video is sent to someone with an older phone, it looks as if the video is washed out.

## Final Words

While HDR might be a superior color space, SDR is frequently used for video clips so maximum people can enjoy the video despite what their devices are compatible with. You can easily convert an HDR video to SDR using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or any other methods listed above.

An important point to note is that HDR videos converted to SDR might look a little off sometimes with darker shadows and sharpness. It might be a better idea to record in SDR rather than convert it to SDR later. However, converting is still a popular way to go with an HDR video; you will also have a beautiful high-quality video and an SDR copy.

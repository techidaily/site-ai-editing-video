Whether you're a beginner or an experienced editor, get ready to take your music video to the next level. Let's get started.

## Which software will you need?

As we have a lot of software in the market, we must select the right software for high-quality editing.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Before you start editing your project, make sure that you have a backup. You can copy the project to an external USB or hard drive for a backup.

## Adjust the aspect ratio

The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3\. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.

You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won't shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you'll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.

![some common aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/some-common-aspect-ratios.jpg)

### How to find the width/height of the frame?

Most of the frames that are being shot on the camera are 3424 pixels wide, which is a little under 4k. If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let's suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.

**Formula:** 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)

![1st step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/1st-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you can cancel out the width from the multiplier and the denominator.

\= 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide

![2nd step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/2nd-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you are left with the equation:

\= 3424 pixels high / 2.35

After solving this equation, you will get the answer which is: 1457 pixels high. Let's adjust it on the music video as well, follow the steps given below:

### How to add the timer in the music video?

1. Click on **Effects** and search for **Timecode** in the search bar.
2. Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.
3. Extend the timer to the end of the video.
4. Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.

The interesting thing is that if light has more shape, it will precisely describe more about the scene's backstory, location, and context. Give it a try!

## Part 6\. Create Point of View Shots

After adding colors and shapes, now it's time to get some Point of View (POV) shots. Most of the time, viewers become bored by watching framing and filming coverages.

POV shots are mostly captured from a specific angle to show an object's characters. They are mostly seen in food commercials, and videographers of snacks just love to make these shots.

To make POV shots, there is nothing specific required. You just have to make a suitable position for the lens. Follow the below guidelines and capture it!

##### Step1 Cut ends of packet

To create POV shots of your favorite snack, first of all, cut down both ends of the packets.

## Part 7\. Create a Barrel Roll Shot

Barrel roll shots are the full axial shot by spinning the camera lens. Epic shots that formerly required costly gimbals and sophisticated techniques are now as simple as strolling.

## 1\. What is a Lower Third?

![What is a Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-01.jpg)

What is a Lower Third

A lower third is text and/or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.

A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.

Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.

## 2\. Why Add A Lower Third

So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”

Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.

In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.

![Why Add A Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-02.jpg)

Why Add A Lower Third

Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.

As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Tips:** A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.

## 3\. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third

As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.

[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.

Tip #1

###### Use Readable Font

Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.

Tip #2

###### Don’t Make It Too Long

There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.

Tip #3

###### Use Branding

A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.

Tip #4

###### Use Templates

Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.

Tip #5

###### Keep It Simple

Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don't use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.

Tip #6

###### Emphasize With Your Lower Third

Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.

## 4\. Step By Step To Explain Filmora

Using [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it is extremely easy to create a lower third for your video.

## 1\. What is a Lower Third?

![What is a Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-01.jpg)

What is a Lower Third

A lower third is text and/or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.

A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.

Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.

## 2\. Why Add A Lower Third

So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”

Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.

In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.

![Why Add A Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-02.jpg)

Why Add A Lower Third

Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.

As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Tips:** A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.

## 3\. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third

As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.

[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.

Tip #1

###### Use Readable Font

Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.

Tip #2

###### Don’t Make It Too Long

There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.

Tip #3

###### Use Branding

A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.

Tip #4

###### Use Templates

Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.

Tip #5

###### Keep It Simple

Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don't use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.

Tip #6

###### Emphasize With Your Lower Third

Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.

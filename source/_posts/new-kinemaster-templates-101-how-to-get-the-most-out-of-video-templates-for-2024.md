Discord is a free text and audio communication tool for gamers and other communities. The voice channel in the Discord server allows users to speak with many people. On the other hand, Discord does not have a voice recording feature. Users can use third-party solutions to capture their discord audio when speaking via voice chat. When recording someone else's discussion, be sure you have their permission. We'll show you how to record discord audio with the **Craig Discord bot** and record discord audio using Craig in this article. Craig can record discord calls also. Let's get started!

#### In this article

02 [Is Craig Discord Bot Safe?](#Part 2)

03 [How Do I Enable Craig in Discord?](#Part 3)

04 [How to Record Discord Audio Using Craig](#Part 4)

05 [Craig Bot Discord Q&A](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What is Craig Bot Discord?

Craig is a "Discord voice channel recording bot" with multi-track/multi-channel recording capabilities. In short, that means each speaker gets their audio file when Craig records your Discord voice channel.

Craig Recorder keeps track of all your recordings. You may use Craig Bot to record your calls in high-quality audio and video as a server owner.

Craig will record continuously for up to six hours. You can download a copy of the audio to examine the status of a recording until you download the file. The Craig website has a complete set of **Craig bot commands**, which you may immediately access by typing: Craig, help in a Discord channel.

## Part 2 Is Craig Discord Bot Safe?

All Craig web services, like most websites, log all users' IP addresses to identify and prevent criminal activity. Craig does not keep track of anyone who does not speak in a recorded channel, use any **Craig bot commands**, or participate in an EnnuiCastr recording.

## Part 3 How Do I Enable Craig in Discord?

All Craig web services, like most websites, log all users' IP addresses to identify and prevent criminal activity. Anyone who does not talk in a recorded channel, use any **Discord Craig** commands, or engage in a recording using the Craig web app is anonymous to Craig.

## Part 4 How to Record Discord Audio Using Craig

Craig will not record without a visible label indicating that it is getting recorded. It records your conversation with others, but it also records each user as a unique audio track, making it much easier to edit or remove specific speakers if necessary.

Follow these simple steps to use a **Discord recording bot.**

**Step 1: Invite Craig**

You must first invite Craig to your server to use him. Visit Craig's website and click the "Invite Craig to Your Discord Server" option to get started.

Now, begin the joining procedure by pressing Invite Craig to your Discord Server. This action will take you to the authorization page for the Discord server. However, before using your server, you must first grant Craig permission to join it.

When individuals hear about free online items, they frequently associate them with being of poor quality, ineffective, or unreliable. Renderforest, on the other hand, is an exception. This can be precisely what you need if you're seeking a cheap—or even free—high-quality online video editing platform. The service offers both freemium and premium solutions. The more expensive solutions provide the most flexibility.

## What is Renderforest?

A free online tool for making animated videos and slideshows is Renderforest. The web platform makes it simple, quick, and affordable for organizations and individuals to produce slideshows, explainer and promotional business movies, logo animations, and much more.

The online video creation platform Renderforest enables people and companies to produce "broadcast grade" videos for personal or professional usage. Anyone may register as a user in just a few easy steps, and using it is free.

Users can produce an infinite number of high-quality videos, export them, and then share them online or on social media.

The web platform already provides various tailor-made options for blog animations, wedding and photo slideshows, instructional films, and video invites for personal use.

Additionally, the platform offers simple-to-use alternatives for company presentations, invites to events, promotional films, kinetic typography, explainer videos, testimonials, and more.

**Renderforest's Primary Attributes include:**

* Videos of high quality

You may freely post high-quality photographs, audio, and voice-over, an incredibly fantastic feature. The ability to share their tales in a way that customers can relate to is given to business owners by this.

After you've finished editing, the video must render for a while before it's prepared for publishing. Click the edit button if you want to make some changes to the video or are unsatisfied with it. The video can be edited as many times as you like.

Users can directly post their videos on social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and Instagram, through the website.

Renderforest maintains all your projects on your dashboard for as long as you use the service, so you don't have to fear that you'll lose your work..

Regarding the free plan, you may watch and share your films on social media but not download them. You must utilize one of the paying subscriptions to download your videos. Choose the Business package if you don't want Renderforest's watermark to appear on your video. If you select monthly billing, it will cost you $149.99 per month or $49.99 per year.

## Tutorial on How to Create an Intro Using Renderforest

Professional video creators are likely aware that starting a video without a suitable introduction is equivalent to sneaking into someone's house without permission. A good intro is a doorbell to let people know you've arrived.

A strong introduction ensures that more people will view your film. Adults have an attention span of about 12 seconds, according to studies from 2000\. It is now only 8 seconds. You have 8 seconds to entice viewers to watch your video, so don't waste it. A captivating introduction will give your content a professional touch and pique your audience's interest. This task is worthwhile if you want to advertise your videos successfully.

These days, you don't necessarily need to hire a pro to make a film if you need one. The majority of the available tools are free. We'll demonstrate in this lesson how to use Renderforest to create a polished video intro. Our intro maker will let you start strong, whether for a fun birthday video or commercial use.

When you're prepared to begin producing your videos, go to Renderforest, register for an account, or sign in if you already have one.

Check out the vast selection of templates under "**Intros and logos**" in the "**Create Video**" section of the navigation menu. Here, you can select the intro you like most and begin altering it, or use our advanced search filters to locate the specific content you require.

![select intros and logos renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-intros-and-logos-renderforest.jpg)

We'll use the "**Swift Glitch Logo**" template for this tutorial, enabling you to present your logo with glitch effects. This template may produce intro and outro movies for presentations, your YouTube channel, lobby backgrounds, and other uses.

Select your preferred template and click the "**Create now**" button to start.

![swift glitch logo renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/swift-glitch-logo-renderforest.jpg)

Your logo should now be uploaded with a transparent background (PNG). You can upload it in one of three ways: using an image URL directly from your device or selecting an existing file from your "Media library." If you don't already have one, you may make one right away using our logo maker tool, which is also accessible in the editor.

![edit image for intro video renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-image-for-intro-video-renderforest.jpg)

Write your company's name, tagline, or other brief words in the text field once you've added your logo. To save the changes, don't forget to click "Save and close."

You can select the overall design of your logo and the preferred font style in the "Style" section.

![select style look for intro renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-style-look-for-intro-renderforest.jpg)

Select your preferred color scheme in the "**Color**" section now. You can choose between two color schemes made by our design team and manually selectable custom colors in this section.

Go to the "**Music**" area to select a song for your intro. You can add one or pick from our "**Music collection**." You can record a voice-over in the editor or upload one for your introduction.

Well done! Let's check out your introduction in the "**Preview**" area now. Click "**Free preview**" to check your video and ensure you like the outcome. Click back and tweak the introduction if you need to make any adjustments.

## Competition to Renderforest

Animoto and PowToon are a couple of the site's main rivals. These are excellent online video editing tools, but Renderforest stands out because it is simple to use and enables even novice users to create, share quickly, and download "broadcast grade videos."

**Renderforest vs PowToon**

One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It's challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.

PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn't provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.

PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.

Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.

Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.

Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.

Fortunately, you don't have to believe us. You may experience all the main advantages of Renderforest yourself by giving it a try. Check out the pros and drawbacks list in our Renderforest review if you need more assistance.

## How to Clone Yourself in Videos with Filmora?

With the help of video editing programs like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can create clones of yourself. Whether you're looking to create a funny skit or a serious video, cloning yourself can add much production value to your project.

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of how to clone yourself in videos using Filmora.

## Part 1: How to Film Clips for Cloning Effects?

To make cloning effects, you will need to take two different shots and use a tripod to place the camera, so the frame doesn't change.

**Shooting the first clip**

For the first shot, stay on one side of the frame and do the first action. For example, you can pretend to yank and take off your jacket. Then, drop the jacket to the other side of the frame.

![shooting the first clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-1.gif)

To make it more realistic, make an interaction by reacting to the "clone" while facing the other direction.

![make an interaction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-2.jpg)

**Shooting the second clip**

Then, shoot for the second clip without changing the frame. You will have to go to the place where you dropped the jacket from the first shot.

![shooting the second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-3.gif)

Act as if you have just appeared there and give a reaction to the other side as well.

## Part 2: How to Do the Clone Effect with Filmora?

After you have shot the necessary film clips, bring the clips into Filmora 11\. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can go to their website and download it here:

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Once you have opened Filmora 11, follow the steps below:

Step1 Bring the first clip to the timeline and cut the clip where you pretend to yank and take off the jacket. Select and delete the unnecessary clip.

![bring the first clip to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg)

Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let's start working on the clone part using masking.

First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the "clone."

![place the second clip on a different window track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg)

Then, double-click the second clip and go to the Filmora setting window. Tap on the **Mask** section > **Single line**.

![tap on mask section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-6.jpg)

On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show "the clone."

![adjust the position of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif)

Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.

Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn't match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11\. To use it, double-click the second clip and select **Speed > Speed Ramping > Customize**.

![double-click the second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-8.jpg)

Move the keyframe up to increase the speed. You can adjust it according to your needs.

![adjust keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-9.gif)

Step4 Once you are satisfied, adjust the clip length on the timeline and make sure that both clips finish at the same time.

![adjust the clip length](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-10.jpg)

**Extra tip:** Add one more effect to make it more magical.

Step1 Open the **Effects** window and search for "up down 1."

![open the effects window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-11.jpg)

Step2 Drag and drop the effect onto the timeline where the first cut is set. Adjust the effect length to match the action.

![drag and drop the effect onto the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-12.jpg)

Then, drag and drop the effect again in the transition between the first and the second clip. Adjust it to the appropriate length, then it will give a more dramatic effect.

Step3 You can playback and see how it looks on the preview screen.

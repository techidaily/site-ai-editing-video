Discord was a great alternative to voice chat systems such as TeamSpeak, Mumble, and Ventrilo for online gamers. Gamers **make discord accounts** for these services to play together rather than the voice communication facilities integrated into games, which are frequently of poor quality and lack functionality.

Founded in 2015, discord allowed individuals to talk while playing PC games seamlessly. Users may utilize the service to establish servers that can include many text and audio channels. A typical **discord account** server may feature chat rooms dedicated to specific themes (such as "gaming" and "anime x manga"), as well as voice channels devoted to specific games or activities. The service's high-quality, low-latency audio chat is a popular tool for Twitch broadcasters and podcasters. It has also expanded to accommodate massive video conversations to compete with Zoom.

Discord was a great alternative to voice chat systems such as TeamSpeak, Mumble, and Ventrilo for online gamers. Gamers **make discord accounts** for these services to play together rather than the voice communication facilities integrated into games, which are frequently of poor quality and lack functionality.

Founded in 2015, discord allowed individuals to talk while playing PC games seamlessly. Users may utilize the service to establish servers that can include many text and audio channels. A typical **discord account** server may feature chat rooms dedicated to specific themes (such as "gaming" and "anime x manga"), as well as voice channels devoted to specific games or activities. The service's high-quality, low-latency audio chat is a popular tool for Twitch broadcasters and podcasters. It has also expanded to accommodate massive video conversations to compete with Zoom.

### 4\. VN-Video Editor & Maker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/is/app/vn-video-editor/id1343581380)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frontrow.vlog&hl=en&gl=US))

If searching for an alternative like the **Efectum app, download without the watermark**; use this app. It satisfies the needs of professionals and amateur video editors with high-quality videos.

Another good option in place of the **Efectum app** that you can consider is InShot. This platform offers some AI features such as auto-caption, smart tracking, and AI effects. InShot enables you to make smooth slow-mo with a speed ramping feature and keyframe editing. Plus, you can create multi-layered videos with filters, transitions, and AI effects.

![video editor and maker inshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-9.jpg)

 Pros

* Make photo collages with AI effects and blend screenshots with AI context recognition.
* Export videos in 4K resolution to YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp.

 Cons

* Impose a watermark on videos unless you pay to remove it, which annoys many users.

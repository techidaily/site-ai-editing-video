But, I’ll provide an explanation to get the cropped video that you want.

## Method 1: Cropping a Video using After Effects

After Effects is a professional motion graphics tool that can create outputs that are beyond the limits of reality. Like the other Adobe tools, this comes with a subscription fee to be able to maximize this product. But, is the price worth the risk? The “ Adobe” brand is known for its quality applications and customer’s satisfaction.

Let’s start with using this tool. The situation is that you want to crop your video using Adobe After Effects but you don’t know how to start. Search for the application on your computer. Launch it, then click the **New Project**. If you have files from your storage then select the **New Composition Footage.**

Check if the video is already in the interface. Find the **Magnifying** tab and zoom out the video into 50%. After that, click the **Grid** icon and **Proportional Grid**.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-2.jpg)

Click the **Square** icon, it is located beside the **Pencil** icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the **Proportiona**l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

Following that, hit the **Output To** part and decide the destination and folder where you want it to be.

Congratulations on making your first cropped video using After Effects! What was your experience while following through the guide? I hope that the information presented here is easy to understand and implement.

click the **Import.**

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-7.png)

An alternative way is by right clicking the video clip .Under the **Video** tab you can select the **Crop and Zoom** or **Crop to Fit** then adjust to your preferred ratio.

## The Bottom Line

You are once again done with the process of checking out these two applications. After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs. The interface also could change your mind depending if you want simplicity or a challenge. Price is also a factor that can affect your willingness to use these applications. But, this guide clearly shows you that it is worth paying for.

What are your thoughts on both of these tools? Did you find this information to be helpful?

## Part 1\. Types of Video Effects on Adobe Premiere Pro

A video editing program called Adobe Premiere Pro can be used to create everything from TV programs and movies to advertisements and family videos. These effects include Transitions, VFX, Audio, Videos as well as Advanced level effects like Green Screen. In addition, to know how to add shake effect in premiere pro, we’ve explained in the upcoming steps.

For editors who don't want to utilize the other motion graphic packages, Premiere provides a ton of built-in effects. Here are a few effects that you may not be aware are available to you. Any filmmaker or content producer must understand how to apply effects since they are necessary for a top-notch video. We've compiled easy steps on applying effects in Premiere Pro to be of assistance.

## Part 2\. How to Add Effects in Premier Pro

### Add Transition Effects

There are several transition effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, and there are countless ways to customize them to fit your film. It is quite easy to locate transitions and add them. The Effects panel, which is accessible from the very top options bar, contains all the transition options. A panel will show up on the right when you choose this. To include a transition, adhere to these procedures.

* Navigate to the Video Transitions area of the Effects panel.

![transition effects in pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/transition-effects-in-pr.jpg)

* Select the desired transition type from any of the available ones When you wish to employ a transition, press and hold it before dragging it to the start or finish of the clip. Alternately, insert it in between two clips to serve as a transition between the start and finish of each.

![drag and apply transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-and-apply-transitions-pr.jpg)

* In Premiere, there are several possible transitions, and some can be more suitable for your project than others.

### Add Visual Effects

The Essential Graphics panel was added by Adobe to Premiere Pro. Users now have a much different workflow than they had with the few prior title panels. Now that everything is in one panel, you can easily create, animate, and use VFX. Some of the VFX shots were just building miniature towns and adding pieces, while others involved the standard green screen removal and backdrop replacement.

* Simply importing and uploading your video and audio files into Premiere Pro is the first step. The procedure of clicking through is fairly simple. Choose "New Project." Press the Media Browser panel button and find the Ultra Key tool by opening the Effects panel.

![press meida browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-meida-browser.jpg)

* The film clip with the green screen should have the Ultra Key added. Utilizing the matte creation and matte cleaning tools, remove the green screen using the ultra key effect. When softening, be cautious to eliminate any sharp edges. All of this can be adjusted under the Effects Control panel.

![ultra key effect pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ultra-key-effect-pr.jpg)

* Put your backdrop material behind your green screen clip after you have a clear key. You should now be able to view your backdrop behind the keyed layer.

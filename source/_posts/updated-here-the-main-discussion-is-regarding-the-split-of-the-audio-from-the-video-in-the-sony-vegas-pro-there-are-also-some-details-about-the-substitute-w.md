## How to Stabilize Videos for Free with Google Photos App

While recording a video, it is pretty normal if you don’t end up having a stabilized clip due to camera shakes or movements on an unstable and unpaved road. This is where the **Google stabilizer video** editing feature comes into play. You can stabilize a video with the Google Photos app that has a built-in video stabilizer and other editing tools to give a finishing touch to your media files before they are shared online or with family, friends, and/or colleagues.

In this article, we will show you how to use Google Photos as a **stabilizer video Google** offers to its consumer. In addition, you will also learn about one of the most trusted and efficient third-party tools to stabilize the clips if **Google video stabilizer** fails to produce quality output.

#### In this article

01 [What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?](#part1)

02 [How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?](#part2)

03 [How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos Online?](#part3)

04 [How to Use Google Photos to Edit Video?](#part4)

## Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?

Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.

The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if/when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.

**1\. History and Current Policies**

Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.

**2\. Accessibility**

Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.

**3\. Deletion**

The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.

## Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?

Google Photos is available for both Android and iPhone smartphones, and as explained earlier, the app can be downloaded from Play Store and App Store respectively. Using the built-in **Google stabilizer video** editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.

You can learn how to work with **Google video stabilizer** to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos**

Download and install Google Photos on your smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations). Launch the app, tap **Library** from the bottom-right corner of the interface, and tap to open the source video that you want to stabilize with **Google video stabilizer**.

![open video to stabilize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-video-to-stabilize.jpg)

**Step 2: Stabilize the Video**

After the video opens in the app and the playback begins, tap **Edit** from the bottom. On the next screen, ensure that the **Video** section is selected. Tap the **Stabilize** icon from the lower-left area of the window, and wait while **Google Photos stabilize video**.

![stabilize video with google photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stabilize-video-with-google-photos.jpg)

**Step 3: Save the Video**

Once the stabilization process is complete, click **Save copy** from the bottom-right corner to save the modified video as a separate copy, thus leaving the original instance intact.

![save stabilized video in google photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-stabilized-video-in-google-photos.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos Online?

Unfortunately, Google Photos doesn’t have many editing options when accessed via a web browser, and therefore, at the time of this writing, you cannot stabilize a video with the tool’s web interface. But if you are using a Windows or Mac computer, you can try some [free online video stabilization software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or use [Wondershare Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to stabilize video with one click.

![media library interface filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-library-interface-filmora.jpg)

Now, drag and drop the video to the timeline, or hover the mouse over the clip’s thumbnail in the **Media** window, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right area. Click the button under the **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** label when the confirmation box comes up to add the film to the Timeline using the preferences that you selected.

## Part 4: How to Use Google Photos to Edit Video?

Google Photos doesn’t only work as a **Google video stabilizer** app but it also enables you to edit your media clips much more professionally. Some post-production tasks that you can perform while using Google Photos include:

**1\. Trimming**

The trimming handles can be seen when you are on the ‘Video’ section after tapping ‘Edit’ in Google Photos after opening the video. You can drag these handles inwards to get rid of the unwanted starting and ending parts of a clip.

![google photos trim video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-trim-video.jpg)

**2\. Cropping**

The ‘Crop’ section enables you to crop the videos in a particular aspect ratio that can be selected from the available list, or drag the handles manually to get custom results.

![google photos crop video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-crop-video.jpg)

## How to Add Customized Transitions to OBS

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

![add stinger obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-stinger-obs.jpg)

Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.

![name stinger transition obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/name-stinger-transition-obs.jpg)

Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.

![apply cut transition effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg)

Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.

![select transition point field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg)

Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.

![audio monitor output obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-monitor-output-obs.jpg)

Step7 Scroll down and click on Preview Transition button to check if the stinger transition is taking place as expected. You can adjust the transition point and other parameters to get it perfect.

![preview stinger transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-stinger-transition.jpg)

Step8 Finally, click on Ok button and play the video to check out the stinger transition on the big screen.

The steps on how to add a custom transition to Streamlabs OBS are almost similar, and therefore, you can add stinger transition using Streamlabs comfortably.

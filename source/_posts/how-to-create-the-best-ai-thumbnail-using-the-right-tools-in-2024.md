## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 2: Different Sony Cameras Offering S&Q Feature

There is no lack of devices that help you capture any scene with perfection. Someone obsessed with videography can understand the worth of a high-quality camera. Sony launched two such products named A7iii and **Sony ZV E10 slow motion**. Both are high-output, professional-grade cameras to assist in slo-mo creation. Here is a brief review of these cameras for you to compare and select better:

### 1\. Sony A7 III

## Part 3: How to Slow Down Video in Sony Vegas Pro?

[Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/) stands amongst the top video editors who excel at creating slow motions. With its powerful speed manipulation, it can curate cinematic slo-mo effects. In addition, the tool offers an Optical Flow option for ultra-high-quality slomos. It offers a non-linear timeline editing, which means selective durations to apply this effect. Given below is the step-by-step guide to **Sony V** **egas** [**slow motion**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:**

##### Step 1

After launching the software, import the video and bring it to the timeline.

![import media in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-videos-with-sony-sq-7.jpg)

##### Step 2

Navigate towards the editing panel where the clip and audio track are showing. Place your cursor at the finishing line of the clip and stretch it throughout the timeline. This will add a slow-motion effect to your video.

![drag the import media in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-videos-with-sony-sq-8.jpg)

## Part 4: Wondershare Filmora: Comprehending the Best Alternative for Slowing Down Videos

All the above slow-motion solutions are adequate but not reliable. This is because shooting in **So** **ny** **S&** **Q mode** declines video quality upon export. In addition, the **Sony** **Vegas slow motion** subscription plans start at more than $500\. This seems expensive for someone who just started editing and is a beginner.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the perfect alternative to **S** **ony** **ZY** **E10 slow motion** and other devices. It offers an intuitive speed change interface at affordable prices. In addition, there is more than one method to alter its speed with optical flow. Moreover, the software offers extensive export settings to set video resolution.

Let us help you with that. Here are 5 Call of Duty: Warzone thumbnails you should check out.

It is cool and sure to attract the attention of the COD: Warzone demographics.

### 2\. TOP 300 FUNNIEST FAILS IN WARZONE

![warzone thumbnail by red arcade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-2.JPG)

This video is made by [Red Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1UFojIiiK8). It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can't say that the thumbnail did not help. It's actually really good.

The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player's character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words "AFK. Don't shoot!" are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It's more "funny" than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.

### 3\. Clean House \[PS5 UHD 4K\] Next-Gen Ultra Realistic Graphics PlayStation 5 Call of Duty Gameplay

![warzone thumbnail by hedgehog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-3.JPG)

The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you're also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.

### 4\. Call of Duty: Warzone Battle Royale | RTX 3080 10GB ( 4K Maximum Settings Ray Tracing OFF )

![warzone thumbnail by gtx 1050 ti](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-4.JPG)

The thumbnail for this video (made by [GTX 1050 Ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9zMSBcius)), with 5.2 million views, is just an in-game screenshot. At the top-right is a large logo of GEFORCE RTX 3080 and at the bottom left is an Intel logo. Like the previous one, it attracts viewers by stating the visual appeal of the video.

### 5\. NEW RECORD! 64 KILL GAME in CoD WARZONE! (Best Classes / Loadouts)

Players are attracted to amazing gameplay. Unsurprisingly, the player who got 64 kills got 3.1 million views in his video. The gist is that if you have achieved something amazing, try to incorporate it into the thumbnail.

## How to Remove Echo From Videos with Adobe Audition

With its various potent tools, Adobe Audition enables audio producers to obtain the absolute best results from their recordings. **Adobe Audition removes echo** and will have something that will assist you in bringing everything back under control so that your audio sounds great, regardless of whether the problem is unruly instruments or rowdy hosts.

When recording audio, there are numerous factors to consider. Some spaces can generate more reverb than others, like a cluttered echo effect due to various factors, including reflective surfaces, distant objects, and large, cavernous spaces. This will allow you to **remove echo auditions** for use in podcasts, movies, and musical compositions.

![adobe audition removes echo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Remove Echo with Adobe Audition?

Producers may use various compelling features in Adobe Audition to get the most out of your audio. Whether rogue hosts or instruments, Adobe Audition has a solution to help you regain control and make your audio sound great. We'll demonstrate how to eliminate echo in Adobe Audition in this tutorial. **Adobe Auditions can reduce echo** from your video files in a few steps. Want to learn how?

Well, here are the five prime steps.

##### Step1 Pick Audio

Load the project you are currently working on in Audition, and then choose the audio file with the echo that needs removal. Choose a segment of the waveform that is relatively quiet to eliminate some of the ambient noise that your camera or another nearby device may have caused.

Select "Capture Noise Print" from the contextual menu visible when you right-click on the portion. This will assist the Audition in differentiating the primary audio from any background noise.

##### Step2 Begin Noise Removal

Select the noise that you want to get rid of, and then go to "Effects" > "Noise Reduction / Restoration" > "Noise Reduction (process)." After selecting "Select Entire File," play your audio file again to see whether the background noise got eliminated.

You may also make the gating effect more noticeable by going to the Advanced tab and lowering the Spectral Decay Rate. When satisfied with the adjustments, you may make them permanent by clicking the "Apply" button.

![noise reduction and restoration adobe audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Add Effects

Next, choose "Dynamics Processing" from the "Effects" menu after clicking on "Amplitude and Compression."

This will load an effect like compression, which you can then utilize to modify the waveform. You should be able to see a diagonal line that extends from one side of the Dynamics Processing display to the other when you first launch the program. It will affect the echo if you drag on this line so tiny that it bends below the default route. You will need to experiment with the line's location and compare the new audio to the old one until you get a satisfactory result.

##### Step4 Apply Effect

After adjusting the Dynamics Processing settings to your satisfaction, ensure that your complete waveform is chosen before clicking the OK button to apply the effect.

Your audio's amplitude, or loudness, will reduce as a result; however, you may restore the original level by selecting "Effects" > "Amplitude and Compression" > "Normalize" from the menu bar.

![amplitude and compression adobe audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-3.jpg)

##### Step5 Clean Up the Audio

Finally, clean up some of the frequencies the echo has produced since they are murky and irritating.

Select "Effects" followed by "Filter and EQ" and then "Parametric Equalizer" from the menu. You will get access to seven primary frequency bands to work with by default and a low-pass and high-pass band devoted to their respective functions. We need a few bands to eliminate those undesirable frequencies in the middle.

When you hear a harsh sound, start by amplifying one band (and the Q value of that band), then gently proceed across the frequency range until you reach the next band. After that, bring the band below 0 dB so that it may remove some of the roughness.

## Part 2: How to Remove Echo in an Easy and Free Way?

Although a great deal of software is available to eliminate echo, the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Video Editor is the one we suggest you use. Let's go right down to the meat of the matter. It can **remove echo auditions** and any other background noise.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The newly released version of Filmora includes enhanced waveforms, volume keyframing, peak metering, and audio transitions in addition to the standard audio editing tools. All of these improvements contribute to a more satisfying and high-quality audio editing experience for the user. Here are some advantages of Getting Rid of Echo and Other Background Audio Noise Using Filmora:

* You may adjust the height of the track for more accurate audio manipulation of waveforms.
* Using only one click, the Denoise function may eliminate any unwanted background noise.
* Adjusting the Denoise level to either weak, mid, or strong may provide much improved results in terms of noise reduction.

Filmora Video Editor makes it simple to eliminate background noise from an audio recording or a video recording. It can even do both simultaneously. You may separate the audio from the movie using this user-friendly video editor, then use the Audio Mixer or Audio Equalizer tools to make additional adjustments to the audio. Finally, you can Export the audio in MP3 format after editing it. The specific steps are listed down below.

##### Step1 Run Filmora and Import Video

Import your video into Wondershare Filmora's timeline pane. A video preview can help you see the portions you don't wish to keep can be edited out and removed.

##### Step2 Choose Detach Audio

A drop-down option will appear when you right-click the video in the timeline. Choose "Audio" from the list. Silence detection, audio modification, audio disconnect, and mute are the four choices you'll see. If you wish to separate the audio from the video, choose "Detach Audio" from the drop-down menu.

![remove background noise from the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-4.jpg)

##### Step3 Tick Remove Background Noise

Double-click the audio track, then choose the Edit panel and the "Remove background noise" option to remove the background noise instantly.

![remove background noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-5.jpg)

To access the Editing panel without first separating the audio from the video, you may alternatively double-click the video clip in the timeline. Selecting the Audio tab in the Editing panel may adjust the audio and eliminate the noise.

##### Step4 Fine Tune and Export

You may also make minor adjustments to the audio by utilizing the editor's Equalizer feature to give it a more realistic tone. To enhance the overall effect, frame-by-frame adjusts the audio to match the picture. You may instantly post the video to YouTube or Vimeo after seeing the findings or click the Export option to save it to your PC with the noise reduction performed.

## Part 3: Recording Tips: How to Record Without Echo?

Now that you know how to use **Adobe Audition to remove echo** let's share some tips to help you record without an echo.

So, here are a few recording tips.

1. **Keep things quiet**. When recording audio, pay more attention to the peaceful sounds in the background. There may be humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, or jingling from your pet's collar. Pay attention to where you are recording and find ways to shut down anything else.
2. **Put your mobile phone in airplane mode**. Phones send out signals when they receive calls or do searches in the background that the recording system can pick up. By putting your phones in "airplane mode," you can stop them from making noises during good takes.
3. **Minimize echo**. Set up your recording space, so your voice stays on the walls only a little and back to your microphone. Use things that soak up the sound instead of reflecting it, like a thick rug or a comforter. You can make your voice echo in post-production if you want it to.
4. **Upgrade your microphone**. The hardware you use will be the most significant limit to what you can record. You can improve your recordings by plugging an external microphone into the microphone jack on your camera or with a professional microphone to record the sound separately.
5. **Adjust your levels**. Before you hit the record button, check to see how loud the sound you want to record is. Adjust your levels (the sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound is between -6 DBS and -12 DBS. This range allows your sound room's source to get louder without the recorded sound getting cut off. Don't worry because you can always increase the editing volume.
6. **Start with a sound cue**. If you're recording separate audio that you'll later sync to your video, start your recording with a short, loud sound like a clap or a high-pitched "beep." Later, while editing, finding the part where your video and the additional audio match will be much easier.
7. **Move toward the sound**. Move your microphone close to the sound you want to record. The closer your microphone is to the sound source, the lower you can set your microphone's sensitivity. If you turn down your levels, sounds you don't want to record will also sound less loud.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1\. How do you remove echo from recording?

**Removing Echo in Audacity with Noise Gate:** Choose the track you want to work on, go to the Effects menu, and look for the Noise Gate plug-in (scroll down a bit). Check to see that Gate is on Select Function. Use the preview to change the settings. When happy with the effect, click OK to apply it to the whole audio file.

### 2\. How do you remove echo from a microphone?

Lessen the volume of your speakers to get rid of the echo. If your microphone or audio device is close to a wall or other surface that reflects sound but doesn't absorb it, you should move the microphone away from the surface or change its direction. Additionally, you can use **Wondershare Filmora** or **Adobe Audition echo removal** technique.

## Conclusion

There are many ways to dig deeper and improve your audio quality if you are more ambitious or your recordings have many echoes.

But no matter what you do, **Adobe Audition reduces echo**, and you can look forward to recordings without an echo.

The newly released version of Filmora includes enhanced waveforms, volume keyframing, peak metering, and audio transitions in addition to the standard audio editing tools. All of these improvements contribute to a more satisfying and high-quality audio editing experience for the user. Here are some advantages of Getting Rid of Echo and Other Background Audio Noise Using Filmora:

* You may adjust the height of the track for more accurate audio manipulation of waveforms.
* Using only one click, the Denoise function may eliminate any unwanted background noise.
* Adjusting the Denoise level to either weak, mid, or strong may provide much improved results in terms of noise reduction.

Filmora Video Editor makes it simple to eliminate background noise from an audio recording or a video recording. It can even do both simultaneously. You may separate the audio from the movie using this user-friendly video editor, then use the Audio Mixer or Audio Equalizer tools to make additional adjustments to the audio. Finally, you can Export the audio in MP3 format after editing it. The specific steps are listed down below.

##### Step1 Run Filmora and Import Video

Import your video into Wondershare Filmora's timeline pane. A video preview can help you see the portions you don't wish to keep can be edited out and removed.

##### Step2 Choose Detach Audio

A drop-down option will appear when you right-click the video in the timeline. Choose "Audio" from the list. Silence detection, audio modification, audio disconnect, and mute are the four choices you'll see. If you wish to separate the audio from the video, choose "Detach Audio" from the drop-down menu.

![remove background noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-5.jpg)

##### Step4 Fine Tune and Export

You may also make minor adjustments to the audio by utilizing the editor's Equalizer feature to give it a more realistic tone.

You may instantly post the video to YouTube or Vimeo after seeing the findings or click the Export option to save it to your PC with the noise reduction performed.

## Part 3: Recording Tips: How to Record Without Echo?

Now that you know how to use **Adobe Audition to remove echo** let's share some tips to help you record without an echo.

So, here are a few recording tips.

1. **Keep things quiet**. When recording audio, pay more attention to the peaceful sounds in the background. There may be humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, or jingling from your pet's collar. Pay attention to where you are recording and find ways to shut down anything else.
2. **Put your mobile phone in airplane mode**. Phones send out signals when they receive calls or do searches in the background that the recording system can pick up. By putting your phones in "airplane mode," you can stop them from making noises during good takes.
3. **Minimize echo**. Set up your recording space, so your voice stays on the walls only a little and back to your microphone. Use things that soak up the sound instead of reflecting it, like a thick rug or a comforter. You can make your voice echo in post-production if you want it to.
4. **Upgrade your microphone**. The hardware you use will be the most significant limit to what you can record. You can improve your recordings by plugging an external microphone into the microphone jack on your camera or with a professional microphone to record the sound separately.
5. **Adjust your levels**. Before you hit the record button, check to see how loud the sound you want to record is. Adjust your levels (the sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound is between -6 DBS and -12 DBS. This range allows your sound room's source to get louder without the recorded sound getting cut off. Don't worry because you can always increase the editing volume.
6. **Start with a sound cue**. If you're recording separate audio that you'll later sync to your video, start your recording with a short, loud sound like a clap or a high-pitched "beep." Later, while editing, finding the part where your video and the additional audio match will be much easier.
7. **Move toward the sound**. Move your microphone close to the sound you want to record. The closer your microphone is to the sound source, the lower you can set your microphone's sensitivity. If you turn down your levels, sounds you don't want to record will also sound less loud.

## Converting an SRT (SRT/Sorted Reader) Into a DOCX File Is a Process. Here We Will Discuss Converting a Set File to a Docx File and More Details About This

**SRT to Word: How to Convert an SRT File to Docx file?**

The SubRip Text (SRT) format is a popular subtitle format used in many videos. While SRT files are simple text files that can be edited with any text editor, they are not as convenient to work with as MS Word documents.

For one thing, it cannot be easy to format text in a way that is easy to read. In addition, SRT files do not support features such as spell checking and grammar checking.

As a result, converting SRT to Word can be a useful way to improve the quality of subtitles. In addition, it can also make it easier to translate subtitles into other languages.

Other than that, you might need to convert an SRT to a Word document when you need to edit the subtitles for a video you're working on or you want to create a transcript of a recorded conversation.

You might think that converting a speech to text is difficult or impossible. But it's not!

## Convert SRT to Word file Manually

You must first remove the time codes to convert an SRT file to a Word document. Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

Keep in mind that this manual method will not retain any formatting from the original SRT file, so you may need to do some additional editing to get the final results you want.

## Convert SRT to Word file Manually

You must first remove the time codes to convert an SRT file to a Word document. Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

Keep in mind that this manual method will not retain any formatting from the original SRT file, so you may need to do some additional editing to get the final results you want.

## Enhance Your Video Color Accuracy with Video Scopes

All video editors have been there. You edit and color-correct your video project only to find out that the final product is not what you expected. The contract and colors dramatically shift when viewed on a different device. In most cases, this is caused by improperly calibrated monitors, but it could also be your eyes playing tricks on you. **Video scopes** help in preventing this problem ensuring that the color in your video is consistent across devices. With video editing scope, you get the exact representation of the elements that make up your image, including lightness and color values. In this article, we explain what video scopes are and how you can use them in your editing projects.

## **Part 1\. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them**

When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.

![video scopes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-1.JPG)

Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:

* **Increased Accuracy**: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments
* **Reliability**: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.
* **Professional Editing**: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.
* **Matching Color Between Shots**: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.

Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.

## **Part 2\. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones**

Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:

* [Waveform Scopes](#scope1)
* [Histogram](#scope2)
* [RGB Parade](#scope3)
* [Vector Scopes](#scope4)

### **1\. Waveform Scopes**

Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-2.JPG)

### **2\. Histogram**

The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0\. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-3.JPG)

### **3\. RGB Parade**

This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.

![rgb parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-4.JPG)

### **4\. Vector Scopes**

This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.

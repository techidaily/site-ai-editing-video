## Want to Learn How to Make a Fortnite Montage? This Guide Will Give You the Low-Down on Creating Epic Montage Fortnite Videos that You Can Share with Other Players on Social Media Platforms

If you're skilled at playing Fortnite, you'll probably want to share your gameplay clips as montages with other players. The popularity of Fortnite montage videos is rapidly growing because millions of people play the game. Tons of people also like watching their peers play this online video game in the form of gaming montages. We'll explain how to make a montage Fortnite that will get views when you upload it on social media platforms.

## What Is Fortnite?

Fortnite is a popular online game developed by the American game studio Epic Games. The video game was released in 2017, and it's available in three-game mode versions with the same game engine and gameplay. These are:

* Fortnite: Save the World: Set on contemporary Earth, Save the World is a co-op hybrid third-person shooter (TPS), tower defense (TD), and survival game. The game allows a maximum of four players to fight off creatures that look like zombies and defend objects with traps or fortifications they have built.
* Fortnite Battle Royale: This is a free-to-play (F2P) battle royale video game that allows up to one hundred players to fight against each other until only one person remains.
* Fortnite Creative: Released in 2018, Fortnite Creative allows players to create battle arenas and worlds. They can then share these predetermined structures with up to 16 other players for a range of multiplayer game modes that have customizable rules.

Since its release, Fortnite has become a worldwide phenomenon, with more than 350 million people playing the game across the globe. In the first year of Fortnite's release, players downloaded its mobile version 78 million times.

The game became such a global hit because it's free to play. It's also available on most gaming platforms and features an engaging theme. Additionally, because Battle Royale allows up to 100 gamers to fight it out until they find the last man standing, this means the replayability of this online video game is infinite. What's more? Each game is unique.

Fortnite has also become popular because users can purchase DLC (downloadable content) to enhance their gaming experience.

## Things to Prepare before making a Fortnite Montage video

You have to prepare several things if you want to make an epic Fortnite montage video that will keep your audience watching. These include:

### 1\. Fortnite Gaming Clips

Epic Games developed a system that allows you to save your best gameplay performances. You can then export the Fortnite replays that you have saved.

To save the beautiful moments of the game, you have to know where to find the Replays videos; this is how to find them:

1. Head over to Career and select the Replays option. You'll see all the replay clips, including their date, finish, and length.

### 2\. Pick the Right Background Music

To make your Fortnite montage video engaging, you'll need to choose background music that fits your montage videos. Music is one of the key elements in creating an exhilarating viewing experience for your audience.

Make sure you pick royalty-free music that fits the genre of your Fortnite montage video. Choose a song that expresses the themes and personality of the game.

You cannot use your favorite song from the radio, as your copyright law prohibits people from using the work of others without permission or paying a royalty.

If you are caught using copyrighted music, you might have to pay the music owner monetary damages. You can also go to jail because of copyright infringement.

There are loads of platforms that offer non-copyrighted music that you can use in your montage Fortnite. These include YouTube, Twitch, and Pixabay.

### 3\. Choose the Correct Video Editing Software

Now that you have downloaded all the Fortnite video clips and saved them on your computer, you need to choose the correct video editing software. Here are three of the most reliable programs that you can use to make a montage Fortnite video.

Now it's time to select the audio mode.

##### Step6Select the audio mode

The audio mixer of Filmora provides you with two audio mode options. These are;

● **Stereo Mode**

In the Stereo mode, you can pan from left to right and control your audio just like the knob of the audio channel.

● **Surround Mode**

You can pan from left to right and front to back in this mode by rotating the video or music icons. This provides you with complete control over the audio positions. But remember that this mode works best if your video is played with the surround sound system.

![select the mode of your audio tracks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/select-the-mode-of-your-audio-tracks.jpg)

Once you have changed the audio mode, let's look at the master levels.

##### Step7Adjust the master levels

On the very left of the window, you'll find the Master levels.

This is where you can adjust the master section or all your audio files on your timeline.

* Just drag the master level slider upward and downwards, and you'll notice the changes right away.

## Step by Step to Rotate Videos in Windows Media Player

Video Editing and the emotion the final product evokes is dependent on many aspects, be it the source clips, the cuts introduced or the way of presentation. But to get to the end, there are several steps involved in the production process, and not every instance of it is perfect. But we all know, editing does often help iron out any kinks, with its ability to solve basic problems, like footage that is askew, or upside down. Thus with the steps listed in this article we will help you understand how you can rotate videos to ensure your edited project looks as intended.

This particular article considers the pre-installed Windows Media Player and WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with Windows Media Player_ _(on a device running Windows 10_ _) and WonderShare Filmora._

## How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?

Imagine you’re in a situation where you have gone ahead and finished the filming portion of a project on your smartphone but realise that the capture footage is upside down. Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.

Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, _you will not be able to rotate the clip_. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.

Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.

### **TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER**

In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.

While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.

To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.

* Click on Organize.
* Then move onto Manage Libraries
* Now click on Videos.

Find the software on your computer and don’t be overwhelmed by the interface.

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-1.jpeg)

Then click the **Media and** select **Open File** to choose the video that you want to crop. You should prepare the videos that you want to be cropped and rename them to avoid confusion.

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-2.jpeg)

Click the **Tools** on the menu and select the **Effects and Filters.**

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-3.jpeg)

After that, click on the **Video Effects** and under that select **Crop.** Doing this, will open the cropping editor.

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-4.jpeg)

You need to enter specific pixels on the **left**, **right, top** and **bottom**. This will depend on your preferences. If it is your first time and you don’t know the exact pixels then just input what you think would be enough.

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-5.jpeg)

After entering your preferred pixels, you can preview it. If you would like to adjust then just simply repeat entering the specific pixels.

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-6.jpeg)

You decided to save the cropped video. Find the **Tools** menu and select **Preferences**.

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-7.jpeg)

Find the **Show settings** and click **All.** In the **search bar** type **Croppadd** then save your previous preferred pixel settings. Lastly, click **Save**.

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-8.jpeg)

In the **Media** menu select the **Convert/Save**. You can drag and drop the cropped video to the **File** box.

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-9.jpeg)

You can select your file format and codecs by clicking **Convert/Save.**

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-10.jpeg)

Find the **Edit Selected Profile** and click the **Video Codec.** Then under the **Filters** tab, select the **Video cropping filter.** Finally, click **Save.**

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-11.jpeg)

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-12.jpeg)

Then click **Start.**

![crop-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-vlc-13.jpeg)

Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.

Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately.

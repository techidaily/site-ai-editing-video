## Consider a LUT to Be a Color Preset that a Filmmaker Can Use to Start Working on a Project Quickly. Sony Engineers Have Developed LUTs to Help Filmmakers Perform Specific Tasks. All of These Are Available for Free

If you've ever worked in the color grading profession, you're aware of how time-consuming and labor-intensive it is to achieve a specific look on a scene. To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.

Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image's colors.

## Benefits of using LUTs

There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We've already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.

### 1\. A beginning towards professionalism

This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.

You'll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You'll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.

However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.

### 2\. It saves your time

Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn't the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.

However, there's a good probability that it won't look the same in all of the images. This is where you'll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It's nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.

### 3\. Work on a budget

Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I'm sure we've all done at some point.

Whether it's a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.

### 4\. It provides an artistic approach

LUTs are beneficial because they allow videos shot with cameras that shoot very dark, discolored images to have more vivid tones and contrast. This is excellent for grabbing viewers' attention and making videos more intriguing and engaging. LUTs add an artistic element to videos and can help you develop a visual artistic identity for your videos if you use the same colors. Another advantage of LUTs is that they enhance the color quality of videos shot on smartphones with particular color schemes. Although this varies significantly from brand to brand, you can use LUTs to make a Smartphone video more vibrant and appealing.

## How to Use 3D Camera Tracking Effects in After Effects

Adobe After Effects is an ever-growing product, with new features introduced almost every year. One of these features is the 3D **Camera Tracking,** which allows you to take your motion graphic effects to the next level.

**Camera Tracking** is extracting the camera movement from a recorded video sequence. This process allows filmmakers to add computer-generated elements to a live action shot, track objects throughout a shot for compositing, and estimate camera movements for virtual reality applications.

In this article, we will explore what Camera **Tracking** is and Motion Tracking in After Effect. We'll also show you how to use 3D Camera Tracking in After Effects on a Windows PC.

## Part 1\. What Is Camera Tracking

Camera Tracking is a process that determines the movement of a video clip. This information can be used to add certain effects to the video, such as objects that seem to follow the camera or text that appears to be stationary in the frame.

Camera Tracking is a relatively simple process, but it can be time-consuming. However, the results are often worth the effort, as it can add a whole new level of realism to your footage clips.

For example, you have taken a video clip of a zoo and want to add an object to it while making sure it gives a realistic look. This is where the **Camera Tracking** feature can help you make a smooth transition and add the element as if it was there.

## Part 2\. Why Use Camera Tracking?

Now that you know what Camera Tracking is, let's have a look at some benefits of using it:

* Add a 3D object or element to a 2D video clip.
* Embed objects, texts, etc., to a video.
* Stabilize a shaky camera/video clip.
* Create special effects.
* Apply color grading.
* Replace a TV or PC screen with some information.

Thus, if you need some basic compositions or advanced ones, the Camera Tracking feature will help you track your videos, embed anything you want, or create special effects to make your clip different.

## Part 3\. Motion Tracking In After Effects

The Motion Tracking capability is Adobe After Effects' feature that allows you to track the movement of the camera/an object in a video clip and use the data to add effects to objects.

Motion tracking can be used for various effects, like creating realistic text animations or adding special effects to objects in a video.

There are four main types of Motion Tracking in After Effects, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:

### Single Point Tracking

Single Point tracking tracks a single position in a video clip. You can use it for composing a video clip with a single point of focus, and it is suitable for following the movement of an object with right-left or up-down motion.

**Advantage:** Single Point Tracking is perfect for tracking a single position or motion of a single object.

**Disadvantage:** No scale or rotation properties and needs a clear contrast point for effective results.

### Two Point Tracking

Two Point Tracking is a feature that allows you to track two points in a footage clip and can be used for scale, motion, and rotation tracking.

**Advantage:** Two Point Tracking can track scale and rotation along with the motion.

**Disadvantage:** It doesn't give effective results with a shaky video clip.

### Four Point Tracking

The Four Point Tracking feature lets you track four different points (corners) in your footage and apply the tracking data to a layer in your composition.

The four points can be placed at the screen's corners in your shot, and new footage is applied to cover the screen.

**Advantage:** Directly pins the data to each corner of the image.

**Disadvantage:** Cannot be used to create a 3D object.

### 3D Camera Tracking

With 3D camera tracking, you can track the movement of a camera in a video and place 3D elements in the scene that match the camera's movement. This is a great way to add realism to your graphics and make them look like they're part of the scene.

**Advantage:** 3D Camera Tracking can help you add shapes, texts, or 3D objects to 2D footage.

**Disadvantage:** A bit tricky and needs an expert grip on the tool to use effectively.

## Part 4\. How To Use 3D Camera Tracking In After Effects Of Windows

Here's a simple and quick rundown of how to use 3D camera tracking in After Effects:

##### Step1Import Your Video Footage

Launch **Adobe After Effects**, create a new composition, and import your footage. Once your clip is uploaded, click the **Window Menu.** Scroll down and choose **"Tracker."**

![importing the video footage and heading to the tracker option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/importing-the-video-footage-and-heading-to-the-tracker-option.jpg)

Here you will see four tracking options:

1. Track Camera
2. Warp Stabilizer
3. Track Motion
4. Stabilize Motion

![the four tracking options in 3D camera tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/the-four-tracking-options-in-3D-camera-tracking.png)

Click **"Track Camera"** to add the 3D Camera Tracker effect to your selected layer. After Effects will start analyzing the layer, show the percentage, and count the total frames of clips tracked.

**Note:** The dots that appear on your video clips cannot be rendered out, as they are strictly referential.

![the referential dots on the video footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/the-referential-dots-on-the-video-footage.png)

##### Step2Establish The Tracking Points

You have to select the tracking points and a plane to which it must be tracked. To do this, hover over the tracking point references in the **After Effect compositions window**. Between the three tracking points, a triangle will form, and a red **"target"** will appear to help you better visualize the plane.

Now, you have to find a **tracking point** that lays the red **"target"** parallel to your selected plane. Next, select the triangle that lines up best for your surface. Move the **arrow** away to disable the picker and stop the red **"target."**

![establishing the tracking points and plane](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/establishing-the-tracking-points-and-plane.png)

##### Step3Add The Text To Your Video Clip

Once you define the plane, it's time to add text to your video clip. To do this, right-click on the **triangle** you have set previously, and a window will appear, allowing you to create new layers.

Click **"Create Text"** to place the text on your tracked video clip. A new text layer will be added using the tracking data.

![adding text to the video footage in the after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-text-to-the-video-footage-in-the-after-effects.png)

##### Step4Align Text On Tracked Footage

Now you have to align your text. In the timeline, locate the **tracked text layer** and click the **arrow** to the left to unveil all the editable properties for the layer.

Click the **"Transform"** option to use the transform options and use the layer lines to adjust the **X, Y, and Scale** values afterward.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can select your layer and press the S, P, R, or T keys to adjust the scale, position, rotation, and opacity, respectively.

Your text will now be added to your video footage. The method is similar to adding solid or null to your clips. However, the exact steps might differ a little.

## Motion Tracking Using The Best Video Editors

One of the powerful editing features offered by several premium-grade video editors is motion tracking. It not only boosts the overall video quality but also helps ensuring the object is engaged throughout the video. Many users fail to apply the motion tracking effect to the videos because they don’t use a reliable tool. The primary motive of this discussion is to provide you with the best-in-class motion tracker.

Not only will we tell you the name of the software, but we will also guide you through the procedure of doing this. Moreover, many of you don't know what motion tracking is. So, this article will also provide significant information about this.

## Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?

[Motion tracking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) helps you analyze the movements of different objects in your video content. This process involves various tasks that can be very helpful in video editing. For example, tracking and identifying the position of elements over time. The main purpose of motion tracking is to add graphics. Moreover, you can also add digital effects to the tracked objects.

You will need special software or video editing tools to perform this process. Here's how you can understand the motion tracking process with ease:

### Selection of Object

The editor can select the object that he wants to track in an effective manner. This object can be a person or any moving element that needs tracking. Moreover, it can also be a moving vehicle or a logo as well. Tracking these moving elements in the frame can allow the editor to improve the areas which have high contrast or distinct features.

### Tracking Points

Selecting the object allows the software to identify specific points in the frame. These points can have distinct features or a high contrast that may affect the video quality. With the help of **video motion tracking**, the editor can note down these areas and improve them to enhance the viewer experience.

### Data Mapping

Once the software tracks the movements, it can be very useful for the editor. This is because it calculates the changes in position and rotation of each point. Moreover, it also maps the tracked data into a visual representation for the coordinating system. Using this system, the movements of the objects can be recreated in a 3D space.

### Using Effects and Refinement

After obtaining the motion tracking data, the video editor can apply different effects on the object. These effects can include adding graphics and text to the scene. Moreover, it can also help in animation or compositing visual elements. To ensure the accurate alignment of the effects, the editor may need to use extra tracking techniques or manual adjustments.

## Part 2: Use Filmora's built-in VHS effects presets

For those unfamiliar, Filmora is more than just another video editing tool. It's a platform that has been applauded by beginners and professionals alike for its intuitive interface and powerful editing capabilities.

Among its vast array of features is a collection of built-in VHS effects presets, ensuring that users can achieve that much-coveted retro look without relying on external resources.

Here's a comprehensive guide:

### VHS Effects Editor

[VHS Effects Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Step 1: Navigate to the Filters Feature

Kickstart your editing journey by launching your desired project within Filmora. As you familiarize yourself with the interface, direct your attention to the left sidebar. You'll spot the **'Filters'** option among the various icons, symbolized by an artistic palette. This section houses a myriad of filters ready to elevate your video content. Give it a click to delve deeper into the world of Filmora filters.

### Step 2: Dive into the Retro Realm with VHS and Glitch Effects

Now that you're in the Filters section, the search bar at the top beckons. This feature ensures you can quickly access desired effects without sifting through the extensive collection. Begin by typing **"VHS"** or **"Glitch."**

As you type, the list below starts to populate with related effects. These aren't just your run-of-the-mill effects. Each has been crafted to bring a distinct vintage vibe, ensuring that every video has its unique touch of the past.

### Step 3: Instantly Apply the Chosen Effect with a Double Click

With the list of VHS effects now at your disposal, take a moment to preview each one by hovering over them. Found one that captures the essence of your vision?

It's time to apply the magic. Simply double-click on your chosen effect. Like that, your video segment, currently active on the timeline, gets transported back in time, imbued with all the charm of the VHS era.

For those who wish to refine the effect further, Filmora offers adjustment tools, allowing you to tweak the intensity, hue, and other parameters of the filter, ensuring your video looks just the way you envisioned.

## Part 3: Summary

Giving your videos a vintage VHS look has never been easier. With the availability of free resources online and built-in presets in editing software like Filmora, you're only a few clicks away from transporting your audience back to the 90s.

Whether for aesthetic or nostalgic reasons, the VHS effect is a fun way to spice up your videos. So, grab your camcorder (or smartphone) and start filming!

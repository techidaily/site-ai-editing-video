## What is After Effects?

[Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) is an application that can be used to create videos and animation. It is a powerful tool that allows you to create custom animations, including motion graphics, visual effects, and titles. Many professionals in the industry today use it to create visual effects and animations. This program can be used to create professional videos or advertisements for your business.

After Effects allows users to quickly create animations that have been created in other programs like Photoshop or Illustrator. It also allows users to edit videos to look better than they initially did. The program has many features, such as prebuilt templates, text tools, support for different file formats, and more. This program also has a lot of customization options and will allow you to create stunning visuals quickly and easily.

## How to split video clips in After Effects manually

### Import your video into the After Effects timeline

To split your video clip using after effects, the first step is to get the clip into the program. To do this, open the file menu in the top left corner of the After Effects workspace. Select **“** **Import**” from the options on the drop-down menu displayed. This will open up the file explorer for you to select the clip you would like to import into your project. Once you find your video file, click “**OK**” to add it to the project files. Alternatively, you can simply drag your clip from the file explorer and drop it into the Adobe After Effects workspace.

![import video into after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/split-clip-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Create a new composition

To go ahead with splitting your video clip, you will need to create a new composition. This can be done in two ways. The first is to drag the clip from the project browser to the new composition icon on the layer panel. This automatically creates a new composition. An alternate method is to right-click the video and select “**New Comp**” on the menu.

### Split the clip

Once you have your clip loaded into your timeline, you can go ahead to split it. You just have to move the timeline indicator to the exact position where you would like to split the video. Press the keyboard combination \[**CTRL + SHIFT + D**\] to split the video on a windows computer. For macOS users, you will have to use the combination \[**CMD + SHIFT + D**\]. Once this is done, the video clip is split right where the timeline marker is placed.

### **Step 1: Download Filmora**

Start by downloading and installing the Filmora software onto your desktop. This software provides a range of video editing tools, including video filters.

### **Step 2: Import your videos**

Open Filmora and import the videos you want to apply filters to. You can do this by clicking the "Import" button and selecting the video files from your computer.

### **Step 3: Add video filter effects in 2 ways**

Filmora offers two main ways to add video filters to your footage.

#### **1\. Add filters in the Effects panel**

First, you can add filters in the Effects panel. To do this, select the video clip you want to apply a filter to and click on the "Effects" tab in the upper-left corner.

Please browse through the available filters and click on one to apply it to your video. You can preview the effects in real-time and adjust the intensity or other settings.

#### **2\. Add luts and presets in the Color panel**

Second, add LUTs (Look-Up Tables) and presets in the Color panel. LUTs are predefined color grading settings that can give your videos a specific look or style. Select the video reel and click the "Color" tab to add a LUT or preset.

Then, click the "LUT" or "Presets" button and choose the desired effect from the available options. Like the Effects panel, you can adjust the settings to customize the product further.

Following these steps, you can easily apply video filters to your footage using Filmora on your desktop. Explore the various options and experiment with different effects to amplify the visual appeal of your videos.

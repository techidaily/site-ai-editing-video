## How to Make Custom Lower Thirds with Filmora

As a video creator, there are times when you need to use Lower Thirds. Although many lower-third presets are available, making unique and personalized ones can ensure your video stands out.

So, to empower your inner video creator, this article will show you how to make your own Lower Thirds in Filmora.

## Part 1: What is Lower Third

A Lower Third is a mix of motion graphic design and texts that are placed in the lower area of the screen. It provides additional information, such as a person's name or other relevant information, without distracting the audience from the main content.

Lower Thirds can be used in various settings, such as news broadcasts or interviews, to help provide viewers with additional context.

### (1) A simple line and texts

![a simple line and texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-1.gif)

##### Step1 Create a simple line

Go to the **Media library > Sample Media folder > choose a color sample**. For this tutorial, we will select the white color. Then, drag and drop this sample color onto the upper video track.

![create a simple line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-2.jpg)

Double-click the white sample clip to open the settings and scale it to 30%. Then, reposition the white bar to your desired place.

![double-click the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-3.gif)

##### Step2 Mask the white sample

Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the **Effect window > Utility > Image Mask**. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.

![mask the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-4.gif)

After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.

![double-click the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-5.jpg)

##### Step3 Add a text for your lower thirds

Go to **Titles > Plain Text > Basic 6** and drop it onto the second video track above the white line clip. Don't worry about the exact position yet. We can adjust it later.

![add a text for your lower thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-6.jpg)

Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.

![double-click on the text clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click **Advanced > Animation > Up Down 1** animation. Adjust the animation length by dragging the two brackets on the timeline on the right side. Click Ok.

![add animation to the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-8.jpg)

##### Step5 Add keyframes to the white line clip when entering

Double-click on the white line clip on the timeline to show the animation keyframe setting window. Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when entering](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-9.gif)

Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.

After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.

![move the play head to the left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-10.gif)

These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.

##### Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting

Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it's close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-11.gif)

You don't need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.

Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0\. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.

![move the texts out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-12.gif)

Playback the video and see how it looks.

### (2) A name card with a solid background

![a name card with a solid background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-13.gif)

Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here's how to do it:

##### Step1 Make the lower third background

Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.

![make the lower third background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-14.jpg)

Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.

![change the scale to 30%](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-15.gif)

##### Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background

Drag and drop the Image Mask onto the white sample clip on the timeline.

![create an image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-16.gif)

Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.

![double-click on the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-17.jpg)

##### Step3 Add some text

Once the background card is in place, go to Titles > Plain Text > ‘Basic 6' and drop it onto the third video track.

![go to titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-18.jpg)

Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.

![type in the texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-19.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click Advanced > Animation > Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.

![click advanced](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg)

Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.

![double-click on the background clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-21.jpg)

Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0\. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.

![move the play head again](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-22.gif)

To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.

![add two more keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif)

If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0\. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.

Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”

This step is all about experimenting and having fun. Tap on the filter icon, and voilà! You're greeted with various preset looks, waiting for your videos to don them. Glide through the options; VN has got it all from vintage vibes to futuristic glow. Found one that catches your eye?

Tap on it and watch your video transform instantly. Not sure about your pick? No worries; simply swipe left or right to preview other effects. Once you're satisfied, tap 'apply.'

**_Step 3: Adjust Details with Color Settings_**

Okay, young director, you've chosen your filter. But what if you want to tweak it just a bit? VN's got your back.

Once a filter is applied, you'll notice sliders or dials – these are your video filter editor tools. Play around with them! You can adjust the filter's intensity, making it as subtle or dramatic as you like. Tweak the brightness, contrast, and saturation until your video looks like you envisioned.

## Part 2: Download External Filter Installation Package

**_Step 1: Locate the My Filters Feature_**

The VN app is awesome, but can you add even more flair to your videos with custom filters? Yup! These aren't just your regular video presets – they're unique styles you can download and add to your VN arsenal.

To begin, tap on the “My Filters” section within the app. If you're wondering where this is, it's usually nestled beside the built-in filter options, represented by a '+' or 'Add' icon. This personal space is ready to be filled with your downloaded filter goodies.

**_Step 2: Import the Downloaded VN Filter APK_**

Here comes the cool part! To get new custom filters:

1. Visit the website or store where the VN filters are available for download. (**Hint:** Search for “vn filter download APK" or "vn iPhone filter download” based on your device.)
2. Once downloaded, head back to the VN app and click the **'Add'** or '+' icon in the **“My Filters”**
3. Navigate to your device's download folder or wherever the vn filter apk is saved.
4. Select the filter file (it should have a .apk or similar extension for Android users and a different format for iPhone users).
5. Tap on **'Import'** and wait for the magic to happen. Your brand-new filter will now be housed in **“My Filters”**!

**_Step 2: Save the Filter Preset and Use It Directly Next Time_**

After importing your snazzy new filter, the next step is super easy. Simply apply it to your video, and if you love how it looks, save it as a preset. This way, the next time you're editing, you can head straight to **"My Filters**," find your favorite custom filter and slap it onto your video without a hitch. Talk about convenience!

## Part 3: Best Alternatives

Though VN offers many fantastic filter options, it's always nice to have alternatives, right? Meet Filmora, another stellar video editing tool known for its expansive video filter collection.

Filmora is more than just an editor; it's a canvas for videographers. One of its most raved-about features is its extensive range of video filters. With Filmora, you can transport your audience from a sun-kissed beach to a moody, rain-soaked alley in just a tap. Whether you’re going for a documentary feel, a Hollywood movie vibe, or something out of a dream, Filmora's filters have covered you.

**Getting started is a breeze:**

1. Launch Filmora and import your video.
2. Head to the **“Effects”** tab and immerse yourself in the filter options.
3. Preview, select, and apply – it’s that simple!
4. Like VN, Filmora allows you to tweak the filter settings for that perfect look.

While Filmora is a great tool, the best fit depends on personal preferences and specific project needs. However, it's always good to have choices in your editing toolkit. Variety is, after all, the spice of life (and video editing)!

## Part 4: Summary

The beauty of video editing lies in the limitless possibilities it offers. With every video filter, editor tweak, and custom preset, you're not just editing – you're storytelling. And with tools like VN and Filmora at your fingertips, you have everything you need to tell your story your way.

Remember, whether you're a seasoned videographer or someone just starting, there's no 'right' or 'wrong' regarding creativity. Play around, experiment, and, most importantly, have fun with the process. In the vast universe of video editing, every filter is a star waiting to shine on your masterpiece.

Resize the video can be done in three ways:

### **1\. Zoom in and Zoom out**

First of all, select the videos in your timeline. You should stay in the middle of the frame to set it because it’s too wide. The timeline moves forward and backward. Let your video be 4k, go to the bottom-right corner and click on timeline format. Select timeline resolution, select ultra HD, or whatever you want from the drop-down list.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-1.png)

Go to the **inspector** from the up-right corner and select **Transform** under the **video** section. Here you can resize your image.

## How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

## Essential Things You Should Know About Color Grading in LumaFusion

Color grading is an essential post-production process that gives your footage's color scheme a distinctive appearance and character. This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.

With color grading, you can adjust your video's color balance, saturation, contrast, luminance, black level, etc. It helps to evoke the particular emotions or moods that you want your videos to exude.

These are the essential things to note about color grading in LumaFusion:

#### 1\. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?

In answering this question, it's essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it's wrong to use them interchangeably.

Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there's a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.

However, the aim of color grading isn't fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.

Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can't color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab's color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn't get the perfect results you want.

Fortunately, LumaFusion allows you to import and apply LUT (look-up tables). With LumaFusion LUTs, you can color grade your footage to your satisfaction.

#### 2\. How To Color Grade in LumaFusion

This is how to color grade your videos:

○ First, Color Correct

When attempting to color grade your footage, it's essential that you [color correct](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it first. Color correction ensures that your video doesn't remain flat or unexciting.

○ Create Your LUTs

LUT allows you to save specific color grades to use anytime you need them. This helps to save time by ensuring that you don't develop color spaces all over again when working on various footage. You can also download as many free LUTs as you like.

○ Bring In a LUT

After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It's that simple!

#### 3\. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?

## Part 1: What is the Adjustment Layer in After Effects?

The adjustment layer can save you time and energy from adding effects to multiple clips individually. It does not alter the composition of your video clip until you start applying the effects. Once you add the effect in the adjustment layer, it will replace the effect on all the layers under it.

You can add the adjustment layers in your timeline for creating visual effects such as film grain or color grading. Using the adjustment layer, you can produce transition effects by adding effects to shorter compositions. However, if you want to use the adjustment layer properly, you should select its position carefully in the layer’s stack.

Moreover, always keep in mind that anything placed under the adjustment layer will have a direct effect. In contrast, anything above the adjustment layer won’t get affected.

## Part 1 Tips For Creating An Impressive Slideshow Presentation

To create a unique and engaging slideshow presentation, we have shortlisted some tips that will surely work. Check them as below.

**●** **Have a theme**

Include relevant visuals like videos and images into your slideshow. Make sure that the files are in high resolution and clear and support the theme or the message you are trying to convey through the presentation.

**●** **Add effects, filters, overlays, and other elements**

Instead of adding the raw image and video footage, edit and customize them to make them more interesting and engaging. There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.

**●** **Use Templates**

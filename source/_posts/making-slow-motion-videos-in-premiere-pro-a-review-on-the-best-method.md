![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-2.png)

Click the **Tools** on the menu and select the **Effects and Filters.**

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-3.png)

After that, click on the **Video Effects** and under that select **Crop.** Doing this, will open the cropping editor.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-4.png)

You need to enter specific pixels on the **left**, **right, top** and **bottom**. This will depend on your preferences. If it is your first time and you don’t know the exact pixels then just input what you think would be enough.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-5.png)

After entering your preferred pixels, you can preview it. If you would like to adjust then just simply repeat entering the specific pixels.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-6.png)

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-8.png)

In the **Media** menu select the **Convert/Save**. You can drag and drop the cropped video to the **File** box.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-13.png)

Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.

Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.

While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.

What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.

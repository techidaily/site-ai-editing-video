## How to Turn On/Off Motion Blur in Minecraft?

Minecraft has been one of the most played games in the community. Known among hundreds of thousands of users, this game has been a prominent choice of many YouTube gamers. Streamers from all over the world are fond of playing this strategy game.

Although the game tentatively has a very basic graphic system, it has improved a lot with multiple features. Such is the addition of **Minecraft motion blur,** which has had mixed reviews throughout the community. For this article, we will be working on how to turn on/off the motion blur effect in Minecraft. The discussion covers everything related to the feature and its functionality.

![minecraft motion blur featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Motion Blur in Games?

Before you further discuss **Minecraft motion blur,** it might be vital for you to understand what the effect actually is. Motion blur effect has made a mark in video editing for presenting a realistic approach to videos.

For fast-moving objects, you can consider using the motion blur effect to display their swiftness. The use of the effect is consistently based on improving the user experience and showing objects in a realistic environment. The use of motion blur in games is based on providing a similar experience that was considered for videos.

As most games utilize stop-motion animation, it tends to lag at a lower frame rate. Motion blur enhances the gaming effects and smoothens them in a lower frame rate. This allows users to get a smooth game experience at a lower and adjustable frame rate. Motion blur in games has been added with the objective of smoothening the gameplay.

## Part 2: Does Minecraft Have Motion Blur?

Minecraft has provided the option of including the motion blur effect in its game. For a better visual experience, this effect has turned out to be quite beneficial. The existence of motion blur in Minecraft is equivalent to smoother gameplay, which is accomplished under a low frame rate. Rather than having screens with higher frame rates, you can get a low-end option.

All of this is essentially possible with the help of the motion blur effect. Even though Minecraft has a low-graphic display, it does not lag with motion blur. This is why the particular effect is recognized and acknowledged in the market. It has been discovered that Minecraft allows users to add motion blur from the graphic settings.

However, you must ensure that the device you are implementing has the tendency to control and manage the change and smoothness. Improper management of the motion blur under complex conditions will lead to multiple problems.

## Part 3: How to Get Motion Blur in Minecraft?

With an overview of the motion blur effect and what it is, we will now see how it can be obtained in the game. For the following steps, it can indeed work on the latest Minecraft versions, but it is precisely for versions 1.7.10 and 1.8.9.

Furthermore, we will focus on two different techniques to go along for getting motion blur in Minecraft. Let’s proceed to find out **how to get motion blur in Minecraft** by following these two methods:

### Method 1: Using PVP Clients

Step1 You can consider using any appropriate PVP client, such as [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) or [Badlion](https://www.badlion.net/), as they provide the appropriate mods to get motion blur in Minecraft. To start the process, you will have to install the PVP client on your computer from their official website.

![launch the lunar client](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-3.jpg)

Step2 Launch the client and proceed to select the version of Minecraft you are using and load the game. As you are within the game, move into the “Options” and look for “Video Settings.”

![access the video settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-4.jpg)

Step3 Look for the "Performance" options in the following settings and turn off "Fast Render" within the options. Once done, use the "Right Shift" button on your keyboard to access the Lunar Client menu. From there, you can set the intensity of motion blur from the available options.

![adjust the motion blur value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-5.jpg)

### Method 2: Use Forge

Step1 Another technique existing for getting motion blur within Minecraft is through [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/). While it is pretty common within the gaming community, it provides the option of using motion blur within the game. You must open their official website and download the version you wish to add to your game. In some cases, you might require installing Java on your computer.

![choose the forge version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-6.jpg)

Step2 Following this, open the Forge Installer to access the next screen. Select "Install Client" and continue to boot your Minecraft version where you wish to add motion blur.

![enable the install client option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-7.jpg)

Step3 You must access your Minecraft Launcher and look for "Forge" in the installations. Run the setup and quit the game. Download the motion blur mod to add to Minecraft. Look for the ".minecraft" folder in the "Local Disk (C:)" of your computer. Add the downloaded mod file to the "mods" folder.

![place motion blur in mods](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-8.jpg)

Step4 You must run Minecraft and type "/motionblur" in the chat box. You can set up the intensity of the motion blur from 1 to 10.

In some cases, you might feel the issue of disabling the effect within the game as it might be messing with other things. To prevent your gameplay from getting dismantled, you will have to know how to disable it. For that, we will look into a guide showing **how to turn off motion blur in Minecraft:**

Step1 If you have used "Shaders" to get motion blur within the Minecraft game, you will have to access them. For that, open the game and redirect to its "Settings." Proceed to the "Video Settings" and load into the "Shaders" menu.

![select the post-processing settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-11.jpg)

Step3 On the next screen, you will have to turn off the “Motion Blur” option and decrease the “Bloom Strength” to 0.1\. Click “Done” to save the settings.

**Step 4**: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the **Speed** menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.

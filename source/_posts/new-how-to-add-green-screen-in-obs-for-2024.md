## How to Add Green Screen in OBS

OBS Studio is a free and open-source app for screen-casting and live streaming. Written in C/C++ and built with Qt, OBS Studio provides real-time capture, scene composition, recording, encoding, and broadcasting via the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).It can stream Videos to any RTMP supporting destination including YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and Facebook.

You only need one green screen software – OBS. The reason why OBS is the most recommended for streaming is because once you have set it up properly, you can do literally anything you can think of with the software (either with or without added plug-ins).

## Chroma Key Settings in OBS

Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.

Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:

1. Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.
2. Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the [official website](https://obsproject.com/) and install the software. Open OBS and let the Auto-Configuration Wizard optimize the software’s settings based on your hardware.
3. Now you can add a video source.
4. Right-click on the video source you’ve created and select Filter.
5. Click the + button under the Effects Filters section and select Chroma Key.
6. Type in a name for this effect layer.
7. After you add a chroma key, OBS will automatically create and adjust the baseline settings for the filter. You can experiment with the sliders and settle when you are satisfied with the result.
8. Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.
9. If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.

Pro tip:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.

### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

##### Step 3

You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add **alpha matte in After Effects** or other types from here.

![use switches to add track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-4.jpg)

## Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps

Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using **After Effects mask tracking**, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use **Track Mask in After Effects**, you can follow these steps:

##### Step 1

Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.

![use pen tool to mark boundary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

##### Step 2

Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select "Track Mask." This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the "Method" option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn't moving much, you can choose a simple option such as "Position."

![set method for tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-6.jpg)

##### Step 3

Tap the "Analyze Forward" icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set "Mask Mode" from the timeline to "Subtract." This will remove the selected object from the clip.

![analyze and change mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-7.jpg)

##### Step 4

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

##### Step 3

You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add **alpha matte in After Effects** or other types from here.

## Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps

Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using **After Effects mask tracking**, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use **Track Mask in After Effects**, you can follow these steps:

##### Step 1

Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.

## 6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer

These days when you head on to social media, you can easily find 4-5 seconds video clips on the internet. However, many social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and other videos sharing platforms require you to make your video longer to meet the site’s minimum length requirements. So, for example, although Instagram’s minimum length is 3 seconds, you might want to find ways to engage your audience longer.

This article will describe the best ways to make a video longer. We’ll also offer a bonus tip on how you can edit your video to make it look better and attract more audience. On that note, let’s take a look.

**6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer**

There are many methods out there to make your video longer. This section will touch on the six best methods to make a video longer.

**Loop the Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-1.jpg)

One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.

Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.

**Slow Down the Video Speed**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg)

We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.

**Add an Intro and Outro**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg)

Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.

It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.

**Add Images to the Video**

This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.

**Boomerang Your Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg)

If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.

Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.

**Add More Content to Your Video Clip**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg)

Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.

Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-9.jpg)

Once you’re satisfied with your video clip, you can now proceed to save it. You can choose to save the video to your local folder or a storage device you’d prefer. Wondershare Filmora allows you to save in the original format or change the format to your preferred option. Filmora also allows you to change your video’s resolution and bit rate to your preference.

**Final Thoughts**

Social media platforms are great for gaining recognition and promoting your brand. However, there are times when you don’t meet the right video length, and you would like to make your video longer. With the six methods explained above, you can make your video as long as you want and also make your video more engaging. Additionally, you can use Wondershare Filmora to make your video more professional-looking. It offers you hundreds of effects and filters you can use to optimize your video.

**Meta Description:** If your video is short and you need to make it longer, this article gives you six methods to make a video longer and optimize them.

One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.

Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.

**Slow Down the Video Speed**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg)

We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.

**Add an Intro and Outro**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg)

Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.

It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.

**Add Images to the Video**

This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.

**Boomerang Your Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg)

If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.

Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.

**Add More Content to Your Video Clip**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg)

Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.

Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.

## Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?

For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

![ar in teaching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-1.jpg)

If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home/office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating **Augmented Reality in classrooms** and the education sector.

## Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education

### 01No Special Equipment Required

One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.

### 02Better Student Engagement

Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.

### 03Practical Learning

Another major advantage of **Augmented Reality in teaching** is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.

### 04Combined Learning

Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With **Augmented Reality in schools,** students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.

### 05Affordable

Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.

## Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples

Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, **AR classrooms** have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality in classrooms**.

### 01Exploring the Universe With Skyview

Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?

### 04Froggipedia

This is where things get interesting. Froggipedia is a great example of **Augmented Reality in teaching**. It’s basically a smartphone app that lets users explore the internal organs of a frog in a virtual environment. It means students would no longer have to get involved in the mess that dissecting an actual frog creates in the classroom and still get familiar with each organ easily.

![froggipedia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-4.jpg)

### 05Effective Marketing

Another example of **Augmented Reality in the teaching** world has nothing to do with learning, but the marketing aspect of the industry. With AR-based platforms, universities and colleges can market their brands among the target consumers and get a higher number of applications in return. They can launch digital publications and AR-powered videos to maximize engagement and achieve the desired results through their marketing campaigns.

![effecting marketing with ar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-5.jpg)

### 06Virtual Classrooms

The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of virtual classrooms as many schools still haven’t resumed physical classes to restrict the virus's spread. In VR classrooms, mixed reality - a combination of VR and AR - can help students stay engaged, even if they are sitting apart from each other. Virtual Classrooms will eliminate boredom from remote learning and keep the engagement level high for students.

![virtual classrooms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-6.jpg)

### 07Secure Training

As we mentioned earlier, AR integration makes training more effective and risk-free. For example, with Microsoft Holo-lens, medical students understand the inner anatomy of the human body and understand complex procedures without having to risk a patient’s life. Once they are confident and know about each organ, they can move towards the next procedure and gain expertise in the particular domain more effectively.

### 08Google Expeditions

For a student, exploring the world is a great way to familiarize himself with different cultures. But, it’s not always possible for young kids to go on trips alone. Well, not anymore! Thanks to virtual tour platforms like Google Expeditions, teachers can take their students on virtual trips to different corners of the world, be it Mount Everest Base Camp or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

![google expeditions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-7.jpg)

### 09Augmented Reality in Museums

The younger generation craves interactivity. They don’t have the time to read brochures in a Museum. That’s the reason why many Museums have started to launch AR-powered tech to keep the visitors engaged and let them learn various historical facts more precisely. For instance, in a nature-themed museum, visitors can experience digital animals and their position in history.

### 10Virtual Speech

Not particularly an Augmented Reality (AR) example, Virtual Speech is a combination of AR and VR that lets users virtually practice their public speaking skills without going on a real stage. This is a great tool to fight stage fear and speak with confidence in front of an actual crowd.

![virtual speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-8.jpg)

## Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?

For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

![ar in teaching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-1.jpg)

If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home/office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating **Augmented Reality in classrooms** and the education sector.

## Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education

### 01No Special Equipment Required

One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.

### 02Better Student Engagement

Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.

### 03Practical Learning

Another major advantage of **Augmented Reality in teaching** is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.

### 04Combined Learning

Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With **Augmented Reality in schools,** students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.

### 05Affordable

Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.

## Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples

Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, **AR classrooms** have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality in classrooms**.

### 01Exploring the Universe With Skyview

Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?

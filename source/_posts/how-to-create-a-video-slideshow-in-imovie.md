## 2 Solutions to Crop a Video Using After Effects

Cropping a video is part of the process of video edting. Not all video editing software can be obtained freely. There are some that you need to spend to get the professional output that you aim for.

This article can help you know how to crop video in After Effects and on the alternative by using Wondershare Filmora. I know that it may seem confusing to compare these two at first. But, I’ll provide an explanation to get the cropped video that you want.

## Method 1: Cropping a Video using After Effects

After Effects is a professional motion graphics tool that can create outputs that are beyond the limits of reality. Like the other Adobe tools, this comes with a subscription fee to be able to maximize this product. But, is the price worth the risk? The “ Adobe” brand is known for its quality applications and customer’s satisfaction.

Let’s start with using this tool. The situation is that you want to crop your video using Adobe After Effects but you don’t know how to start. Search for the application on your computer. Launch it, then click the **New Project**. If you have files from your storage then select the **New Composition Footage.**

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-1.jpg)

Check if the video is already in the interface. Find the **Magnifying** tab and zoom out the video into 50%. After that, click the **Grid** icon and **Proportional Grid**.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-2.jpg)

Click the **Square** icon, it is located beside the **Pencil** icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the **Proportiona**l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-3.jpg)

Already satisfied with the cropped video? Then, select **File,** **Export** and finally **Add to Render Queue.** Check on the **Render Settings** (located bottom of the interface) to ensure high quality output. Following that, hit the **Output To** part and decide the destination and folder where you want it to be.

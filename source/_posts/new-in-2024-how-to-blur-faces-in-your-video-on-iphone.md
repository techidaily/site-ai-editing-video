## An easier way to cut videos with Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an alternative video editor. Unlike VLC Media Player, Filmora gives you more options. It allows you to split, trim, edit, combine, and crop a video, among others. It also gives you room to add footnotes, a variety of transitions, lower thirds, among other features. You can as well resize your video and enhance its quality.

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

For macOS 10.14 or later

**To Cut/Trim Videos with Wondershare Filmora:**

1. **Drag and Drop the Video**

Assuming that you have already downloaded and installed Wondershare Filmora app, click to open. There are two ways through which you can locate your video.

One, you can opt to drag and drop the video from its location to the app’s timeline. Secondly, you can right click on the space at the top left then select the video to be edited from the dialogue box that will appear.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-5.png)

1. **Trimming the video**

After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.

To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-6.png)

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-7.png)

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

1. **Cutting the video**

Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.

With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-8.png)

After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.

1. **Save and/or Import your video**

The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.

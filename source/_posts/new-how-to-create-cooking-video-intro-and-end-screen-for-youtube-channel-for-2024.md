## Part 1 Why Create a Text Collage?

Adding a text to your collage is beneficial in ways more than one. The text brings versatility to your collage, and also helps in conveying the message along with the theme. Moreover, a little interesting text line along with animations added to your collage enhances its overall visual communication and looks.

## Part 2 When to Use Text Collage?

Though text can be added to all types of collages there are some specific occasions when the purpose of adding the text becomes more meaningful. For instance, adding text while creating a birthday collage, mood board collage, anniversary collage, scrapbook collage, holiday collage, or other similar ones helps in expressing the feelings, theme, and emotions in a better manner.

## Part 3 Factors to Be Considered While Creating a Text Collage

There are several text-adding ways and methods by which you can make your collage look interesting. Considering a few important ones will let you create an impressive collage in no time. Check out some useful tips and tricks to use text within the photo collage.

**●** Identify if you wish to add the text as the focal point or not. If you are using the text as the first striking thing in the collage then ensure that it is eye-catchy and interesting.

**●** Keep a good balance between the text and the images so that it does not look weird.

**●** The color and the font of the text are among the most important factors to be considered. Make sure that both the text color as well as the font match and blend well with the theme and the images in the collage.

**●** Keeping the background of the text simple, less detailed, and also clutter-free is important so that the text content comes out nicely.

**●** Make sure only to add a few words or lines in your collage to make it look sophisticated. It's majorly a photo collage with a dash of the text so keep it that way only and not vice-versa.

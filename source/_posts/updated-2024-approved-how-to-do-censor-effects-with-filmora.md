## How to Do Censor Effects with Filmora

There are many aspects to consider when it comes to publishing a video. Safety and privacy aspects are some of them. If you're looking to blur out a bystander or cut out profanities from your video with Filmora, this is the right article for you.

## Part 1\. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora

Filmora's powerful video editing menu includes easy tweaking on audio. You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.

Step1 Create a new project and import the video to Filmora.

![import the video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 Separate the audio component from the video by right-clicking on the video and selecting the Detach Audio option. You can now edit each of them individually.

![detach the audio component](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Mark the part to place the start of the beep using the playhead and click the Split icon on the editor’s toolbar.

## Part 2\. How to add mosaic to video with Filmora

Whether you want to hide a passerby's face or your own, or even other types of objects, Wondershare Filmora is ready to take on the task.

Without further ado, let's see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.

### a. Preparation

You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.

Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.

Take the first main video and don't forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.

Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.

### b. Steps to add the shadow effect to your videos using Masking

Step 1: Place the main clip on the timeline and find the start of the segment that you want to use. Press M on the keyboard to set a marker.

![placing a marker on the main clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-2.jpg)

Step 2: Place the shadow clip on top of the main clip on the timeline. Trim and adjust until the shadow clip ends right at the marker of the main clip.

Step 3: Move the play head to the start of the shadow clip. Trim the main clip right on that mark so both clips have the same start by clicking the scissor icon and deleting the unused part.

![sync the main and shadow clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-4.gif)

Step 4: Double-click the shadow clip. Open**Settings > Mask Section > Rectangle** to apply the mask. Adjust the blur strength to smooth out the edge.

Step 5: Play the result to see if there's any part you need to block out. When you find them, repeat steps 1 to 4 but with the background clip. Try to conceal all things you need to hide using the masks. Make sure that you get the timings right.

![block unwanted objects off the final clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-6.gif)

Step6 Trim the length of the masking clips to match the main clip by sliding the play head and clicking the Split button.

Adjust the audio and preview the effect before you save the result. You can also add extra features like slow motion for maximum effect.

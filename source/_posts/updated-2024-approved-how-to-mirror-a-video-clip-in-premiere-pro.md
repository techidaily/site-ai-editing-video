## How To Mirror a Video Clip in Premiere Pro

Video editing is a crucial part of filmmaking, and it can make or break the outcome of a project. Adobe Premiere Pro is a widely used video editing software that provides a vast range of tools for professional video editing. One of the features that Premiere Pro offers is the ability to mirror video clips, which can add an interesting visual element to your footage.

In this article, we will look at how to mirror a video clip in Premiere Pro in a few simple steps. Whether you're a seasoned video editor or just starting, this guide will help you achieve the desired effect in your videos. From basic mirroring to advanced techniques, we will cover everything you need to know to create a symmetrical and visually appealing look in your projects.

## What Is To "Mirror" a Video?

Mirroring a video in Adobe Premiere Pro refers to reflecting the footage along either the horizontal or vertical axis. This results in the composition being flipped and reversed, creating a reflection-like effect. Flipping a video is distinct from rotating it, as the orientation of the elements is changed, but their position remains the same.

Flipping can serve both creative and practical purposes. On the one hand, it can add a unique and visually interesting element to a project, creating a form of self-reflection or self-analysis. On the other hand, flipping can also be used to correct videos accidentally captured upside down. For example, flipping a video recorded with a selfie camera along the horizontal axis will correctly display the right side up.

It is important to note the distinction between flipping and rotating a video. A flipped video will look like a mirror image, whereas a video rotated 180 degrees will not. By understanding the differences between these techniques, you can effectively use mirroring to achieve the desired result in your projects.

## Track Mattes: The Ultimate Guide For After Effects

Are you wondering what **Track Mattes** is? In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.

For After Effects editors, **Track Mattes** can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.

In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about **Track Mattes**. We'll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.

1. [Alpha Matte](#part4-1)
2. [Alpha Inverted Matte](#part4-2)
3. [Luma Matte](#part4-3)
4. [Luma Inverted Matte](#part4-4)
5. [Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel](#part4-5)

## Part 1\. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?

A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a "hole" in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.

You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.

Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.

Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.

## Part 2\. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte

In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.

Here're some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:

1. A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.
2. A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.

## Part 3\. Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects

Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the **Transfer Control Pane** button on the bottom-left of the timeline.

![track matte in the timeline window of the after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/track-matter-in-the-timeline-window-of-the-after-effects.png)

If you are still unable to find the Track Matte option, press the **F1 key** or do the following steps in sequence:

1. Right-click on the area above your layers and select **"Columns."**
2. Scroll down and click the **"Modes"** option to enable it.

![finding the track matte option in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/finding-the-track-matte-option-in-after-effects.png)

1. **Track Matte mode, Preserve Underlying Transparency,** and **Blending Modes** will be available now.

Under Track Matte's drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma. We'll discuss these options in detail in the next section.

## Part 4\. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects

After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:

**Alpha:** This Track Matte type uses the layer's Alpha channel to determine the layer's opacity.

**Luma:** This Track Matte type uses the top layer's brightness to mask the bottom layer.

![the four track matte options in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png)

Let's find out the functions of each option one by one:

### Alpha Matte

Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.

### Alpha Inverted Matte

The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.

### Luma Matte

Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.

### Luma Inverted Matte

Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.

### Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel

When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.

Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.

![alpha channel in track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/alpha-channel-in-track-matte.png)

On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.

## How to DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The 90s generation is familiar with Video Home System video. Today, Moviemakers use VHS static overlay to give their videos an antique and vintage look.

The VHS glitch overlay has become increasingly popular as it changes the video's theme, tone, and whole look. Let's see how we can add DIY VHS overlay in after effects-

## Part 1：Step by Step DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The retro "VHS Look" has become relatively trendy in recent years. The memories associated with the popular VHS trend has helped the trend make a comeback. Creating this effect in After Effects may seem to be a complicated process if you have not tried it before. But we have made it easier for you to add VHS overlay in Adobe After Effects. Follow the steps to add it in after effects-

Before you begin, download and install VHS preset if you haven't already. Remember that VHS preset only works with After Effects CC 2018 and up. So, make sure you have the recent version of After Effects or the one not older than the 2018 version.

Step 1: To create a VHS look on your video, drop any video of your choice into the project panel and give it a name, let's say, "VCR static overlay". Set the width and height to 1920 and 1080 px, respectively.

![changing composition settings on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-composition-settings-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 2: Right-click on your video and select New Comp from Selection. Drag your video to a new composition and then go to Lumetri Color < Basic Correction. Add some contrast. You can set it to 50 or any other number of your choice. Then bring the white level down to -55.

![getting lumetri color effect to get vhs look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-lumetri-color-effect-to-get-vhs-look.jpg)

Then open the Creative tab. Increase the faded film to 40\. Set sharpening to -70\. Bring vibrance to -30.

Note: Here, I changed the number to get the effect I wanted. You can change the numbers and set the values as per your requirements.

Now, click on the Curves option. Drag down the white curve and then align it with the original curve. Move the green curve up a bit and bring down the blue curve. Then comes the Vignette tab. Open it and set the number to -1.

![changing white green and blue curves on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-white-green-and-blue-curve-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 3: Now, we will give our video a subtle RGB spit appearance. For that, we need to use the Channel Blur effect twice. First, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set red blurriness to 20\. Turn on the repeat edge pixels. Then change the Blur Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to vertical.

![giving rgb split appearance to video with channel blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/giving-rgb-split-appearance-to-video-with-channel-blur.jpg)

Step 4: Again, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set blue blurriness to 30\. Repeat the process of checking the repeat edge pixels box. Change the Blue Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to horizontal.

Step 5: Next comes giving the video artificial sharpening look using Unsharp Mask. So, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Unsharp Mask. Under the Unmask Mask menu, set the amount to 100 and the radius to 10.

![using unsharp mask to give you video sharpening look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-unsharp-mask-to-give-your-video-sharpening-look.jpg)

Step 6: To add a font to your video, simply search VHS font on Google. Look for the one you want to use in your video and download it. To give your video that authentic VHS-style look, we suggest downloading free VCR OSD Mono font and installing the font on your system.

Step 7: Go to Layer < New < Solid and choose any color. We chose white. Now, under Effects & Presets, search for a number. Drag it to the white solid. Choose the font VCR OSD Mono. You can change the number to time or date. You can also add time manually. Select the text tool, go to the source text, hold alt, and click on the stopwatch. Write "timeToCurrentFormat() and time will be displayed on the video. Let us say we want to see the date on the video instead of time. So, change the time to date. Drag the date to the bottom right of the video to give it the look of an old VHS tape.

If you are a beginner and want a simple VHS effect, you can follow these easy steps and create the VHS video that will transport you back to the 90s.

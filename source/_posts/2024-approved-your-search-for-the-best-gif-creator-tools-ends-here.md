## Camtasia Video Editor Review

If you are planning to record your screen and create a tutorial video, you will need a screen recording application. After capturing your video, you need to edit your videos so that you can remove unnecessary parts and add texts and titles wherever necessary. You will need a video editor with screen recorder, and Camtasia video editor is a suitable choice.

Camtasia lets you capture your gameplay as well as create software demo videos. You can choose from video templates and themes to create professional-quality videos as per your requirements. You can add transitions, effects, and annotations to make the videos attractive and engaging. But is Camtasia editor really the best one or is there a better alternative available? Find out from our Camtasia review.

## Part 1\. How to Download and Install Camtasia?

TechSmith Camtasia is compatible with both Windows 10 or above and Mac 10.14 or above. Camtasia is not a lightweight video editor as it demands 8GB of RAM. As far as the processor goes, it requires at least a 6th Gen Core i3 processor or M1 Apple processor. Therefore, if you have a low-end computer, you may experience lag and crash.

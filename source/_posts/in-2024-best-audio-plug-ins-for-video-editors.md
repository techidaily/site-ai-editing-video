## Best Audio Plug-Ins For Video Editors

When it comes to improving the sound of the audio in your video editing projects, you have a variety of options to choose from when approaching the editing. Most plugins that we will cover today will be helpful for many different effects instead of only one particular one.

Let's get started!

## 1\. Synchro Arts Revoice Pro

Let's talk about Revoice Pro 4\. This is an awesome plugin for when you are finishing complex editing projects when you work with dialogues and need to synchronize other lines to fit the shot. Revoice Pro 4 combines timing and pitch alignment technology, together with as a pair of cutting-edge tuning tools and a natural-sounding vocal doubler for people working on the narrator voice.

![synchro arts revoice pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/synchro-arts-revoice-pro.jpg)

For the video editors working in audio post-production, the stand out new feature added to Revoice Pro is Smart Align combined with a fast workflow, meaning that you don't need to leave Pro Tools to synchronize ADR to the location audio. Although Version 4.3 presented an ARA version of the Revoice Pro link plug-in for Logic Pro users, so providing immediate transfers back and forth between Logic Pro or higher Synchro Arts haven't counted out Pro Tools users by preparing a new set of AudioSuite plugins.

The APT procedures, used to align the pitch and timing of multiple vocal tracks, now includes SmartAlign. When this is turned on, it can align audio with significant gaps in the guide or even dub the audio. This feature enables you to align much longer performances, which in the past had to be divided into smaller sections.

 As Revoice Pro has improved over the years, the latest version is giving you the ultimate workflow it should always have had in the past. Synchro Arts have been able to create the perfect workflow with an AudioSuite plugin, that runs Revoice Pro in the background without having to have to switch back between Revoice Pro and Pro Tools. Select your audio and the desiredRevoice Pro preset, process the audio in Revoice Pro and place it directly into the timeline without having to leave Pro Tools.

Smart Align and the Quick APT AudioSuite plugin made this fairly easy, yet powerful, workflow. Synchro Arts has also been able to fix the tasks of how to handle gaps. Before V4.3, you had to make sure there weren't any unexpected empty spots, or it was not able to work out what to do. Using Smart Align, it handles the gaps without any problems.

Whether you need to tighten any kind of pitch or timings on a vocal recording, Revoice Pro is the one for you. Revoice Pro is great for working with vocal recordings, but it's perfectly suitable for instruments like guitars and strings too.

Synchro Arts Revoice Pro is available for $599.

## 2\. Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista

This is a very interesting plugin. Colorista tries to cancel out the need for a separate color-specific program by increasing more color correction options. This plugin allows you to have more color control with tools for tints, temperatures, vignetting, RGB curving, and so forth. Colorista contains a three-way color function and support for LOG clips and LUT filters. Colorista is not a stand-alone program. It's designed to integrate into existing software and offer better functionality. Plugins let you design something that wasn't there originally. You don't have to load a certain project to activate them.

![red giant magic bullet colorista](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/red-giant-magic-bullet-colorista.jpg)

For years, Red Giant has been one of the biggest developers of plugins designed for video editing software. Among the other ones is the Magic bullet suite, which contains quite some plugins to solve video noise problems and do some color grading. We believe the versatility of Red Giant allow content creators and movie producers to let their ideas come to life, create dynamic art and create better content overall.

Even though Red Giant's Magic Bullet Suite is a plugin suite created for Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, it also works with other video editing software such as VEGAS Pro. The suite focuses on color correction and color grading improvements. VEGAS Pro is my software of choice, but one aspect of Premiere that I've always thought inadequate were the color correction tools. Looks is completely customizable, and a "preset" can be built up from zero. The Colorista suite comes with a lot of other plugins that have crucial roles in the color grading aspect of video editing. Denoiser II is ideal for clearing up scratchy footage.

Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista is available for $199.

## 3\. Boris FX Continuum 2022

The thriving film industry's filmmakers choose Boris FX Continuum. This package contains super strong, timesaving plugins for a smoother workflow with seventeen effects and quick fix plug-in options. Continuum Includes over 200 effects and more than 3500 presets. Each pair will be suitable for each project. Continuum 2022 is the latest biggest release of the post-production plugin collection. The release includes 6 transitions, 4 effects and nearly 100 professionally developed templates. It's definitely worth checking it out!

![boris fx continuum 2022](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/boris-fx-continuum-2022.jpg)

This 2022 release brings 50+ film and TV-inspired color grades to assist you in transforming the clips into amazing looks.

## How to Zoom Picture in Picture [Easy Solution]

Zoom is one of the greatest options on the market for video conferencing. It doesn't matter whether you use it at home or in an office environment; it will quickly link the team members. One of the most popular video conferencing programs is Zoom. When in-person meetings aren't feasible, it enables you to communicate electronically with employees, and it's been a major popularity for social occasions as well. In case you're not acquainted, picture-in-picture mode enables you to watch videos from one app while using your PC normally. The movie will keep playing in a tiny thumbnail window so that two applications may work simultaneously on your smartphone.

You may create virtual audio and video conferences, webinars, live chats, screen sharing, and other collaboration tools with Zoom, a cloud-based video communications solution. Zoom's most recent iPhone apps let you dismiss a Zoom Meeting while keeping the Zoom video call open in a picture-in-picture mode. To join a Zoom conference, you don't need an account, and because the software works with Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android devices, nearly anybody can use it. Since using Zoom's picture-in-picture mode is the same as using it with other applications, you shouldn't have any trouble if you often use PiP mode. Here are the top 4 methods you can refer to picture in picture in Zoom.

## Method 1: Swap Shared Screen with Video

You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Before leaving the meeting if you're not giving a presentation or speaking, you should definitely mute Zoom on your iPhone to prevent noises from your typing or other activities from entering the conversation. Additionally, keep in mind to switch off the camera if you're engaged in something distracting, at least for the duration of your activity. To reopen the Zoom Meeting and go back to the Zoom app, touch the Picture-in-Picture mode pane. Here are some actions to keep in mind:

### Steps to Swap Shared Screen for Zoom Picture in Picture

Step1Launch or enter a Zoom meeting. Keep the video on your main screen at all times, closing the chat and participant list as necessary.

Step2Tap the Home button or swipe up from the bottom of the screen.

![how to zoom picture in picture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/swap-shared-screen-zoom.jpg)

Step3Picture-in-picture mode should be activated automatically throughout the meeting.

## Method 2: Use Ecamm Live

Live streaming is a fantastic way to provide original content and stand out from the crowd. To prevent any operational difficulties, a more sophisticated virtual camera is absolutely necessary. You now have magical abilities thanks to Ecamm virtual cam, including the ability to add text, animations, observe a live stream, post viewer comments, play music, share your screen, use sound effects, and many more. It offers the Ecamm live virtual camera zoom function for video conferences so you may improve your Zoom discussions by sending output to other PC programs. You could see a quality difference between what you view in Ecamm Live and what your Zoom visitors see while utilizing virtual camera with Zoom. The quality of a Zoom video stream cannot be improved using Ecamm Live. Simply broadcast the Zoom app using Ecamm Live's Screen Share mode to utilize Ecamm Live for picture-in-picture virtual presentations on Zoom.

### Steps to Use Ecamm Live for Zoom Picture in Picture

##### Step1Download the Ecamm Application

Install Ecamm Live on your computer, then choose the center button in the source switcher at the top of the main window to enter Screen Share mode.

## Method 3: Use Filmora as A Switcher

Four HDMI inputs, or four cameras that can produce an HDMI video stream, may be switched between live. This device integrates Zoom meetings fast and makes it incredibly simple to set up your audio, a sometimes-forgotten aspect of video broadcasting. This sophisticated video switcher promises to offer broadcast-quality multi-camera footage with ease and is targeted at gamers, streamers, and online reviewers. It connects to a computer via a USB-C to USB-A connection. The video feed may then be sent to distant colleagues via a number of well-liked videos streaming services, including Zoom.

## Conclusion

When you are doing a Zoom Meeting and share your screen, only to discover that what the other attendees see is a split screen with your material and the other Attendee cams, it is highly annoying. You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail's size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Someone must be sharing information in the Zoom conference for the Picture in Picture, or "Split Screen" option, to be active. We've listed the top techniques for doing it effectively above. To do this work without difficulty, use them as your guide.

## Magic Effects Video Making [How To]

Magic inspires and fascinates everyone. Editors often rely on it to create suspense and attraction in their films. With an all-in-one video editor, Filmora, you can get creative and use ample stupefying effects to amuse your viewers. Before delving into the details of step-by-step guides of some magic effects, let's examine these effects.

## Part 1\. What Are Magic Effects?

In terms of video editing, visual effects which imply the presence of supernatural forces (the ones having power over natural forces) are called magic effects. They could belong to any of the effects of charm, i.e., sudden appearance, vanishing, transposition, transformation, etc. For example, in Harry Potter's classic scene, everyone waves a lit magic wand. To make this kinetic effect ourselves at home, read on.

![a man appearing to levitate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-1.gif)

## Part 2\. How to Create a Magic Effect with Filmora

![importing clips to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-3.png)

##### Step3 Add Your Photos and Videos to the Timeline

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline. When you have many videos and photos imported into the timeline, you can add them simultaneously.

Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. To add an item to your timeline, follow the steps mentioned.

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want to add to the timeline.
* Keep holding the right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-4.png)

##### Step4 Adding the Magic Imitating Effect

After these initial setups, you must add the effects from filmstock to our clips. These are pre-made presets of different clipart and graphics, executing unique movements and effects. For their introduction in the video, read along with the following procedure:

* After dragging and dropping the clip onto the first track on the timeline, go to the stickers tab on the top left ribbon, click it, and scroll down to the filmstock dropdown.

![finding the magic effects from filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-5.png)

* From there, open the Bling Bling Effect Pack and choose the bling light effect of your liking. Then, drag and drop that effect onto the second video track on the timeline.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-6.png)

* Adjust the element's scale according to your required size from the editing menu after double-clicking the element.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-7.png)

* Move the **playhead** to locate the brightest moment of the element. Now, right-click and select **Add Freeze Frame.** It will freeze the element at that exact frame

![adding freeze frame to the element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-8.png)

* Find the spot on the base clip's timeline where the corresponding LED used while shooting turns on. Then, bring the element to the second track and adjust its position.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** ensure the element's freeze frame starts when the anticipated magic wand light is glowing.

![adjusting the start of effect on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-9.png)

* Adjust the duration to match the end of the two clips on the timeline.

![bringing the ends of the two frames together](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-10.png)

##### Step5 Adding Keyframe Movement to the Element

It is time to add some keyframes. Once you have successfully added the effect element onto your editing workspace, you have to make it do the magic. Attaching the magic effect bling to the base (background) video is like painting your canvas for the magic to occur. It is a crucial step for bringing out those Harry Potter-like magical feats. Continue scrolling for step-by-step instructions.

* Double-click the effect element and open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-11.png)

* In the basic tab, as visible above, **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then **adjust** the element's position at the wand's tip on the preview window.

![positioning the element at the desired location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-12.png)

##### Step6 Detailing the Effect Through Keyframing

This part of the procedure is iterative. You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.

* Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand's tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element's position onto the wand's tip.

![eeadjusting the elements position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-13.png)

Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.

Finally, it is time to look at the results. Witness how you have curated a magical masterpiece.

![wondershare filmora interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-2.png)

##### Step2 Import Your Photos and Videos

When you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.

* Click in the center of the import window upon the import icon.
* After clicking, Wondershare Filmora will automatically direct you to your PC library.
* **Browse** to where your target Clips or Images are stored.
* Select all the objects you want to import.
* Click on **Open,** and you will have imported files.

![importing clips to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-3.png)

##### Step3 Add Your Photos and Videos to the Timeline

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline. When you have many videos and photos imported into the timeline, you can add them simultaneously.

Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. To add an item to your timeline, follow the steps mentioned.

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want to add to the timeline.
* Keep holding the right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-4.png)

##### Step4 Adding the Magic Imitating Effect

After these initial setups, you must add the effects from filmstock to our clips. These are pre-made presets of different clipart and graphics, executing unique movements and effects. For their introduction in the video, read along with the following procedure:

* After dragging and dropping the clip onto the first track on the timeline, go to the stickers tab on the top left ribbon, click it, and scroll down to the filmstock dropdown.

![finding the magic effects from filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-5.png)

* From there, open the Bling Bling Effect Pack and choose the bling light effect of your liking. Then, drag and drop that effect onto the second video track on the timeline.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-6.png)

* Adjust the element's scale according to your required size from the editing menu after double-clicking the element.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-7.png)

* Move the **playhead** to locate the brightest moment of the element. Now, right-click and select **Add Freeze Frame.** It will freeze the element at that exact frame

![adding freeze frame to the element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-8.png)

* Find the spot on the base clip's timeline where the corresponding LED used while shooting turns on. Then, bring the element to the second track and adjust its position.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** ensure the element's freeze frame starts when the anticipated magic wand light is glowing.

![adjusting the start of effect on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-9.png)

* Adjust the duration to match the end of the two clips on the timeline.

![bringing the ends of the two frames together](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-10.png)

##### Step5 Adding Keyframe Movement to the Element

It is time to add some keyframes. Once you have successfully added the effect element onto your editing workspace, you have to make it do the magic. Attaching the magic effect bling to the base (background) video is like painting your canvas for the magic to occur. It is a crucial step for bringing out those Harry Potter-like magical feats. Continue scrolling for step-by-step instructions.

* Double-click the effect element and open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-11.png)

* In the basic tab, as visible above, **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then **adjust** the element's position at the wand's tip on the preview window.

![positioning the element at the desired location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-12.png)

##### Step6 Detailing the Effect Through Keyframing

This part of the procedure is iterative. You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.

* Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand's tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element's position onto the wand's tip.

![eeadjusting the elements position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-13.png)

Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.

Finally, it is time to look at the results. Witness how you have curated a magical masterpiece.

## Easy Guide to Overlay Videos in Premiere Pro

In order to make it simple to combine the shot's components into a sequence, video overlays are pieces of film that are often recorded in a dark studio. Using image overlays on a video production is fairly frequent. However, adding pictures to every video you export might be tiresome and time-consuming if you have several films to send. For instance, an overlay video in Premiere Pro might be preferred by you rather than a manual addition of the overlay media.

There is a quick and easy method to know how to overlay a video on a video in Premiere Pro and we’ve got it covered. However, depending on the kind of element, there may be some color blending that affects the components themselves. Overlays may be filmed on either a green screen or a blue screen. Snow components photographed against a green screen may have a green hue shift, necessitating further color grading before the footage might be used.

## Part 1\. How to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro

Videos sometimes need a splash of color to elevate them. With the built-in color effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, you can apply overlays to any video, whether you want to add a little drama to a clip or a splash of color to a social media post. We'll demonstrate how to overlay videos in this article. To liven up your intros, make your outros stand out, and spruce up your summer social media posts, add a gradient video overlay effect. Adobe Premiere Pro and gorgeous video clips are all you need.

**Steps to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro**

##### Step1Activate Premiere Pro

To build a new sequence, start a new project in Premiere, import your footage, then drag your clip onto the timeline. The clip's parameters will be reflected in the sequence.

![activitate premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/activitate-premiere-pro.jpg)

##### Step2Select Overlay Effect

Secondly, choose the Effects workspace (located near the top of your window). This will guarantee that the tools we need are accessible. Alternately, you may go to Window > Workspaces > Effects.

![select overlay effects pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-overlay-effects-pr.jpg)

##### Step3Create a layer of adjustments

Go to File > New > Adjustment Layer to begin. Make sure your Project panel is chosen if the option is not accessible. Your clip and sequence will show up in your Project panel with the adjustment layer. Add the timeline with the adjustment layer selected.

![create a layer adjustment pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-layer-adjustment-pr.jpg)

##### Step4Create the Video Overlay

Transitions, generators, audio effects, and video effects are all included under the Effects panel. We'll begin by selecting the 4-Color Gradient from the "Generate" folder, which contains generators for patterns and gradients, to produce the video overlay effect. Right-click on the adjustment layer in the timeline and drag the appropriate effect there.

![create the video overlay pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-the-video-overlay-pr.jpg)

##### Step5Change the Effect Control

In the Effect Controls panel, you may manage and adjust effects. You may change the default effect settings for each element in your timeline, such as size and opacity, under the Effect Controls panel along with any additional effects you've added. To access an item's effect controls, click on it in the timeline.

![change effects control pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/change-effects-control-pr.jpg)

By selecting the ‘Show all properties’ next to the adjustment layer in your timeline, you can get a before-and-after comparison. Increase the value by selecting "blend with original." To change the effect's strength, move this up and down.

##### Step6Save the Project

Try switching the linear mode to radial. You can make a color transition for circles by doing this. You will be able to highlight various things with color after this transition. The circle's starting point may be animated to follow a certain item in the scene.

![save the project pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/save-the-project-pr.jpg)

To the right of the Presets drop-down menu, choose the Auto Save button. Check the Save Effects Settings box when the Choose a Name dialog box appears. Future exports made with this preset will automatically take into account any Image Overlay settings you've configured.

Here’s how you can edit the TXT file without using any external software and online tools:

1. If you’re using a Windows computer, then you can open your TXT document in Microsoft Notepad. For a Mac computer, you can use TextEdit. On the very first line of the document, type a number to identify the subtitle's section. Each section indicates an individual subtitle, which could be a sound or one sentence from a dialogue.
2. The next line would be the timestamp of the subtitle. _Timestamp_ follows this formatting: _hours: minutes: seconds, milliseconds._
3. In the next line, write your caption.
4. Now add double space between the next section and write it as you did for the previous section.

Now that you’ve formatted the TXT file to use it as a subtitle file, let’s save it .SRT format. Here’s how to save your file as .SRT:

1\. Go to the File tab and select Save as.

![save as srt file with notepad](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-txt-to-srt-14.jpg)

2\. Now, save the document with a .\*\*SRT\*\* extension.

![edit the save as type option to save txt to srt file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-txt-to-srt-15.jpg)

![images-common](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** the advantage of converting TXT file to SRT manually is that it does not require tools and is free, but it does have disadvantages. The bad site is that it is troublesome, time-consuming, and easy to get format mistakes. That is why we recommend professional converting tools most for TXT to SRT conversion.

Now, you can use this file as the subtitle file while watching the video on any video playback software such as the VLC media player.

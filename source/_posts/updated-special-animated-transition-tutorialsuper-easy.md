## 2 Ways to Fade in Text in Premiere Pro

Every video is unappealing until you edit the video properly. Editing videos not only means trimming out unnecessary parts but also adding effects and animations. There are certain effects and transitions that are commonly used in most videos. Fade in effect is widely used in texts, objects, as well as clips. Fade in effect is very eye-soothing that does not distract the audience from the overall video content.

Fade in effect is available in all video editors. Among video editors, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the best professional video editors. However, the learning curve of Premiere Pro is steep and hence, you have to know the exact steps to add fade in text Premiere Pro. We will illustrate how to apply fade in text effect Pro as well as add fade in and fade out transition effects in Premiere Pro. We will also state an alternative way to fade in texts in your videos.

## Part 1\. Fade in text in Premiere Pro with Opacity option

If you have added any text or any graphical object in your video on Premiere Pro, you can apply fade in effect to your text and object easily. When you add fade in effect to your text or object, they slowly appear on the screen which is very soothing to watch instead of sudden and abrupt appearance. Here are the steps on how to fade text in Premiere Pro.

Step1 You must have your video clip as well as text clip on the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Make sure that you add text from Essential Graphics panel. Select the text clip from the Timeline to proceed.

Step2 Go to Effect Controls and click on Text option to expand it. Click on Opacity option from the dropdown menu.

![make opacity to 100 pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-opacity-to-100-pr.jpg)

Step5 Play the video to watch the fade in effect on your selected text. You can move the keyframes to speed up or slow down fade in effect.

## Part 2\. Make fade in or out with transition effects

If you have multiple video clips or scenes, you should add fade in and fade out transition effects so that the transition from one clip to another or one scene to another is smooth. The fade in or fade out effect for video clips look similar to fade text Premiere Pro. In fact, you can use the steps of how to fade in text in Premiere Pro to get the job done. But there is an easier way available with Video Transitions option. Here are the steps on how to apply fade in or out effect on your video clips in Premiere Pro.

Step1 You should have multiple video clips added to Timeline. Select the video clip to which you want to apply Fade in effect.

Effective use of Fades is a crucial skill in your video editing repertoire since it is subtle to the point of practically being undetectable. A video transition called a "fade to black" causes a scene or clip to gradually conclude with a black backdrop.

The stage therefore went completely black while the team behind hurriedly changed into new clothing and stage items for the following action.  

Those that seem to take place close together chronologically are edited together, while scenes that occur at separate periods or locales are faded out. These are recognizable features of the film. They alert us to the fact that the tale is moving to a later time or place, either thematically, chronologically, or geographically. In a practical sense, this is the time when the cast and crew switch out the set and clothes. But the fade-to-black marks the end of the scene in a symbolic and narrative sense.

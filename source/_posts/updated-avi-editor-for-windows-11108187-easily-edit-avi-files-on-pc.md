## Step by Step to Rotate Videos in Windows Media Player

Video Editing and the emotion the final product evokes is dependent on many aspects, be it the source clips, the cuts introduced or the way of presentation. But to get to the end, there are several steps involved in the production process, and not every instance of it is perfect. But we all know, editing does often help iron out any kinks, with its ability to solve basic problems, like footage that is askew, or upside down. Thus with the steps listed in this article we will help you understand how you can rotate videos to ensure your edited project looks as intended.

This particular article considers the pre-installed Windows Media Player and WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with Windows Media Player_ _(on a device running Windows 10_ _) and WonderShare Filmora._

## How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?

Imagine you’re in a situation where you have gone ahead and finished the filming portion of a project on your smartphone but realise that the capture footage is upside down. Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.

Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, _you will not be able to rotate the clip_. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.

Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.

### **TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER**

In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.

While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.

To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.

* Click on Organize.
* Then move onto Manage Libraries
* Now click on Videos.

## **An alternate way to** **Rotate** **Video with Wondershare Filmora**

With Windows Media Player only being a playback tool, we feel free software like [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are a great option to have installed on your device.

In Wondershare Filmora, footage rotation can only be done via the Edit Option — in my experience this straightforward approach felt quite simple and intuitive. And in case you wish to incorporate Keyframes into the rotation step, the feature is available near the Timeline.

_The emphasis on accessibility for every function in Filmora, provides a significant advantage. The use of modern iconography also betters the familiarity users may have with the software. These factors make Wondershare Filmora a great option to consider. If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

## The Bottom Line

Rotating video is unfortunately impossible in Windows Media Player, thus the access and ability to free software like Wondershare Filmora is a huge positive for the creative community. Speaking of how rotation is done in Filmora, the intuitive number-based system is a huge positive, as there are some software which prefer using swivels. The integration of Keyframes into a free tool is also welcome.

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in Windows Media Player and Wondershare Filmora. Once again, if you wish to not use a proper video editing tool, you can consider alternate players like VLC, which can rotate footage.

## **An alternate way to** **Rotate** **Video with Wondershare Filmora**

With Windows Media Player only being a playback tool, we feel free software like [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are a great option to have installed on your device.

In Wondershare Filmora, footage rotation can only be done via the Edit Option — in my experience this straightforward approach felt quite simple and intuitive. And in case you wish to incorporate Keyframes into the rotation step, the feature is available near the Timeline.

_The emphasis on accessibility for every function in Filmora, provides a significant advantage. The use of modern iconography also betters the familiarity users may have with the software. These factors make Wondershare Filmora a great option to consider. If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

## Practical Way to Resize Video in Handbrake

Videos are a great medium to share thoughts, concepts, guides, and memories, but regardless of how far technology has come getting them online can pose an issue sometimes. These obstacles often tend to be because either a video clip is too long or the amount of data in it is so high that the service just cannot upload the file to its servers and make it available for the intended receiver.

To solve this issue, users often need to resize a video so that the data cap, which behaved as a restriction, is no longer applicable. Now, there exist multiple software that can do this, and most video editor programs include the ability to export videos in less data-hungry sizes or formats.

So, if you ever face a similar issue, here is a guide on how you can resize videos via Handbrake and Wondershare Filmora. The former is a lightweight tool perfect for batch resizing videos, while the latter is a powerful free video editing software.

## How to resize video with Handbrake

Open Handbrake and follow the steps listed below.

Once open, the software will present you with options to either import a single video file for resize or a whole batch via folder selection.

**_Note:_** _If you do not have Handbrake, you can_ [_download it by visiting the official website_](https://handbrake.fr/)_. Also, you will need_ [_Windows .NET Framework 6.0_](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime?utm%5Fsource=getdotnetcore&utm%5Fmedium=referral) _to use Handbrake._ _If your system does not have the correct config Handbrake will let you know and fail to launch._

Once you have imported the video file, the software will present you with two choices.

* **Option 1:** Use a preset available in the application — the best choice for beginners to choose for beginners.
* **Option 2:** Set a custom resolution via the Dimensions Tab.

**_Note:_** _To ensure the resize is perfect, find out which file format plays best with the end location of your video and convert the video clip to that version._

How your screen will look once you have imported a video file.

### **How to Resize Video via Option 1**

**Step 1:** Import Video File by choosing

* Single Import, or
* Batch Import

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Choose a Preset in Handbrake.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Click on Start Encode after choosing the desired preset.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-4.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Wait for the Encode to finish. The application shows progress in a bar at the bottom of the screen.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Click on Browse in the bottom right corner to enter the Save File dialogue. At this point, you can set a file name and select a new save location.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-6.jpeg)

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-7.jpeg)

### **How to Resize Video via Option 2**

**Step 1:** Import Video File by choosing

* Single Import, or
* Batch Import

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-8.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Click on the Dimensions Tab to open up a dialog box that will let you edit video resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-9.jpeg)

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-10.jpeg)

The Dimensions Dialog Box

**Step 3:** Modify resolution to ensure the clip you get is in the right setup.

**_Note:_** _If you see 1920 x 1080 on your screen, the first number (1920) stands for the width of the video file, while the second number (1080) stands for the height._

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-11.jpeg)

**Tip**

The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide

_Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution._

## An easier way to resize video with Wondershare Filmora

While the resize feature in Handbrake is capable of working on multiple video files at once, the user interface of the application may seem daunting to some. Hence, if you’re just starting to learn, we recommend accessing more user-friendly software, say Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . You can resize videos in the video editor by following the steps we have detailed below.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.

**Step 1:** Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-12.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.

**Author’s Notes:** Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg)

Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision

**Step 4:** Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg)

With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.

**Note:** You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the **Project Settings** option, found under the **File Tab**.

## The Bottom Line

Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.

### **How to Resize Video via Option 2**

**Step 1:** Import Video File by choosing

* Single Import, or
* Batch Import

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-8.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Click on the Dimensions Tab to open up a dialog box that will let you edit video resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-10.jpeg)

The Dimensions Dialog Box

**Step 3:** Modify resolution to ensure the clip you get is in the right setup.

**_Note:_** _If you see 1920 x 1080 on your screen, the first number (1920) stands for the width of the video file, while the second number (1080) stands for the height._

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-11.jpeg)

**Tip**

The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide

_Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution._

## An easier way to resize video with Wondershare Filmora

While the resize feature in Handbrake is capable of working on multiple video files at once, the user interface of the application may seem daunting to some. Hence, if you’re just starting to learn, we recommend accessing more user-friendly software, say Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . You can resize videos in the video editor by following the steps we have detailed below.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.

**Step 1:** Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-12.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.

**Author’s Notes:** Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg)

Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision

**Step 4:** Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg)

With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.

**Note:** You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the **Project Settings** option, found under the **File Tab**.

## The Bottom Line

Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.

For macOS 10.12 or later

Step 1: Launch [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline. Now, trim the music to 30 seconds and listen to the end part. Select the last note to match the beat in the beginning part of the music.

![match note with the music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-1.jpg)

Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use "M" from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.

![add markers and adjust video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg)

Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.

![create widescreen cinemascope bar opener](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-3.jpg)

Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.

![match length of whole video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-4.jpg)

Step 5: After the animation is completed, head to the "Titles" tab and look for cinematic packs. Choose one and drag it onto the timeline. Secondly, alter the duration and animation of the title. The user is expected to insert a dissolve transition at the end of the title.

![adjust title of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-5.jpg)

Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the "Effects" tab to blur the video clips.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the "Animation" and then "Customize." Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the "Scale" percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!

Users can merge and unite videos up to 600MB in size using this fantastic video editing tool. This platform is popular among professionals due to its comprehensive cutting, cropping, combining, and effects editing services. More significantly, joining videos is completely free.

1. **Inshot**

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-9.jpg)

 This is a free video editing app that allows you to merge multiple videos into a single file. This is how:

1) Install and run Inshot.

2) Select Video.

3) Tap the check button after selecting multiple videos.

4) Optional: Here is where you can edit the videos. Select the 16:9 comprehensive video layout or another option by tapping Canvas.

1. **With iMovie**

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-10.jpg)

Apple's iMovie app is available for free on iPhones, iPad, and Mac. Here's how to combine two or more videos for an Instagram post:

1) Get iMovie and open it on your iPhone.

2) Select Movie from the Create Project menu.

3) Choose your movies. To see only the clips, go to the top left and tap Media, then Video. Choose a video and press the check button.

4) Tap Create Movie after selecting two or more video clips.

5) Swipe horizontally to the point where one video clip ends and another begins if desired. You can edit or remove the transition effect between videos by tapping the two triangle icon.

6) Optional: You can also experiment with other iMovie features such as adding music, text, and video speed changes. You can tap a video clip, tap the tiny plus icon, and zoom in and out with two fingers.

8) When you're done, tap Done in the top left corner.

9) From the bottom, tap the share button and select Save Video.

10) Your iPhone's Photos app now contains the merged clip. Open Instagram and make an individual post with the final combined Video.

This is how you can combine multiple clips into one Instagram video. I hope you found this quick tutorial helpful. Of course, you can merge two or more clips into one single video file using any other video editing app besides the ones listed above.

Here are a few simple methods for combining two or more videos into one and posting them on Instagram (IG).

Using the Instagram official app

There is no simple way to combine many videos into one on Instagram. You can, however, utilize the Story technique.

1) Create an Instagram Story with two or more videos. You can add stickers, text, and other elements if you like.

2) Tap the three dots icon on your Instagram Tale > Save > Save story. Your current Instagram Stories films and photos will be saved to the Photos app as a single video file.

3) Upload the resulting Video to Instagram!

**Tools To Use to Combine videos for Instagram.**

1. Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use video merger.

Before I detail online video joiners, I'd like to mention Wondershare Filmora, which can automatically merge video files without or with transitions. It merges video files with the same or various file extensions in 1:1 quality (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, .avi, etc). Continue reading to learn more about this simple video merging and how to merge videos.

Part 2: Using Filmora to combine, merge, and join clips

To join videos, first, import them.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-2.jpg)

You can drag the files from Windows File Explorer to the User's Album or click the "Import" button on the window and choose files from your computer. All imported files will appear in thumbnail format in the User's Album. To preview a file in the right-hand preview window, double-click it.

1. To merge video files, drag & drop them.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-3.jpg)

Move videos from the User's Album to the video track on the Timeline after that. All video files will be combined into a single video with no transition. However, you can use the following method to add transitions between video clips.

1. Add transitions in the third step (optional)

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-4.jpg)

Add transitions between clips for a smooth transition from one to the next to make the linked videos look like a complete movie. Go to the Transition tab and drag the desired change to the intersection of two clips. You can also right-click any transition to bring up a menu with choices such as "Apply to All" and "Random to All" for your convenience.

Step 4: Combine video files into a single file.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-5.jpg)

Now that you've seen the merged Movie click the "Export" option to save the several video segments to a single file. Select any format from the list under the Format tab. All of the most common video formats are supported. Choose "Device" and choose the thumbnail of your device to play the combined video file on iPod, iPhone, or iPad. You may also publish the combined Video on YouTube or burn it to DVDs to watch on television.

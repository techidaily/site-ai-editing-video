## Easy Steps to Add Miniature Effect to Videos

Want to add selective blur to make everything look smaller? Don't have any idea how to focus on specific mini-things? Then don't worry! In this article, you'll get a step-by-step process to add miniature effects to your video. At the end of the process, you'll have cinematic shots. Then start with us now! Scroll more to get pro tips!

## What Is a Miniature Effect?

![after adding a miniature effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-1.jpg)

But first, let's learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.

However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we're seeing is actually a tiny model.

![a miniature effect for landscape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:

* It utilizes **selective blur** to make things appear like **small**
* The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from **a high angle**.
* The tiny effect is usually used in **drone footage, time lapses**, or **landscape photography**.

Are you all set to add miniature effects to your video and make film-like shots? Then scroll more and get the step-by-step process.

## How to Make a Miniature effect?

You are excited to add a miniature effect, and enjoy the rest! Without any further delay, follow the below instructions and get results!

**Note:** you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.

Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!

![rotation of mask in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif)

For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can't get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:

![blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif)

* Make a building or any object **Blurry** near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.
* While the **object is far** from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.
* Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.

Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:

* Then click on the **Mask** tab to open it.
* Select the **Rectangular** mask from the list and apply it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.

Now, it's time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:

* Add the same stock video clip a **third time** on the third video track of the timeline.
* Then add a mask in a **Rectangle** shape on the building.
* Don't **blur** the edge of this mask.

![mask the object far from the camera for the main focus](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-13.gif)

##### Step2 Choose any stock footage

If you don't have good-quality footage, but want to boost your video, here is how. You can get the miniature effect without a big format view camera or specialized lens.

* Open Filmora and select any stock footage in Wondershare Filmora.

![choose stock footage from stock media in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-3.jpg)

* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.

Here you will see almost more than **20 videos.** So, instead of using the actual recorded footage, we'll make do with what we have by **default**. After selecting and adding the stock footage of your choice. Then you have to follow the below process:

* First, hold the Stock Footage as shown in the folder section.
* Then **Drag and Drop** it to the timeline section for further editing.

* The **latest version** has an unlimited stock library.
* After purchasing any plan, you can access **Stock Media** (Unsplash, Giphy, Pixabay, Pixel).

##### Step3 Head to the effect panel

As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a **Blur** effect on the video.

![search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-5.gif)

To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:

* First of all, move toward the above tabs.
* Then click on the 5th section, which is **Effect**
* After selecting the effect tab, a new window will **pop up**.
* In this section, we have **500+** different effects.
* Then, **click** on the search bar.
* **Search** for the Blur effect.
* After that, click on the **Blur 2**
* Then **Download** this effect if you haven't done this already.

##### Step4 Add the blur effect to the video

After selecting and downloading the blur effect, it's time to add it to the video. Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:

* **First, drag** and **Drop** the effect toward the timeline.
* Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.

![add effect on the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-6.gif)

##### Step5 Add the effect multiple times

Want to get an ideal blur level? If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:

* First, ensure that the **opacity** of the blur effect is 100%.
* Then, if you still want more blurriness, add **Blur 2** effect multiple times on the video.
* Finally, add effect by just the **Drag and Drop**

![add blur effect in video multiple times](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-7.gif)

##### Step6 Drop the same video clip

* Add the same video clip 2nd time on the timeline.
* Add it by just the **Drag and Drop**
* Make sure you add it to 2nd video track in the timeline above the first one.

## For Artists Who Are Making Videos for Show Their Knowledge or Projects, Add some Effects for the Video Can Always Provoke Interests and Attention. This Article Will Show You How to Do that Easily

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a powerful tool and with the know-how can make your art be more than just a still image. Whether it is for a music video or a portfolio showreel, there are better ways than just inserting an image and letting it fade to the next still image. We can make use of effects and transitions to put our art to better use.

In this guide I’m going to show a couple of ways to enhance your images within [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for your videos.

## Transitions

By inserting a transition to your image, you can add some diversity to how the viewer first see’s your image, You may want to emphasis a certain element of your art and therefore would select a transition that zooms in on that element before zooming out to the whole image or maybe you have a painting of a cyberpunk angel and wish to have the image enter in a grid formation. The point is that by experimenting with transitions and trying to select the best ones based on the element in your work you will achieve a better first impression. This is true for all aspects of video creation.

Having multiple transitions can create a unique look for your videos with minimal understanding of how to create a transition but there needs to be an understanding of how the layers work in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) being that a layer on top is in front of the one below, remember this when you start to add transitions as sometime you may need to duplicate your art as to keep it in the shot.

As you can see here, I have duplicated my image onto separate channels as to always keep the image in the scene.

In the image above you can see how I used multiple transitions, I did this as my image is off center and I wanted to emphasize that, I picked transitions that had clear symmetry and lines so that the viewer had a reference point of where center was without me having to place that in my art. This is a very useful way of adding information to your art without telling the viewer directly. As for the color theory, I went with oranges and yellows predominantly here as they are neighboring colors on the color wheel and we know they work well together with my main color of yellow. As for the composition I have tried to keep all the eye-catching points along the top third of the image as to create a piece more pleasing to the eye even with all this information going on.

## Effects

The inclusion of effect onto your art should not be discouraged depending on what the art is used for, in my example i created this as though it was album art and the musician wanted to upload a simple music video using that art, on its own it is static and can loose engagement but by applying relevant effects you can capture the viewer's eye and make the listening experience more enjoyable. Effects can also be stacked to create unique assets for your art and help tell a story, if your art includes fire why not add a fire effect breaking the stillness of the image or maybe your art has motion, you could include a motion effect to your still image and give the viewer more information.

Even when using effects you can use fundamentals such as color theory or composition to better enhance your imagery.

In this image you can see I have added an audio visualizer effect as well as a spectral light effect. I did this to reinforce the face of my image having a strong light source, it creates dynamic movement and the audio visualizer was added due to the nature of the video being music oriented but I felt this could have been done better. The composition of the audio visualizer was front and center and seemed boring and uninteresting. This is where the research into art fundamentals comes into play as remembering the rule of thirds and how all the main features of the image are in the top horizontal third, we can make use of the vertical thirds to gain a better composition and hopefully create more engagement.

As you can see, we have duplicated the audio visualizer and made better use of the thirds nor having opposing placement within the scene, the same information is being given by the effect but we have managed to use the space more effectively and created a visually pleasing aesthetic to our video. Trick like this can make your still image feel more animated and have more purpose within the video itself.

## Adding Titles and Text

Adding text is another way of adding information to your art. It's said an image can speak a thousand words but sometimes you need words to talk for an image. When words are needed for your video, there should be some thought into how them words are presented as just selecting any text and inserting that to your video may look jarring to the viewer and result in a loss of interest towards your videos. Selecting the right transition for your text or the color or even the font can have different results and can help with affordance depending on what you're looking to portray.

In my example I wanted to say thank you and felt sharp edges would seem formal and because of the main image it would be too similar so I went with a font that was more rounded. When inserting text onto a scene such as this one you are given a lot of information for your selections, we already have color in there to help us choose our font and background color, I went with yellow and pink due to the fact it was already in the scene and I didn’t want to take the attention away from the focus. The way the text transitions onto the screen secures just enough attention to itself that the viewer knows it's there and can read it if they wish to. If I wanted to gain full attention i would have picked a transition that overlaps the key element and picked complementary colors on the opposite sides of the color wheel guaranteeing the viewer's eyes would notice and engage with the motion.

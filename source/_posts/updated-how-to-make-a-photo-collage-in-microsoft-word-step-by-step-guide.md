## Detailed Guide to Resize Your Video in VLC

Videos are one of the most popular types of content on the internet. There are millions of videos uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, and other video-sharing sites each day. Sharing your videos with others is possible when you know how to resize them in VLC. VLC is a free media player that allows you to convert or compress your videos in order to make them smaller for uploading or downloading.

Videos are a great way to showcase your business, company, or product on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But what happens when you use the wrong size for your video? The whole thing looks distorted and low quality. It's not very appealing.

Luckily, resizing videos in VLC is simple. All you need is the right software and the right steps.

This blog post will walk you through how to resize videos using VLC. We'll cover what the default settings are for video resolutions, how to change them, and why it's important to know what size of video you're uploading before uploading it.

So without further ado, let's get started!

## Step by step to resize your video in VLC

Anyone who has a lot of videos on their computer knows how frustrating it can be to find the video you want among the hundreds of ones you have. Well, VLC makes it possible to resize your videos so they'll fit onto your desktop. Here's how:

### Resizing by converting to a smaller file size

Because some video formats, such as MKV and AVI, take up too much space, it's a good idea to convert videos to smaller formats, such as FLV, WMV, and so on. To lower the video size, you'll be pleased to learn that VLC allows you to convert video/audio files without the need to install any other software. The video conversion guide for VLC can be found below.

Step 1: Launch the VLC Media Player.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-1.png)

Step 2: Go to the menu and pick Media > Convert/Save from the drop-down menu, then Add > Convert/Save from the drop-down menu.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-2.png)

Step 3: Choose a profile for the video you wish to convert.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-3.png)

Step 4: Select the Start button to start VLC video compression.

### Resizing by cutting unnecessary video segment

Step 1: Launch the VLC Media Player

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-4.png)

Step 2: Go to Menu > View Menu > Advanced Controls in VLC Media Player and select it from the menu.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-5.png)

Step 3: Play the video you want to crop and then click the Record button on the scene you want to crop and then the same button to pause the video where you want to crop it.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-6.png)

Step 4: In Windows 7, 8, and XP, the film will automatically save in Library > Videos, and in My Documents > My Videos in Windows 7.

VLC Media Player is unquestionably one of the greatest video players available for free. Nonetheless, it isn't the finest video reduction because it just reduces the size of videos by using certain simple parameters rather than complex ones. As a result, we offer Fimora, an all-in-one video toolbox that can convert, compress, download, record, edit, burn, and more, as a better video compressor. You can change the video resolution, bit rate, encoder, format, and other settings to compress video and audio files in a variety of formats.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-4.png)

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-5.png)

Step 4: In Windows 7, 8, and XP, the film will automatically save in Library > Videos, and in My Documents > My Videos in Windows 7.

VLC Media Player is unquestionably one of the greatest video players available for free. Nonetheless, it isn't the finest video reduction because it just reduces the size of videos by using certain simple parameters rather than complex ones. As a result, we offer Fimora, an all-in-one video toolbox that can convert, compress, download, record, edit, burn, and more, as a better video compressor. You can change the video resolution, bit rate, encoder, format, and other settings to compress video and audio files in a variety of formats. Follow the simple steps below to get this VLC compressor replacement on your Windows/Mac for free.

### Step by Step on How to Resize Videos using Filmora

Resizing videos in Filmora is a quick and easy process. To resize videos, first make sure you have imported your video file into the editor.

**Resizing by changing the dimensions**

Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop the file on the screen or click on "Import Files" in the toolbar.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-7.png)

Step 2: Once you've imported your video, select the video clips that you want to resize by clicking on them; then, resizing them is as simple as dragging their borders!

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-8.png)

Step 3: You can also use the size fields at the bottom of the frame to change their dimensions.

Step 4: Keep in mind that changing one dimension of a video clip will affect both its width and height proportionally. For example, if you enlarge a 16:9 widescreen clip to 720p (from 480p), it will be double its original proportions (720x480).

**Resizing by shrinking video file size.**

Step 1: To import a video file, either drag and drop it onto the screen or use the toolbar's "Import Files" option.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-9.png)

Step 2: Open the video shrinker's output window by clicking the "Export" button.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-10.png)

Step 3: Select the Format tab and keep the video in its original format as a result. Then, in the "Settings" panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by choosing a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. When it comes to video formats, you can choose among FLV, MP4, and other similar formats, which normally result in smaller files.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-11.png)

Step 4: The shrunk file should be exported.

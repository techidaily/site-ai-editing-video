## How to Trim Videos in PowerPoint

Many people use Microsoft PowerPoint to prepare basic animated explainers and presentations, but you can learn how to trip or crop videos in this program with the tools that it provides. With that in mind, here is how to trim, reset, or edit videos in PowerPoint.

### How to Trim a Video in PowerPoint

You can trip unnecessary content at the start or end of your video clip. However, you can only trim videos you have inserted from your PC, as this feature is not yet available for videos on the web. Follow the steps below to learn how to trim video in PowerPoint.

1. If you are in a slide containing a media placeholder, click on Insert Video from File. A window will open; select the From a File option.
2. Find the video file on your PC and select it. Then, click the arrow that's right next to the Insert button. Choose either the Link to File or Insert option and your video will appear on the slide.
3. If you are not using a slide that has a media placeholder, find the Insert tab and click Video on My PC. You will be able to locate the video file on your PC.
4. You are now ready to trim video PowerPoint.
5. Select your video, and the Playback tab will appear. Navigate to the Editing area of the ribbon and hit the Trim Video button.

### How to Reset or Edit a Trimmed Video in PowerPoint

5. Go back to the slide that contains your trimmed video, which has now been compressed.
6. Right-click the compressed video, and select the Save Media As option.

#### How to Play Video Inside a Shape

If you want to edit your video and enhance its appearance, you can have it play inside a unique shape instead of the usual rectangle format that videos play in. In turn, you'll draw attention to your video.

To play your video in an unusual shape, select your video and navigate to the Format tab. Then, go to the Video Shape menu, where you'll see multiple shapes to choose from.

Applying preset video styles is a simple process. Select the video, then navigate to the Format tab. Click More under the Video Style section.

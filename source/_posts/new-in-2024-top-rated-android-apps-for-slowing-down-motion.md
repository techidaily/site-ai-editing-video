You can also set preferences for Edge Thickness or Edge Feather for accuracy. Afterward, you can introduce three background options: color, grid, or more.

#### 3\. [AI Text-to-Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Bring your imagination to visuals with this amazing generative AI video creator. It creates videos from text and covers the voice and graphical elements. Users can customize the AI voice and ratio before generating a video. The prompt section offers up to 1000 characters for adding a script or giving directions.

#### 4\. [AI Smart Masking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Are there any effects or filters you want to introduce to only a specific part of the video? Use Filmora's AI mask for automated masking of an object or background. The mask brush selects the relevant area on its own. Besides AI masks, there is a manual masking option or mask shapes to apply. You can also customize the Brush size according to the video.

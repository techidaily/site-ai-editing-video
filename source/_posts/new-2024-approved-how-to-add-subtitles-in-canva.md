After installing it, Color Finale 2 will be accessible under "Video Effects." Simply drag and drop it onto the desired clips to use it. Alternately, make an adjustment layer and apply it to your entire video.

The use of curves, vectors, color wheels, and HSL curves will be available to editors. These can all be utilized in layers. Additionally, rearranging and modifying the layers is simple. The masking and an enhanced LUTs browser are two of Color Finale 2's finest additions. Masks are easy to handle and apply to video clips, and they have a great tracking capability. This makes it simpler for editors to isolate particular colors or sections inside film for intricate coloring.

Additionally, with Color Finale 1, the LUTs browser has been improved. LUTs are now much simpler to go through and preview. Additionally, Color Finale can be shown the location of your computer's favorite LUTs for rapid application. Alternately, you might make your own LUTs and store them for use in later projects.

As Final Cut Pro X natively supports R3D/ProRes RAW files, there's no necessity to support them. Inside the extension, you can change the transcoding codec, color space, output file resolution, delayering mode, and highlight recovery. Color Finale Transcoder lets you change RAW files' color temperature/tint, ISO, and sharpness/detail. Import a preview LUT to see how your film will look.

While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

**Step 2: Color Selection**

## Part 1: Why is My Snapchat Camera Zoomed in?

In this section, we will highlight some key issues that are causing your zoomed-in camera on Snapchat. By identifying the root causes of the problem, you can better work on its solution:

### 1\. Snapchat Cache

One of the main reasons that the Snapchat camera zoomed-in error occurs is due to cache data. As Snapchat contains our pictures and videos with added filters, the storage or cache data gets occupied as a result. So, due to this reason, the app struggles with storing more data and starts showing malfunctions like a zoomed in camera.

### 2\. Device Incompatibility

In some situations, there are possibilities that your device does not support Snapchat due to incompatible issues. It can happen due to internal bugs in your device, which is why your Snapchat camera does not work appropriately.

### 3\. Internal Issue with Snapchat

If your device does not contain bugs, then surely there must be an internal issue with your Snapchat app. This situation mostly occurs when you download additional filters and effects on Snapchat through third-party tools. Consequently, Snapchat starts displaying small bugs during the usage of its camera.

### 4\. Camera Settings

Sometimes, you are not properly aware of your camera settings in the device and app. If the camera settings of your device are adjusted in a certain way, it may affect the camera settings of the Snapchat app.

## Part 2: How to Fix Snapchat Camera Zoomed in Problem?

### For iOS Users

As restarting the iPhone differs from model to model, here are the separate steps for each model.

**For iPhone X and Latest Models**

To restart the iPhone of these models, press and firmly hold the "Power" or any of the "Volume" buttons simultaneously. A slider will display on the screen saying "Slide to Power Off," through which you have to drag the slider in the right direction. After waiting for some seconds, to restart the iPhone, you have to press and hold the “Power” button until you can see the Apple logo.

**For iPhone SE and Earlier Models**

For restarting, press and firmly hold the “Power” button until a slider appears on the screen. Drag the slider saying “Slide to Power Off” to the right to turn off your phone. Wait for some time and then again press and hold the “Power” button until an Apple logo appears.

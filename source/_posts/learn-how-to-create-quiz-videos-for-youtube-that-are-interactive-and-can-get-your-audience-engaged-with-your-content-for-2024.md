It helps to indulge the audience with your content and show the after and before transitions. You can try this with any object or any character. But first, let's figure out the requirements for rotating effects.

## Part 2\. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect

You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.

### The Subject Matters

To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it's you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:

* The person should get two different costumes.
* All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting
* Show affinity and control of the camera.

![character of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-2.png)

### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

**Note:** Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.

![smartphone for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png)

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

## How to Make Text Reveal Effect Easily

Have you ever seen the text reveal led by a subject when moving across the frame? It's one of the most common text-revealing effects in video editing. This technique is often used to add titles or credits to a scene for cinematic vibes and creative effects.

While it may look complicated, it's actually quite easy to create with a video editing program like Filmora. Filmora's masking feature allows users to create impressive and eye-catching text reveals in their videos. For those looking for a tutorial on how to make text reveal, here's a step-by-step guide to help you out.

## How to add text reveal effect using [Filmora's](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) masking tool

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

First, make sure the video clips you are using are clear, with the subject moving across the frame. It will help the text to stand out and be more easily seen. Now, follow the step-by-step guides below:

##### Step 1 Add video tracks

You will need three video tracks in order to create this effect, so click the (+) icon above the timeline > Add Video Track and add two more video tracks.

![import the clip to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-2.jpg)

##### Step 3 Make a cut at the beginning of the text

Find the spot where you want the text reveals to start, then click the scissor icon to make a cut on the clip from the first video track.

![make a cut at the beginning of the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-3.jpg)

##### Step 4 Add and adjust the text

Go to Title > Plain Text > select which text styles suit you best. Then, drag the title to the second video track.

![double-click on the title clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-5.gif)

##### Step 5 Use the masking tool

![use the masking tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-6.jpg)

![make more cuts on the top latter clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-7.gif)

Double-click on each of the smaller clips and find the mask settings.

![double-click on each of the smaller clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-8.jpg)

Since the subject in this tutorial is moving from side to side, we are going to match the mask's y-axis setting, which is also the revealed text portion, with the subject's movement. Starting from the first clip, adjust the y-axis number to a smaller/bigger number.

![adjust the y-axis number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-9.gif)

There we go! The final look should look like this:

Since the subject in this tutorial is moving from side to side, we are going to match the mask's y-axis setting, which is also the revealed text portion, with the subject's movement. Starting from the first clip, adjust the y-axis number to a smaller/bigger number.

## Part III. Bonus Tips for Changing Video Speed in Lightworks

Now that you know how to speed up video Lightworks, here are some important tips to pay attention to. These tips will help you edit your video better, especially when you are tweaking the speed factor.

**Lightworks speed up part of a video** \- If you want to speed up only a certain part of your video, you need to split the video. All you need to do is reposition the playhead and click the "C" icon to split the video. Thereafter, you can select any split portion of the video and follow the steps to change the speed.

**Audio Video Syncing** \- You can alter the speed of the video as well as the audio on Lightworks. When you are performing speed-up video in Lightworks, you should ideally change the speed of the audio. This will make the video and the audio stay in sync so that it does not sound awkward.

**Work with Frame Rate** \- If you know beforehand that you will change the speed of a certain scene, you should set the frame rate accordingly. If you want to slow down a video, you should shoot it at a higher frame rate. Similarly, if you want to speed up your video, you should shoot it at a lower frame rate. This is because, after the change of speed in Lightworks, the frame rate will be usual rather than abnormal. The video will be soothing to the eyes of the viewers.

## Part IV. Is There an Easier Way to Change Video Speed?

You can choose from presets, customize speed uniformly as well as vary the speed through the video through curvy graphs. We will illustrate all the different ways to change the speed of your video on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

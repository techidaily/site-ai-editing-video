 Studio is a video editing software created by  Systems. This video editing software became one of the first commercially available video editors aimed at the typical home user. The software was originally developed to assist in the production of television and broadcast content, but has since been used for a multitude of other purposes. As one of the most popular digital video editors of all time,  Studio is now used by a wide variety of users, from home-users to professionals who require high-quality editing and effects.

Corrective methods have been implemented, and improvements are constantly being made. You shouldn't overlook the application as it may lose some functionality over time. It had been pulled from the list, but came back just a few years later and remains one of the best video editing applications on the market.

The latest  Studio has a number of new features, including a redesigned title editor, dynamic masking, face tracking, and an in-depth keyframing control.

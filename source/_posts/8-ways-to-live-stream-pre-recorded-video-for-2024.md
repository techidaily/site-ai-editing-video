While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle.

How to Make a GIF With Transparent Background?

#### In this article

01 [Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?](#Part 1)

02 [Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

## How to Make Video Slow Motion?

Slow-motion videos are in trend now, especially when shooting for [Instagram Reels](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), TikTok videos, or [YouTube Shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.

That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.

#### In this article

01 [How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?](#part1)

02 [How to Apply the Smooth Slow-Motion Effect in Post-Production?](#part2)

03 [When to Use Slow Motion?](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences**

Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between **120** FPS and **240** FPS as needed. Tap **1x** from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.

![adjust slow motion zoom level iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-slow-motion-zoom-level-iphone.jpg)

**Step 3: Start and Stop Recording**

Tap the **Record** button from the bottom-center of the screen to begin recording the video in slow motion. Tap **Stop** when you are done. You can access the recorded video from the **Videos** container of the **Photos** app in your iPhone.

## Part 2: How to Apply the Smooth Slow-Motion Effect in Post-Production?

If you don’t have access to a camera that can record videos in slow motion, or in case you want to capture the footage at normal playback speed and then slow it down later, you need a dedicated tool to get the job done. Even though several post-production applications are available in the market, the one that is most versatile, has an intuitive interface, and is quite easy to use is [Filmora video editor from Wondershare](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The latest version of the app, i.e., Wondershare Filmora 11 has a new feature called Speed Ramping that enables you to graphically manage the speed of the clips.

Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:

**Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window**

Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the **Speed Ramping** window.

**Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip**

Go to the **Speed Ramping** tab if it is not already selected, click **Custom** from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.

Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.

To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click **Add Adjust Point** from the left of the **Speed Ramping** window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.

![use filmora speed ramping slow down video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-filmora-speed-ramping-slow-down-video.jpg)

**Step 3: Freeze the Video**

Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click **Add Freeze Frame** from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click **OK**.

![add freeze frame speed ramping filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-freeze-frame-speed-ramping-filmora.jpg)

After adding a freeze point, optionally, you can drag and reposition it in the **Speed Ramping** timeline as needed. Finally, click **OK** from the bottom-right area to save the changes.

## Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:

**Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window**

Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the **Speed Ramping** window.

**Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip**

Go to the **Speed Ramping** tab if it is not already selected, click **Custom** from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.

Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.

To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click **Add Adjust Point** from the left of the **Speed Ramping** window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.

![use filmora speed ramping slow down video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-filmora-speed-ramping-slow-down-video.jpg)

**Step 3: Freeze the Video**

Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click **Add Freeze Frame** from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click **OK**.

![add freeze frame speed ramping filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-freeze-frame-speed-ramping-filmora.jpg)

After adding a freeze point, optionally, you can drag and reposition it in the **Speed Ramping** timeline as needed. Finally, click **OK** from the bottom-right area to save the changes.

## Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

If you are a professional video or image creator, you know what aspect ratio is and why aspect ratio is important. Even people passionate about their cameras and visual art enthusiasts know it. If you are a newbie, Let us make it easy for you. This article will talk about the vertical phone aspect ratio ratio, its definition, types, iPhone vertical video dimensions, etc. We’ll also provide you solid tips on mobile vertical video size and how to create phone vertical videos easily. Let’s jump into the topic and see what you can learn.

#### In this article

01 [What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?](#Part 1)

02 [Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical](#Part 2)

03 [Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

"

| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |
| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

## Part 2 Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical

● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)

![9:16 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-3.png)

When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.

The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16\. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.

Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.

* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.

## How To Change Speed of Video in Final Cut Pro?

When there are certain boring but necessary parts in your video, you need to speed them up. Similarly, you may need to reduce the duration of the entire video. Speeding up the video is your only option when you do not want to cut any part. You must have also observed that certain videos look funny when you speed them up. To speed up videos, you will need a video editor that does not degrade the video quality.

Final Cut Pro is a popular choice to speed up video without distorting the pitch. Many think that the video quality can degrade when they change the speed of the video clip. This concern can be taken care of when you alter the video speed with Final Cut Pro. Instead of changing the speed of the entire video, you can change the speed of specific parts. We will illustrate how to speed up the video using Final Cut Pro and suggest a better choice than FCP.

![speed up the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-1.jpg)

## Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro

You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.

**Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -**

By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video's speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.

**Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -**

You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project's frame rate.

You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.

![speed up automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

**Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -**

Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.

The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.

## Part III. The Right Final Cut Pro Alternative for Changing Speed - Filmora

## Creating Video Testimonials

Video testimonials are a powerful way to generate trust and conversions. The key is to create videos that showcase your best customers’ most flattering moments, but you need the right elements in place first.

## Your script is vital

![write your script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/write-your-script.jpg)

You know you need a script, but how do you make sure it's good?

* First, make sure it's clear and concise. Don't waste time on lengthy descriptions or flowery language. Your video should be easy to understand, so let the script do the heavy lifting for you. Don't get overly wordy; use short sentences and phrases that keep the viewer engaged throughout your testimonial.
* Next, research your subject matter thoroughly before writing any script content at all. This will ensure that people watching feel like they're getting an accurate portrayal of their company/product/service rather than just hearing what they want while they're busy doing something else (like trying out a new app).
* Lastly, once researched thoroughly enough to write detailed scripts, start working on writing those scripts into something coherent but still engaging enough for anyone watching regardless of whether they have any prior knowledge about whatever topic is being discussed by way of video testimonials.

## Your talent is important

Talent is the most important element in creating a quality video testimonial, and this may seem like an obvious statement. However, it is important that you recruit someone who represents your brand well. This can be a celebrity, thought leader, or customer. If you are working with celebrities, for example, make sure they represent your products or services well and are not just there for the money (or social media).

If you are working with someone like a celebrity, be sure to interview them beforehand so that their story feels natural when telling it in front of the camera. In addition to finding someone who fits well with your product/service offering and brand image; look at other aspects such as age range and ethnicity when picking an appropriate talent partner.

## Use only HD resolution

![use only hd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-only-hd-resolution.jpg)

* HD resolution is the minimum resolution you should use. If you're shooting a project that doesn't need to be broadcast at a high quality, then we recommend shooting your testimonial in standard definition (SD). But if it's possible, or if you have a higher budget, consider investing in HD equipment and filming in 720p or higher.
* This can make all of the difference when it comes to the clarity and quality of the video. Plus, when using HD cameras and editing software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Final Cut, or Adobe Premiere, you'll get more than just better-looking images—you'll also be able to export files that are larger than those created by SD cameras.

## Filming elements are essential

![filming elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filming-elements.jpg)

To get the most out of your video testimonial, first, you need to be close to the camera and look directly into it. This will increase the rapport between you and your customers, making them feel like they are right there with you—and in turn creating trust.

Then, you also need to be wearing good quality clothing that fits well. Having an outfit that makes you look attractive (but not overly sexy) can make all the difference when it comes to conveying confidence and professionalism.

Finally, smile while filming! This is important because smiling helps people connect with those around them better than any other facial expression can do alone. If possible, try smiling even before turning on your camera so that people can see who they are dealing with before having any contact at all!

## Where to place the videos

![share testimonial vdieo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/share-testimonial-vdieo.jpg)

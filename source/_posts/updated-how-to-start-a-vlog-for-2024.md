## How to Start a Vlog

I’m Maya of Mayang Dyosa on YouTube channel, vlogger since 2017 and I started my vlogging career out of boredom. I give up my managerial career so that I can watch over my child.

Until I continued to upload and others requested the video what they want to see on my channel.

## **Wrapping Things Up**

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video. No matter how wonderful or perfect a video clip is, if the audio playing while watching it is terrible, it may be a very frustrating experience. So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

1. Navigate to the "Edit" page.
2. Select the tab "Media Pool."
3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

It's best to link the soundtrack (music, sound effect, or background music) to the relevant video once you've adjusted the audio file.

Here's how to connect audio and video in a timeline:

1. Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" to toggle both the video and audio.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."
3. The sound and visual are now both connected.

Thus, you can rest guaranteed that the audio will follow your movie wherever it goes. There will be no issues with out-of-sync!

### **How Do You Link Many Audio and Video Files Together in DaVinci Resolve?**

Several video and audio segments can be linked together to form a single one. You can rearrange them anywhere in the timeline, and they will not be out of sync.

This is how you connect many clips:

1. By holding down the "Ctrl" or "Cmd" key, you can choose all the video and audio clips you want.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcut keys "Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L".
3. Now, all your video or audio files are linked together.

### **Is Any Music Available to Use for Editing?**

Understanding copyright law can be complicated. It's best to use free music for video editing if you don't want to be accused of copyright violation.

Additionally, you can purchase two licenses to avoid copyright concerns. The producer controls the synchronization license, and the master license to use the song recording is managed by the publishing company.

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

### **Is There Any Free Music in DaVinci Resolve?**

DaVinci Resolve does not include any free music; however, it does include royalty-free sound effects noise. To get started, you can download and install the available sound package.

### **What Software Provides Free Music?**

The Audio Collection in Wondershare Filmora has over 50 royalty-free audio tracks for videos, with more to come.

In addition, Filmora has 25 sound effects, including animal sounds, video game sounds, and beeps. With Filmora, you may use more advanced editing features like keyframing, background noise elimination, cut, trim, crop, PIP effects, green-screen effects, and more to add free-choice music to your film.

Filmora will enhance the appeal of your video by giving free background music. You may also tweak the background sound, such as speeding up and slowing down, fade-in and fade-out.

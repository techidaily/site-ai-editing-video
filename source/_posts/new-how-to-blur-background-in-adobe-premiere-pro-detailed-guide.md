## Part 1\. Why Do You Need To Blur The Video Background?

The blurred background effect is a useful technique used by many professionals to create a focus on the element in the video and remove any distortions. By doing so, they add emphasis on the most important on-screen subject and make it pop on the screen.

You may need to blur the video background for several reasons. Perhaps you're recording a tutorial and want to add focus on one element, or maybe you're filming a scene in a crowded public place and wish to minimize distractions in your video.

Blurring the BG can also be a way to add a creative touch to your video or make them more immersive, polished, and professional.

## Part 2\. How To Blur Your Background In Premiere Pro?

Below, we’ve provided a step-by-step guide to help you **blur the background in Premiere Pro:**

Step1 In the first step, open a browser and visit the [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/elements-family/premiere-elements/download-trial/try.html) download page.

## Part 1 What Is AI Upscaling? And Why AI Upscaling Is Significant?

The process of generating or creating additional pixels of an image or frame in a video is AI Upscaling. This has many good results on the final video output.

This is mainly done to raise the bit rate of the video and, therefore, slightly improve the visual quality of the video. This is also used to improve the picture quality of DVDs and other low-quality videos. It is done to support lower quality videos or pictures on higher resolution screens like TV. This kind of upscaling is mostly done in TVs automatically.

## Part 2 How to Easily AI Upscale Video to 1080p or 4K?

The interesting part is that this upscaling is done by the higher resolution device itself. If you display a lower resolution video on a high-resolution TV, the TV will upscale the video quality of the lower resolution video. This process mainly happens by the displaying device itself. But you can try to upscale videos by yourself using this software, which will help you achieve the best results.

Step3 Select a foreground video

The first video is called the foreground video, which serves as the base video to achieve the desired double exposure effect. It is important to choose neutral or calm colors to make it easier for you to remove the background and highlight the main subject of your video.

Step4 Edit the foreground video

![adjust the color settings of the foreground video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-4.jpg)

## Part 2\. Polishing Your Music Video

Just like ladies apply polish to their nails to make them more attractive, you can use editing to your music video to get the same result. Ladies can go to the beautician if they want. You can go to a professional editor if you like it.

However, these options are pretty expensive. The best way is to do it yourself. It is fun. Also, you can let loose your hidden artist for a while. Stick to the following points to understand how to begin polishing your music video.

### How to put cuts on beats?

Adding beat cuts to a music video is imperative. Randomly placing beats yield an inferior-quality video. It also gives the impression that video editing is not done by a professional. The beats must be adjusted to synchronize with the storyline of the video.

Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.

##### What are the beats?

Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern. They are essential for music videos. It adds attraction for the viewers. Also, without beats, no music video can go viral. In the digital age, beats boost your music video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Cuts are recommended on every 2nd and 4th beat. In that way, a smooth transition of music beats takes place, making it more ear-pleasing. It also gives a professional outlook to the whole music.

Let's learn how you can put cuts on your beats.

##### Step1Import the music video

* Import the Music video to which you would like to add any beat.
* You can also use the one given in Filmora.
* Drag and Drop the music video in the timeline panel.

![importing video in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/importing-video-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step2Detach its audio

![beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/beat-detection-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Cut the beats where you find necessary

* Listen carefully to the audio file and plan where you want to add a cut to your beat.

![cutting the beat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/cutting-the-beat-in-filmora.jpg)

* Adjust the beat according to your music video.

Once you've added cuts to the beats, it is time to make them smooth. For that, keep reading the instructions given below.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Let us understand from the example given below.

* **Shot 1**: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.

##### What are light leaks?

Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.

Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.

Now, you are done with adding some additional color and light to your cuts. Your cuts are now smooth and trouble-free. Moving onto our next tip that will further polish your music video. It is called Reframing and Zooming.

### Reframe and zoom to polish your video

Another significant feature of Filmora is that it allows you to readjust the frame and zoom of the video. Any zooming option left undone in the shooting phase can be addressed in the editing phase.

For example, a director did an excellent job shooting a video. He considered every angle and yielded the best video shoot he could achieve. However, he missed a few zooming-out techniques while shooting. Now, what should one do? Use Filmora.

It is where the reframing and zooming feature of Filmora comes into play and saves the day.

##### What are the reframing and zooming features?

This feature allows you to adjust the zoom on the point of interest in the music video. If you want to add extra focus on a certain point, the feature in Filmora can do that for you. You can run zoom in or zoom out on any particular object or actor. Follow the given steps to understand how you can do that.

##### Step2Choose any two points on the clip for reframing

* Choose any two points on the clip. These points are reference points. When the clip moves from one point to the next point, the reframing takes place.

##### Step3Adjust the scale and position of the clip

* Go to the Transform option in Clip properties.
* Go to the clip's end (2nd point), and turn on the Scale and Position circles.

## Part 2\. Polishing Your Music Video

Just like ladies apply polish to their nails to make them more attractive, you can use editing to your music video to get the same result. Ladies can go to the beautician if they want. You can go to a professional editor if you like it.

However, these options are pretty expensive. The best way is to do it yourself. It is fun. Also, you can let loose your hidden artist for a while. Stick to the following points to understand how to begin polishing your music video.

### How to put cuts on beats?

Adding beat cuts to a music video is imperative. Randomly placing beats yield an inferior-quality video. It also gives the impression that video editing is not done by a professional. The beats must be adjusted to synchronize with the storyline of the video.

Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.

##### What are the beats?

Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern. They are essential for music videos. It adds attraction for the viewers. Also, without beats, no music video can go viral. In the digital age, beats boost your music video.

**Note:** Cuts are recommended on every 2nd and 4th beat. In that way, a smooth transition of music beats takes place, making it more ear-pleasing. It also gives a professional outlook to the whole music.

Let's learn how you can put cuts on your beats.

##### Step1Import the music video

* Import the Music video to which you would like to add any beat.
* You can also use the one given in Filmora.
* Drag and Drop the music video in the timeline panel.

![importing video in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/importing-video-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step2Detach its audio

* Right-click on the video.
* Select the option "Detach Audio." It will separate the attached audio from the music. You will be able to add cuts where you deem necessary.

![detach audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-in-filmora.jpg)

You can also import audio from your drive. After that, drag and drop the imported file into the timeline panel.

* Right, Click on the audio file in the audio panel.
* Select the option **"Beat Detection."** It will show beats (with red markers) on the audio timeline, making adding cuts to the beat easy.

![beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/beat-detection-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Cut the beats where you find necessary

* Listen carefully to the audio file and plan where you want to add a cut to your beat.

![cutting the beat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/cutting-the-beat-in-filmora.jpg)

* Adjust the beat according to your music video.
* Join the trimmed video segments to maintain continuity. The final product should look like the one given below.

![adjusting cut to the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjusting-cut-to-the-music-video.jpg)

Resultantly, it will readjust the beat to a different spot on the video. You can make multiple cuts in the beats. However, it is not recommended. It makes the whole experience of listening quite jarring.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Let us understand from the example given below.

* **Shot 1**: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.

##### What are light leaks?

Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.

Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.

##### Step4Fit the effect to the width of the screen

![final result after light leak effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-result-after-light-leak-effect.gif)

Now, you are done with adding some additional color and light to your cuts. Your cuts are now smooth and trouble-free. Moving onto our next tip that will further polish your music video. It is called Reframing and Zooming.

### Reframe and zoom to polish your video

Another significant feature of Filmora is that it allows you to readjust the frame and zoom of the video. Any zooming option left undone in the shooting phase can be addressed in the editing phase.

For example, a director did an excellent job shooting a video. He considered every angle and yielded the best video shoot he could achieve. However, he missed a few zooming-out techniques while shooting. Now, what should one do? Use Filmora.

It is where the reframing and zooming feature of Filmora comes into play and saves the day.

This feature allows you to adjust the zoom on the point of interest in the music video. If you want to add extra focus on a certain point, the feature in Filmora can do that for you. You can run zoom in or zoom out on any particular object or actor. Follow the given steps to understand how you can do that.

##### Step2Choose any two points on the clip for reframing

* Choose any two points on the clip. These points are reference points. When the clip moves from one point to the next point, the reframing takes place.

##### Step3Adjust the scale and position of the clip

* Go to the Transform option in Clip properties.
* Go to the clip's end (2nd point), and turn on the Scale and Position circles.

![clicking on the circles in front of scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-scale-and-position-of-the-clip.jpg)

* Go to the start of the clip
* And adjust the value of scale and position.

Atl Text: Setting new value to Scale and Position.

##### Step4Replay the clip

* Once the scale readings and position in the initial point are set, replay the clip to observe the reframing.

![final result after reframing of the image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-result-after-reframing-of-the-image.gif)

## Tips for Editing Your Music Videos

Now that you have the ideal editing tool to take your videos from drab to fab, here are a few tips to help you along the way.

* Ensure you set the output file to the appropriate resolution to avoid lowering the quality of the video you edit.
* Resist the temptation to insert the artsy shots before you lay a basic framework. It would be wise to focus on the musician's performance before you insert shots of the beautiful scenery.
* As you edit, it would help to create a storyline that matches the lyrics. You could create a simple story or a complex one.
* Since your computer might struggle to process numerous 4k videos, it would help to create proxy files as early as possible so you can save your progress along the way.
* During filming, create and collect your favorite b-roll shots. These clips provide extra information or context to anyone watching your music video.
* Ensure you match the video to the beat and look out for areas where the performer sings along. We guarantee your fans will notice the slightest delay between the song and the performer in the video.
* Once the music video looks polished and synchronized, you can adjust brightness, contrast, and exposure and change the white balance.
* Lastly, you could begin or end the video with the artists' credits, such as their names or logo. Since it is a relevant piece of information, ensure this segment of the video grabs the viewers' attention.

## Conclusion

If you want your song to go viral, you ought to put in the work and make the video as good as the soundtrack. Nothing is as bad as a good song with a poorly executed video. Your fans will definitely criticize you for it, making the ratings go down.

Fortunately, the guidelines in this article will set you on the right path and help you make a polished-looking music video in no time.

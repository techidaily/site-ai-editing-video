Follow the step-by-step guide to merge videos using Photos App on Windows 10:

### Step 1: Lauch the Photos App

Type 'Photos' into your computer's search bar, then click on the program that appears.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-6.jpg)

### Step 2: Start a New Video Project

You want to start your video production after launching the Photos app. To do so, go to the top right corner of your screen and select New Video Project, which will take you to the editor mode.

The second part of this procedure is known by several titles in different versions of Windows 10's Photos app, such as creating a video with music, creating a film with text, and a new video project.

Launching the editor mode directly from the photo if you're using photos in your video project is also possible. In that case, consider the following:

* Open your file in the Photos app
* Select Edit & Create

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-7.jpg)

You can name the project by typing it in the name tab in the top left corner of your screen. Then, by clicking the pencil icon next to your project's name, you can alter your title at any moment.

The video editor in the Photos app won't allow you to upload files until you've given your project a title. When you try to add a file, a pop-up choice will display, and you may write in the project's name and then click OK or Create a Video to continue.

### Step 3: Import Files

To add files to your video project, go to the Project Library portion of your screen and click the + icon that you see in the top left corner.

## How to Add a Custom Transition to OBS

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

![add stinger obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-stinger-obs.jpg)

Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.

![name stinger transition obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/name-stinger-transition-obs.jpg)

Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.

![apply cut transition effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg)

Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.

![select transition point field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg)

Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.

![audio monitor output obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-monitor-output-obs.jpg)

Step7 Scroll down and click on Preview Transition button to check if the stinger transition is taking place as expected. You can adjust the transition point and other parameters to get it perfect.

Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.

**How to play .FLV files?**

To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that's not the case.

If you don't want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.

**Veed.io: (Online):**

If you want to edit FLV videos quickly and don't want to install any software then Veed.io can be a good choice for you. It is an online FLV video editor that can run on any browser and is compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, and even mobile phones. It is a quick and simple method to fulfill your basic video editing needs. It has some amazing and uniques features as compared to other basic video editors. It is a great platform to edit videos anywhere. You can start editing video on your PC and can continue it on your phone if you have to leave your workplace. But these features come at a price as its basic plan has the majority of the features but it leaves a watermark on the final video.

**Pricing:**

It has 3 different plans depending on your needs. The first one is the "Free Plan" which is almost useless for most users as it creates a watermark. The second one is the "Basic Plan" at 18$/month. While third is the "Pro Plan" at 30$/month which has some more features than the basic plan. You can purchase an annual plan to save up to 33%.

**Which Should I choose Free or Paid FLV Editor** **:**

 Are you confused to choose the FLV editor for you? Then look for the one that suits your other needs. Like if you want an editor only to crop or trim videos then save your money and go for a free video editor. But if you want some extra features to enhance your workflow or have some cash then go for paid software. For professionals, Power Director 365 or Filmora pro can be a good choice to invest your money in.

\~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:

**why is .flv format used?**

FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.

**How to play .FLV files?**

To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that's not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.

**Is .flv file easy to edit?**

FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don't worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.

**Can the .flv file be converted?**

If you don't want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.

**VLC Media Player:** Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It's quite easy to use.

**Flv vs Mp4 which is better?**

FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.

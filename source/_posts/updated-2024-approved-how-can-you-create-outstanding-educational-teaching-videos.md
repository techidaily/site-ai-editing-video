Step2 Once the video is open in Filmora, you will need to drag it to the timeline panel before you can start to edit it.

![drag video to timeline panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-03.png)

Step3 Click on the “Titles” tab at the top to open the text and title presets that you will need to add text to the document. Filmora offers more than 200 text effects to choose from. Just double-click on one of the presents to select it and then the preview window to see it in real-time.

![click on title tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-1.png)

Step4 If you like the preset that you have selected, place the cursor on the position in the timeline where you would like to add the text and then drag and drop the title track above the video in the timeline.

Step5 If you would like to change the duration of the text simply drag the edge of the timeline until you get the length that you desire. Filmora also allows you to edit and customize the text. To do that, double-click on the “Title” time frame to get some customization options.

Step6 Once you are happy with all the changes you have made, click on “Export” and choose an output format to save and export your video.

## Takeaway

Titles are a vital part of any video as they can be used to provide a preview of the content the audience can expect. Now you have a huge selection of pre-made video templates to make your video unique and you can easily edit them in Final Cut Pro or [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 5\. WMV VS. MP4: What's the Difference?

MP4 is far more popular than the WMV file format. The world is shifting on the internet; MP4 is widely used and loved online. On the other hand, WMV is popular with Windows users, along with DVD and Blu-ray collectors.

If we talk about the supported software for MP4 and WMV, MP4 has bigger support. WMV is supported by fewer video players and online video editing tools. On the contrary, MP4 is supported by all the video players available for both Windows and Mac users; along with that, every online tool also supports MP4 format for video editing.

Now the world demands quality. In terms of quality, MP4 has better quality than WMV. WMV has lost the battle of quality provision against WMV. MP4 is a larger file than WMV in terms of file size. It is less compressed than WMV format, but the compression gives WMV an advantage over MP4.

Having a compressed file format produces files of smaller size, which can be easily stored. Easy storage of video files makes WMV a better option in places where the quality of the video can be compromised.

### Bottom Line

After reading this article, we hope that you have increased your knowledge regarding the WMV file format. We talked about the pros and cons of the WMV format. Moreover, we also shared ways to edit a WMV video with the best video editor, Wondershare Filmora.

## Backup and Organize Your Tons of Footage in Minutes

Backing up your data is deemed significantly necessary among video editing communities. Files get corrupted easily. Having a backup drive can save your day and countless hours. You can back up your data any way you deem fit. However, it will do you right if you follow the advice of professionals.

The article is written explicitly after due consideration and suggestions from the professional video editor. You can follow the steps in it to make backup files. Let us start with very straightforward steps to help you understand the professional way of backing up and organizing your footage.

## Part 1\. Back Up Your Files

Backing up your files gives you peace of mind. If one file is lost, the whole project becomes vulnerable to failure. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure the protection of files. The best way to protect the files from any misfortune is to back them up.

Remember, there is no specific way to back up your files. Depending on the project's requirements, you can do that differently. The following steps will light up how you can back up your files.

##### Step1Back up your files in two different places

It is crucial to do that. If one backup drive corrupts, you have the second option. It gives you an opportunity to back up files.

* You can make two different external backup hard drives.

![back up your data on two different external drives](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-two-different-external-drive.jpg)

* You can also use your internal and external devices as two backup options.

![back up your data on an internal and external hard drive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-an-internal-and-external-hard-drive.jpg)

##### Step2Make specific folders for each purpose of the video

The next step is how you back up your files properly and safely. Make separate folders for the different formats you are importing in your drive. Always use the primary source to make a copy of your files.

Follow the steps below to understand how to back up your files in two drives.

* Create a folder in your drive.
* Name it. You can name it according to the given format. The choice is yours.

![format for naming your file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/format-for-naming-your-file.jpg)

* Your backup folder is created.
* Make new folders based on the files that are imported into the file. We are making two folders for the project, 01 Footage, and 02 Audio.  
  * 01 Footage is for the original footage.  
  * 02 Audio is for audio files provided by the music artist.

![make folders for different formats in the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/make-folders-for-different-formats-in-the-video.jpg)

##### Step3Repeat the same process in your second backup drive

* Make the same folders and sub-folders in your secondary backup drive.

![secondary storage device with same folder names](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/secondary-storage-device-with-same-folder-names.jpg)

##### Step4Transfer files to your primary and secondary folders

* Transfer files to folders and sub-folders in your first backup drive.
* Transfer files to folders and sub-folders in your secondary backup drive.

## Create True 3D Text Effects Using After Effects

Every video creator wants to make their videos eye-catching and get the message delivered to the viewers properly. If you have regular graphic elements and texts, your video is not going to be as engaging as expected. That is why video creators always try to include trending and attention-grabbing effects and animations in the video. There is no doubt that 3D animations for texts and titles look really amazing.

Different video editors have different 3D text animations and effects that you can apply to the text on your video and get instantly noticed by your viewers. You can apply 3D text animation on premium video editors like After Effects as well as apply 3D text effect online. We will illustrate how to create stunning 3D text animations with different video editors in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Create True 3D Text Effects using After Effects

After Effects is a premium video editor where you can create true 3D text effect from scratch. First of all, you need to create a new composition and add your text to your video. You have to enable 3D option for the text and add depth and lighting texture to get 3D effect. Therefore, you should first create 3D text effect and thereafter, animate 3D text as per your preference. Here are the steps to create 3D text After Effects easily.

Step1Launch After Effects and click on New Composition from Project section. Set the different parameters on Composition Settings and click on Ok button.

![new composition after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/new-composition-after-effects.jpg)

Step2Click on Type Text icon located at the top bar and type a text on the video. After typing the text, go to the Character panel to the right and adjust the style of the text.

![adjust text style after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adjust-text-style-after-effects.jpg)

Step3You have to enable 3D option for the text from the 3D icon on text layer. Under text layer, click on Transform and use X-Y-Z rotation options to rotate the text from 3D perspectives.

![add transform after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-transform-after-effects.jpg)

You have successfully created 3D text effect on After Effects. You will now illustrate how to animate the 3D text.

## Part 2\. Create 3D Camera Animation

You have prepared your text with 3D effect, and you can have multiple 3D texts on your video. It is time to animate those 3D texts so that the 3D effect becomes more prominent and the text instantly grabs attention. You do not have to create animation from scratch as there are 3D animation presets available. All you need to do is apply them to your 3D texts and they will start to animate automatically. Besides, you can create 3D camera animation to show the texts from different camera perspectives. Here are the steps to use 3d animated text generator on After Effects.

Step1Once you have created your 3D text effect, go to Effects & Presets panel.

Step2Go to Text> 3D Text and you will see all the different 3D animation presets that you can apply.

![preview 3d text animation presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/preview-3d-text-animation-presets.jpg)

Step3Drag and drop your desired 3D animation directly to 3D text layer.

Step4If you want camera animation on your 3D text, select the Camera layer you already created. Press C to get the Orbit tool to get the starting position of the 3D text. You can also use Dolly tool and Pan & Zoom tool for adjustment.

![get start position 3d text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-start-position-3d-text.jpg)

Step5Now add a keyframe on Position option from Transform option to mark the starting point of the animation. Similarly, add another keyframe where you want the animation to end.

![add keyframe position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-keyframe-position.jpg)

Step6Use the Orbit tool, Dolly tool and others to position 3D text as per how you want the animation to end.

## Top 5 Ways To Convert Hdr To Sdr Videos

## Transcode Video from HDR to SDR by Image Editing \[Samsung only\]

If you own the latest Samsung S22 phone, you are probably aware of its feature that allows you to record in an HDR10 view. But, what do you do if you want to send the video to someone whose phone is incompatible with HDR? The video will appear too bright and washed out.

By converting the video to SDR, you can send them the video without burning their retinas. This method to convert HDR videos to SDR is especially for Samsung Galaxy phones. The gallery app initially used to have a built-in option to do that, but it's not there anymore. While the original option is removed, you can still use the method below to convert an HDR video to SDR with just a few taps.

* To convert HDR10+ video to SDR on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you can directly proceed with it on your phone.
* Head to and open Gallery, choose your HDR10+ video and tap three dots in the bottom right corner.
* From the pop-up menu, select **Open in Video Player.**
* Once the video opens in the video player, click on another three dots in the top right corner.
* From there, tap on the **Editor**
* In the editor, tap again on three dots on the bottom right and now select Size and Format.
* From this menu, you can change the resolution of the video as well as its format. From the format drop-down, you can select SDR to convert your video to SDR.
* Make sure you do not tap on **Save;** instead, click on the three dots again and tap on Save as Copy. This will leave your original HDR video untouched and save a copy for the SDR video.

## Convert HDR 4K Video to SDR with YouTube \[Untested\]

HDR videos on Youtube show higher color dynamics and contrast ratios than an SDR video. Viewers with HDR-compatible devices will see ‘HDR’ after every video quality option in the video settings (1080p HDR).

However, the videos uploaded as HDR on youtube can be viewed on HDR unsupported devices too. This happens because youtube automatically converts all HDR videos to SDR to be viewed on non-HDR devices. Here is a brief introduction to the steps of converting HDR to SDR on Youtube:

* Record the metadata by exporting it from an HDR-supported application like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The metadata should be in a codec or container to be played by Youtube correctly.
* Grade your HDR properly as Rec. 2020 with PQ or HLG. Ensure the videos are graded correctly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are unsure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.
* rectly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are not sure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.

![color grading with wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-7.jpg)

* Once done, upload it on Youtube. If it detects HDR metadata during the upload, Youtube automatically produces an SDR conversion for non-HDR compatible devices.

![uploading the hdr video on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-8.jpg)

* Downloading the video from HDR unsupported devices will save an SDR video.

This method seems easy but has greater risks involved such as distortion of video if improper HDR grading is done.

## Get Real-time Video HDR to SDR Conversion by Video Content Providers

With gaming becoming almost a sport, online streaming has grown immensely popular. These streaming services allow you to stream in 4K HDR format. However, a significant downside of this is that many devices are still incompatible with HDR video.

The blog post describes how you can convert your live stream to SDR with different methods. You can give it a read if you are interested in that.

## Hot FAQs on How to Convert HDR to SDR

### 1\. Is SDR better than HDR?

SDR is Standard Dynamic Range, while HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR is the latest technology concerning quality, clear and detailed images. HDR is perfect for videos that require high contrast, shadows, and mixed light.

HDR is definitely better than SDR because the “High” definition takes everything to the next level. However, SDR is frequently used as most devices are not compatible with HDR.

### 2\. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?

Undoubtedly, HDR provides better image quality, colors, and clarity than SDR, but why is the file size smaller then? The answer is quite simple. HDR10 files are equipped with HVAC. HVAC is a very efficient file compressor that compresses the file while keeping its quality intact. SDR files are not compressed with SDR; hence the file size is much bigger.

### 3\. Why does HDR look washed out?

An HDR video might look too bright or washed out if your device is incompatible with HDR color space. Unlike the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S22, phones have a built-in HDR recording feature. However, older versions may not be able to enjoy the clarity and colors offered by an HDR recording. Hence when an HDR video is sent to someone with an older phone, it looks as if the video is washed out.

## Final Words

While HDR might be a superior color space, SDR is frequently used for video clips so maximum people can enjoy the video despite what their devices are compatible with. You can easily convert an HDR video to SDR using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or any other methods listed above.

An important point to note is that HDR videos converted to SDR might look a little off sometimes with darker shadows and sharpness. It might be a better idea to record in SDR rather than convert it to SDR later. However, converting is still a popular way to go with an HDR video; you will also have a beautiful high-quality video and an SDR copy.

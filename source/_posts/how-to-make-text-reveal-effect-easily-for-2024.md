## Part 2: Different Sony Cameras Offering S&Q Feature

Here is a brief review of these cameras for you to compare and select better:

### 1\. Sony A7 III

## Part 3: How to Slow Down Video in Sony Vegas Pro?

[Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/) stands amongst the top video editors who excel at creating slow motions. With its powerful speed manipulation, it can curate cinematic slo-mo effects. In addition, the tool offers an Optical Flow option for ultra-high-quality slomos. It offers a non-linear timeline editing, which means selective durations to apply this effect. Given below is the step-by-step guide to **Sony V** **egas** [**slow motion**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:**

##### Step 1

After launching the software, import the video and bring it to the timeline.

![import media in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-videos-with-sony-sq-7.jpg)

##### Step 2

Navigate towards the editing panel where the clip and audio track are showing. Place your cursor at the finishing line of the clip and stretch it throughout the timeline. This will add a slow-motion effect to your video.

![drag the import media in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-videos-with-sony-sq-8.jpg)

## Part 4: Wondershare Filmora: Comprehending the Best Alternative for Slowing Down Videos

All the above slow-motion solutions are adequate but not reliable. This is because shooting in **So** **ny** **S&** **Q mode** declines video quality upon export. In addition, the **Sony** **Vegas slow motion** subscription plans start at more than $500\. This seems expensive for someone who just started editing and is a beginner.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the perfect alternative to **S** **ony** **ZY** **E10 slow motion** and other devices. It offers an intuitive speed change interface at affordable prices. In addition, there is more than one method to alter its speed with optical flow. Moreover, the software offers extensive export settings to set video resolution.

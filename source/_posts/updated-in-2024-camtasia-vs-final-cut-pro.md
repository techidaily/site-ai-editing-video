Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.

**Step1: Create a new project & import media**

When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.

At the top menu bar, click _File > New > Project_ to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘_Use Automatic Settings’_.

At the top menu bar again, click _File > Import > Media_ to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.

After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press _‘Import Selected’_ and then close the media window.

**Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.**

The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.

In your browser, you can set the _‘In_ and _Out’_ points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.

After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the _'Trim tool’._ Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip's endings.

If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.

To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.

**Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects**

**Title and Texts**: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video's timeline. To access those titles you can press the _'Title and Generators’_ icon in the sidebar to open it.

The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘_Command + 4’_ and make the adjustments.

**Effects**: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘_Effects browser’_ icon to open it.

Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.

**Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.**

**Audio & Music:** At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.

To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word _'Jingle_' and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.

**Color correction**: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.

Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.

To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or _'Option + Cmd + B’_.

At the top menu bar again, click _File > Import > Media_ to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.

**Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.**

In your browser, you can set the _‘In_ and _Out’_ points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.

The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘_Command + 4’_ and make the adjustments.

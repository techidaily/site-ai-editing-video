## How to Record Video Streams With FFmpeg on Windows and Mac?

FFmpeg is an open-source video processing tool with many powerful features. Many of these features are exposed through FFmpeg’s command line interface but can also be accessed from the program’s Python bindings and its Qt GUI frontend, called QFFMpeg.

This article will explain using FFmpeg command line tools to record video streams on Windows and Mac computers with step-by-step examples and screenshots.

## Part 1\. What is FFmpeg?

FFmpeg stands for "FF Multi-Platform Executable" and was originally developed by Fabrice Bellard in the year 2000 as an extension of the MPlayer project. The sole purpose of the software command-line design is to provide a complete solution for users to record live streams (audio and/or video) from any type of device that supports either the RTSP or HTTP streaming protocols.

FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert, mix, and edit audio and video files. The software has over 250 input formats, which allows users to **record video streams** in any media format. The FFmpeg commands stream the video back after recording, convert it into MP4 or MKV file, and process incoming data on the fly, such as rtmpdump.

## Part 2\. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Windows?

The free FFmpeg command line tool is a great way to record a live internet stream and listen back to it later. If you have a Windows PC and want to record a video stream or screen using FFmpeg, our following step-by-step method will help you go through this process without facing many difficulties.

Step1 First, launch a browser of your choice on your Windows PC and head to the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) website. Hover over the Windows icon in the middle pane and select either the **gyan.dev** or **BTbn** build.

![downloading ffmpeg on windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-windows.png)

On the next screen, select the latest **Windows 64-bit** file from the list. Why? You need to use a computer compatible with the Windows 64-bit version. Next, download the ZIP file on your PC and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.

Step2 Locate the **ffmpeg.exe** file on the extracted file and copy it to a new folder on your computer hard drive (e.g., C:\\VideoRecorder).

![extracting ffmpeg files on windows pc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/extracting-ffmpeg-files-on-windows-pc.png)

Step3 In the next step, click the **Start** icon on your Windows dashboard and type **cmd** in the search box. Right-click on Command Prompt, select **“Run as Administrator,”** and launch the program.

![launching command prompt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/launching-command-prompt.png)

Now, write the command to select the FFmpeg directory. For example, cd **C:\\VideoRecorder**, and hit the **“Enter”** key.

Step4 To start recording the video stream, simply call FFmpeg and use the following command line. In this case, we are taking the example of capturing a YouTube video of “Running up that hill” from the top-rated TV show Stranger Things.

ffmpeg.exe -y -i <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao> runningup.mp4

Hit the “Enter” key, and the output of this command will be displayed on the Command Prompt interface.

The command options have the following meanings:

**\-y** allows automatic rewriting of existing files.

**\-i** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao> is the stream URL that FFmpeg will record. You can change it with any video stream URL.

**runningup.mp4** is the name of the output file.

### Tips: Automatically Recording Video Streams on Windows PC

If you want your computer to record a specific video stream time automatically, use the Windows Task Scheduler to create a Timer to stop the recording after a particular time is passed.

## Part 3\. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Mac?

You can use the Mac Terminal to record video streams via FFmpeg in the following way.

Step1 First, launch a browser on your Mac computer and head to the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) website. Hover over the **Apple** icon in the middle pane and select the macOS 64-bit static build option.

![downloading ffmpeg on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-mac.png)

Download the ZIP file on your Mac and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.

Step2 **Launch the terminal** on your Mac from the Apple menu, type the **“ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list\_devices true -i”** command to let the system know which device to record from, and hit the **Enter** key.

Step3 Next, designate the path where you want to save your video, e.g., **cd Path/to/my/videostream** and press **Enter**.

Step4 Type in the **“ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "1:1"-c:v libx264 -qp 0-preset ultrafast out.mp4"** command and hit **Enter** to start recording the video stream.

_**Special Features:**_

**#Silent Detection**

With silence detection, you can quickly and easily find the silent moments in your footage. It is great for finding those perfect moments of silence that can impact your film much.

**#Audio Ducking**

Audio Ducking is a feature in Filmora that automatically lowers the volume of an audio track when another audio track is getting played. It can help ensure that dialog is always audible, even when other sounds are playing in the background.

**#TTS and STT**

TTS and STT are two features in Filmora that you can use to create subtitles for your video.

TTS stands for text-to-speech, meaning you can create subtitles by typing in the text you want to speak in the video.

STT stands for speech-to-text, meaning you can create subtitles by recording your voice and having Filmora transcribe the text.

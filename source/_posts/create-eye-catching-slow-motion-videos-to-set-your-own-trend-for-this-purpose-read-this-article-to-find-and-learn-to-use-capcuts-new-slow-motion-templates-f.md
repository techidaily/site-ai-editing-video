## Synchronizing Videos Can Be Hectic, but Do You Wish to Know a Good Tool for This Purpose? This Article Will Discuss Wondershare Filmora, Which Is Perfect for This

Video quality and engagement are prone to impact badly if your audio is not synchronized with the video. This can happen because of technical issues or frame rate mismatches. In case you somehow get unsynchronized audio in the video, you need to use a reliable video editor to cater to this issue. To help you with this issue, this article will provide the best-in-class video editor named Wondershare Filmora.

The key features and the [smooth and sleek interface](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) show that you will have optimized audio synchronization with videos. Along with the auto beat sync feature, we will also discuss some online alternatives that will assist you in syncing audio while online.

## Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?

Audio and video synchronization is important for presenting a good quality viewing experience. Here are the main reasons you shouldn’t neglect this in your audio and video.

### Lip Sync and Narrative Flow

Synchronizing audio and video is crucial to maintaining the film's narrative flow. Well-synchronized audio and video offer a very smooth experience to the viewers. If the lips and dialogue flow are not well maintained, it can cause distraction in the storytelling. As a result, the real message won't be conveyed to the viewers.

### Viewer Engagement

Do you wish to ensure that your viewers pay full attention to your video and that your message is well conveyed? Your video quality and sound matter the most for the best experience. When the audio and video are well-synced, the viewers pay attention to the content. They are not distracted due to the bad quality of the video.

### Value of Quality Production

A high-quality video with perfect sound quality and proper syncing builds a good perception. If the video quality is bad or does not have proper sync, it can leave a bad impression.

## How to Turn On/Off Motion Blur in Minecraft?

Minecraft has been one of the most played games in the community. Known among hundreds of thousands of users, this game has been a prominent choice of many YouTube gamers. Streamers from all over the world are fond of playing this strategy game.

Although the game tentatively has a very basic graphic system, it has improved a lot with multiple features. Such is the addition of **Minecraft motion blur,** which has had mixed reviews throughout the community. For this article, we will be working on how to turn on/off the motion blur effect in Minecraft. The discussion covers everything related to the feature and its functionality.

![minecraft motion blur featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Motion Blur in Games?

Before you further discuss **Minecraft motion blur,** it might be vital for you to understand what the effect actually is. Motion blur effect has made a mark in video editing for presenting a realistic approach to videos.

For fast-moving objects, you can consider using the motion blur effect to display their swiftness. The use of the effect is consistently based on improving the user experience and showing objects in a realistic environment. The use of motion blur in games is based on providing a similar experience that was considered for videos.

As most games utilize stop-motion animation, it tends to lag at a lower frame rate. Motion blur enhances the gaming effects and smoothens them in a lower frame rate. This allows users to get a smooth game experience at a lower and adjustable frame rate. Motion blur in games has been added with the objective of smoothening the gameplay.

## Part 2: Does Minecraft Have Motion Blur?

Minecraft has provided the option of including the motion blur effect in its game. For a better visual experience, this effect has turned out to be quite beneficial. The existence of motion blur in Minecraft is equivalent to smoother gameplay, which is accomplished under a low frame rate. Rather than having screens with higher frame rates, you can get a low-end option.

All of this is essentially possible with the help of the motion blur effect. Even though Minecraft has a low-graphic display, it does not lag with motion blur. This is why the particular effect is recognized and acknowledged in the market. It has been discovered that Minecraft allows users to add motion blur from the graphic settings.

However, you must ensure that the device you are implementing has the tendency to control and manage the change and smoothness. Improper management of the motion blur under complex conditions will lead to multiple problems.

![motion blur in minecraft](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-2.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Get Motion Blur in Minecraft?

With an overview of the motion blur effect and what it is, we will now see how it can be obtained in the game. For the following steps, it can indeed work on the latest Minecraft versions, but it is precisely for versions 1.7.10 and 1.8.9.

Furthermore, we will focus on two different techniques to go along for getting motion blur in Minecraft. Let’s proceed to find out **how to get motion blur in Minecraft** by following these two methods:

### Method 1: Using PVP Clients

Step1 You can consider using any appropriate PVP client, such as [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) or [Badlion](https://www.badlion.net/), as they provide the appropriate mods to get motion blur in Minecraft. To start the process, you will have to install the PVP client on your computer from their official website.

![launch the lunar client](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-3.jpg)

Step2 Launch the client and proceed to select the version of Minecraft you are using and load the game. As you are within the game, move into the “Options” and look for “Video Settings.”

![access the video settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-4.jpg)

Step3 Look for the "Performance" options in the following settings and turn off "Fast Render" within the options. Once done, use the "Right Shift" button on your keyboard to access the Lunar Client menu. From there, you can set the intensity of motion blur from the available options.

![adjust the motion blur value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-5.jpg)

### Method 2: Use Forge

Step1 Another technique existing for getting motion blur within Minecraft is through [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/). While it is pretty common within the gaming community, it provides the option of using motion blur within the game. You must open their official website and download the version you wish to add to your game. In some cases, you might require installing Java on your computer.

![choose the forge version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-6.jpg)

Step2 Following this, open the Forge Installer to access the next screen. Select "Install Client" and continue to boot your Minecraft version where you wish to add motion blur.

![enable the install client option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-7.jpg)

Step3 You must access your Minecraft Launcher and look for "Forge" in the installations. Run the setup and quit the game. Download the motion blur mod to add to Minecraft. Look for the ".minecraft" folder in the "Local Disk (C:)" of your computer. Add the downloaded mod file to the "mods" folder.

![place motion blur in mods](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-8.jpg)

Step4 You must run Minecraft and type "/motionblur" in the chat box. You can set up the intensity of the motion blur from 1 to 10.

To prevent your gameplay from getting dismantled, you will have to know how to disable it. For that, we will look into a guide showing **how to turn off motion blur in Minecraft:**

![select the post-processing settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-11.jpg)

Step3 On the next screen, you will have to turn off the “Motion Blur” option and decrease the “Bloom Strength” to 0.1\. Click “Done” to save the settings.

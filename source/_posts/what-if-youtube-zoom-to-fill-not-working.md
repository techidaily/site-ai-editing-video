Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press **"I"** on the keyboard to set the **IN POINT**, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press **"O"** on the keyboard to set the **OUT POINT**.

**Note:** If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.

Step9 Then click **Export** and choose **Create Video**. Let's name it **freeze frame 1** and click on Export.

Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the **Alt+F** keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a **Cut**.

## Part 1: Top 10 Halloween-Themed Footage for Halloween Countdown Clock Video

Here we provide footage exclusively for horizontal videos, so that you can use them for your videos for YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, etc. If you just want some clips for TikTok, Ins story, or anything else, go ahead Halloween footage for vertical videos.

### 1\. [Fog Stones Halloween Dead](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/fog-stones-halloween-dead-43000147017.html)

Spooky graveyard with scary tombstones is another good way to go about it when you are looking for vacation countdown clock videos. The mixture of the turbulent and serene environment is enough to set the Halloween mood and even scare some folks.

Remember the scene from the movie “The Fog” and its famous dialogues: When the fog rolls in the terror begin! If you do not, take a look at a scene and judge for yourself if scary enough or not.

### 2\. [Scary Sadako ghost](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Scary-Sadako-ghost.html)

What’s better than the Sadako ghost 7-day video call threat on Halloween? Well, nothing! So, why not create a prank video for your friends and family, especially those afraid of Sadako? Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.

But you do not have to go through all that costume and scenery setup. Instead, you can use the video footage on any premium video and apply Sadako ghost via Green Screen.

Halloween is adored for its trick-or-treat, but what about the party? What will you serve? Cupcakes sound like a good idea. But how will you entice your guest with your Halloween cupcakes? Well, you can include the cupcakes in the invitation video. While you can find many Halloween creative and savory cupcake recipes on YouTube, you can use stock footage to have them in the video.

![cupcakes halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-3.jpg)

### 4\. [Skeleton breaking screen](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Skeleton-breaking-screen.html)

The broken screen is the classic prank suitable for any event and day. But simply using apps or replacing the wallpaper on your friend's or spouse's mobile doesn’t cut in this age and day. With new technology coming in, you have to get creative. Plus, it’s for Halloween, meaning dead skulls are a must.

![skeleton breaking screen filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-4.jpg)

### 5\. [Dark Monster Halloween Horror](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dark-monster-halloween-horror-43000084917.html)

Halloween house horror is another great backdrop for scaring your friends after a vacation countdown clock. You will find tons of videos on Halloween Horror houses on the internet. Look at how Jackie from Super Enthused (YouTube channel) gets scared while touring the 10 Halloween horror houses at the theme park. That was really scary, and this Halloween countdown effect can also help you do the same to your viewers.

![horror house filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-5.jpg)

Scary clowns against a kid’s window have been the long norm of scaring the small ones. No doubt, such pranks can scare anyone, not just kids. If you do not believe me, look at the reaction video from Infinite featuring scaring clowns’ pranks.

But how about dropping such a scary face bomb in a vacation countdown clock video? You can easily get your hands on creepy clowns’ portraits for videos via premium stock libraries like Filmora’s Filmstock.

![scary clown portrait filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-6.jpg)

### 7\. [A Family Wearing Handmade Halloween Mask At Home](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/a-family-wearing-handmade-halloween-mask-at-home-43000093665.html)

Another not-so-fancy, subtle, and understated appeal for the Halloween vacation countdown clock video is a family together with Halloween masks. Given everyone will be in their costumes, you can also consider distributing self-made masks for everyone. You can take ideas from any of the numerous videos about Halloween mask design ideas.

![face mask family filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-7.jpg)

What’s the simplest and most fitting footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock? Well, it is the scary pumpkins. Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it. The vibe from simple Halloween buckets stacked together is on the next level; if you do not believe me, look at Angie Bellemare’s Halloween Bucket ideas and creativity:

![halloween bucket stacked filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-8.jpg)

### 9\. [Carving Of Pumpkin For Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/carving-of-pumpkin-for-halloween-43000011941?af=&sualg=)

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video. It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:

![halloween bucket carving filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-9.jpg)

### 10\. [Dough Halloween Cookies Bakery Products](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dough-halloween-cookies-bakery-products-43000090890.html)

If Halloween is more about spending time with friends and family, a bunch of laughter, fun, and creating memories, then it cannot get better than focusing on the sweet stuff, like the dough used to cook the Halloween cookies. When you imagine the scenario of dough mixing for the Halloween countdown timer video, it does not sound like much! But they are cool-looking and set the perfect backdrop for a countdown timer video:

You can use such clips individually or mix them with other stock video footage mentioned here to create a perfect Halloween vacation countdown clock video clip.

![dough halloween cookies bakery product filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-10.jpg)

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. [Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/girl-blonde-portrait-halloween-43000089959.html)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. [An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/an-outdoor-table-with-halloween-theme-settings-43000100754.html)

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video? There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.

![mummy costume filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-14.jpg)

### 5\. [Stop Motion Of Halloween Candy](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/stop-motion-of-halloween-candy-43000095152.html)

Hosting a Halloween party for kids and in search of the perfect vertical footage for a Halloween vacation countdown clock video? It cannot get better than simply featuring a bunch of candy to lure the kids toward the countdown clock. When you look at this video and imagine using a clock for the countdown clock.

## Add Stylish Text to Videos

Create your style. Let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others – Anna Wintour. Adding Stylish Text to your video helps to communicate the clarity of the story's message, tone, and sentiment. But how much text on video is enough? This article will teach you how and when to add stylish text to your video and its importance.

## What is Stylish Text

In general, Stylish text is preset animations that you can use to the text in your video with just one click, adding an efficient plan to grab your viewers' attentiveness. From bold to essential, stylish text can help give your video a clear look while also increasing the accessibility of your videos. Text styles offer a monochrome highlight on your text and added movement to make your videos more engaging to the audience.

Most of the video editing software released offers different text style presets that you can use to accomplish the look you're aiming.

## What is the importance of Adding Stylish Text?

As a Youtuber, creating thumbnails is one of the essential aspects of getting the attention of your audience. A thumbnail is a small image inserted into a video that exemplifies larger content inside the video or article. Millions of videos are produced and uploaded on the Internet every single day, so it's essential for yours to stand out. Text on videos has several different added benefits as well. In this video, we'll give four reasons why you should start adding text to your videos.

### **1\. Content becomes easy to remember**

Viewer Retention (sometimes referred to as "Audience Retention") is the average percentage of a video that people watch. Videos with high Viewer Retention scores tend to sell more. Adding some Text/Title in your video is one of the critical factors to remember because the viewers get multiple cue points (example: audio and text on video) to confirm their understanding and retain the essence of the messaging.

### **2\. Make sense even without sound**

A lot of people watch videos on mute mode. A recent study indicates that 85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound. A lot of us consume videos while in transit and sometimes at work as well :).

Text is very expository for most of these videos since it'd help in building the proper context for the viewer.

### **3\. It Helps Summarize Key Points**

Some audiences are looking for a summary of the video in an instant to save more time. As Youtuber, it is very helpful if you will add Text/Titles as caption perse in a video. For example, one needs to remember 2-3 tips for driving. If the captions or text show up on the video when the driver talks about this and that, that's better!

### **4\. Aesthetics**

Some people don't care much about the graphics; they just go through the textual content. This is because texts are the major sources of information. Adding Styling Text/Titles can make a video engaging and attractive. The audience wants to see some color and action in the videos to grasp the storyboard easily.

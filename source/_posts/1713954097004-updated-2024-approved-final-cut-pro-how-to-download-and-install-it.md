## Easy Way to Inset Text in Video

Adding text to any video can serve to improve the quality of the video or emphasize a section of the video. But unlike adding text to an image, adding even simple text to a video can be quite difficult. But there are video editing tools that can significantly simplify this process.

Before we look at one of the best video editing tools that you can use to add text to your video, let’s first look at why adding text to your video may be important.

## Why Insert Titles to Videos?

Adding a title or any other kind of text to your video can be important for several reasons, including the following;

**1\. Content Becomes Memorable**

Adding text to the video can serve to make the whole content of the video or a section of the video more memorable. If there is a section of the content that you want your audience to remember, adding a colorful bit of text may make the content easier to grasp and therefore more memorable.

**2\. Call to Actions**

Any marketer understands the value of a well-positioned call to action and the best way to add a customized call to action is to add text to the video. Calls to action can help you sell products or get your audience to sign up for a service or event.

**3\. Brand Awareness**

Text that you add to the video can also be used to enhance brand awareness and visibility. These can be in the form of the company’s slogan and logos that can serve to remind your audience of the value of your brand and its trustworthiness.

**4\. Aesthetic Value**

When done correctly, titles and texts in videos can turn a bland ordinary-looking video into an aesthetically pleasing art piece that your audience will only be too happy to engage with. The more appealing your video is, the greater the chance that your target audience will be willing to engage with your brand and click on your calls to action.

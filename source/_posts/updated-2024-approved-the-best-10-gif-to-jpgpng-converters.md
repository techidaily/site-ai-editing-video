## Part 1: Backup Your Original Video

Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup. Making this a habit will save you a lot of time and work in the long term. How many copies of your data should you make? You should create at least three project duplicates in the best-case scenario. Also, make sure they're preserved in various formats and places—one on an SD card, another on a hard drive, or a USB drive.

## Part 1: Backup Your Original Video

Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup.

The fundamental elements of many other transitions are fades. Effective use of Fades is a crucial skill in your video editing repertoire since it is subtle to the point of practically being undetectable. A video transition called a "fade to black" causes a scene or clip to gradually conclude with a black backdrop. It dates back to the time when the stage curtains were drawn and the lights were dimmed during a theatrical performance. The stage therefore went completely black while the team behind hurriedly changed into new clothing and stage items for the following action.  

Those that seem to take place close together chronologically are edited together, while scenes that occur at separate periods or locales are faded out. These are recognizable features of the film. They alert us to the fact that the tale is moving to a later time or place, either thematically, chronologically, or geographically. In a practical sense, this is the time when the cast and crew switch out the set and clothes. But the fade-to-black marks the end of the scene in a symbolic and narrative sense.

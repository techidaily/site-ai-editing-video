## Track Mattes: The Ultimate Guide For After Effects

Are you wondering what **Track Mattes** is? In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.

For After Effects editors, **Track Mattes** can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.

In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about **Track Mattes**. We'll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.

1. [Alpha Matte](#part4-1)
2. [Alpha Inverted Matte](#part4-2)
3. [Luma Matte](#part4-3)
4. [Luma Inverted Matte](#part4-4)
5. [Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel](#part4-5)

## Part 1\. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?

A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a "hole" in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.

You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.

Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.

Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.

## Part 2\. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte

In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.

Here're some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:

1. A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.
2. A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.

## Part 3\. Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects

Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the **Transfer Control Pane** button on the bottom-left of the timeline.

![track matte in the timeline window of the after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/track-matter-in-the-timeline-window-of-the-after-effects.png)

If you are still unable to find the Track Matte option, press the **F1 key** or do the following steps in sequence:

1. Right-click on the area above your layers and select **"Columns."**
2. Scroll down and click the **"Modes"** option to enable it.

![finding the track matte option in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/finding-the-track-matte-option-in-after-effects.png)

1. **Track Matte mode, Preserve Underlying Transparency,** and **Blending Modes** will be available now.

Under Track Matte's drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma. We'll discuss these options in detail in the next section.

## Part 4\. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects

After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:

**Alpha:** This Track Matte type uses the layer's Alpha channel to determine the layer's opacity.

**Luma:** This Track Matte type uses the top layer's brightness to mask the bottom layer.

![the four track matte options in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png)

Let's find out the functions of each option one by one:

### Alpha Matte

Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.

### Alpha Inverted Matte

The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.

### Luma Matte

Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.

### Luma Inverted Matte

Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.

### Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel

When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.

Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.

![alpha channel in track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/alpha-channel-in-track-matte.png)

On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.

## How to Create Chroma Key Written Text Effects in Filmora

Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.

## Part 1\. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?

Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.

![chroma key text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png)

Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it's an easy way to make 3D motion videos.

To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:

## Part 2\. Filming Tips for Written Texts

To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.

### Tip 1\. A Pen and a White Paper

We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.

We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:

![purple color pen on white paper](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png)

It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it's more apparent during filming.

### Tip 2\. Different Color Paper

There are many chances that you don't have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don't need to worry because you can use different color papers too.

But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.

![different color paper with different markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don't use dull color pens with bright color paper.

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

### Tip 4\. Larger Size of Letters

As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

![the larger size of the written key text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-5.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.

After filming all the clips, you must edit those shots on the Filmora to get the chroma effect. Scroll more to get the step-by-step process!

## Part 3\. Editing the Chroma Key Text With Filmora

We need software that will give great setting choices and stock videos for a more professional look. For this, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will work more than a robot and give high-resolution results.

##### Step5 Color key out

To key out the specific color for changing its background, you have to perform the following actions:

* First, find the **Select color** option in the settings of the clip.
* Then click on the color dropper in front of the color tab.
* After that, pick the color dropper and move it on the video to select the color from the text.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure to select the color from the middle of the text for better key-out accuracy.

![color key out from the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-10.gif)

You have to adjust the size and thickness after selecting the key-out. For this, follow the next step!

##### Step6 Adjust the settings

To adjust the Chroma Key's settings, set the offset, tolerance, edge thickness, and edge feather. Increase or decrease according to your range and that suits you the best.

Then click on **Alpha Channel** to mark the tick in front of the option. It is due to that chroma key effects will be more clearly shown.

![adjust the chroma key settings in the filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-11.png)

Now, it's time to set the background after fixing all the settings of the chroma key effect. To perform this, scroll more to get to the next step.

##### Step7 Import background clips

You have to add an excellent motion background in the handwritten text video. For this, you must first import the background clip into the filmora. Then, click on **Import Media** and choose what you want from your PC.

![import background clip into the filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-12.png)

##### Step8 Add a background clip to the timeline

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

### Tip 4\. Larger Size of Letters

As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

**Note:** You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.

After filming all the clips, you must edit those shots on the Filmora to get the chroma effect. Scroll more to get the step-by-step process!

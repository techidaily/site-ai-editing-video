## How To Blur The Video Background in After Effects

While capturing a video, it may be possible that the background of the video looks dull or tedious. Or, unwanted people in the background are ruining the overall presentation.

Moreover, we will also highlight an alternative to Adobe After Effects for additional help.

## Part 1: What Do You Need To Blur Background in Videos?

There are many scenarios in which blurring the video background becomes necessary. In this part of the article, we will discuss some common scenarios in which people feel it is mandatory to blur the video background.

### 1\. To Put Focus on Subject

If you want to keep the spotlight on the main subject of the video, blurring the background becomes essential. By doing so, you can highlight and grab viewers' attention to the subject of your video.

So, if you are making a vlog in such places, you can blur the video background to avoid copyright strikes on social media platforms.

### 4\. Ensuring Privacy

If you are making a tutorial video while sitting at home, you may concern about the privacy of your family members or house. Thus, in such cases, blurring the video background can be a safe idea to ensure the privacy of your home.

## Part 2: How to Blur the Video Background in After Effects?

### Steps to Blur Background in Adobe After Effects

Adobe After Effects is an amazing tool for applying aesthetic visual effects to your videos. To make **background blur in After Effects** easily, check the following steps:

Step1 Open Adobe After Effects and upload the video clip you want to edit. Once done, double-click the video you have added to the timeline to select the clip you want to blur.

Step2 Now head to the ROTO brush displayed on top and click on it. The green circle can be used to select the part you would need. In comparison, the red circle can be used to highlight the part that you don’t need. To shift between these two colors, you can press the Alt key.

To blur the background in the video, search for “Gaussian Blur” in the effects tab. After applying this effect to the copied layer, increase the blur effect and wait for the calculations.

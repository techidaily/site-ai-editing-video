Until I continued to upload and others requested the video what they want to see on my channel.

## Part 3\. Tips to use green screen on Zoom video

Here are some important tips to use green screen on Zoom video for a better outcome.

Buy Large Green Screen - Since you are going to invest in buying green screen, you should buy a large green screen instead of buying two. Firstly, when you have one large green screen, you can set it up without any wrinkles or overlaps.

Secondly, a large green screen means greater surface area, and even when you slightly change the angle of your camera, your background will still have green screen instead of the exterior wall showing up and ruining virtual background effect.

Buy Green Screen Stand - Along with green screen, you should buy a sizeable green screen stand. A regular green screen stand contains two vertical supports at both ends and one horizontal support where you hand the green screen.

You can buy it according to the size of green screen you have bought. And you need to buy stand because you cannot fix the green screen on the wall properly. If you use any other means, there are going to be wrinkles and uneven virtual background effect.

Green Screen Quality - You can purchase any shade of green screen, but we recommend you opt for vibrant green color for a better outcome. Most importantly, the color should be even across the surface, and there should not be light and dark patches to dampen the virtual background effect and make it look unrealistic. That is why you should not compromise with quality.

Avoid Green Objects - You should not wear anything green. If your green screen has a lighter shade, you can wear deep color dresses and vice versa. Most importantly, you should not keep anything that is green while attending Zoom attending as it will disturb the green screen effect and it will look embarrassing. If you need to keep any green objects in your Zoom meetings, you should have blue screen instead of green screen.

Focus On Lighting - Lighting is extremely important when you want to use green screen. You should place the light so that it spreads evenly across the green screen. Otherwise, there are going to be light and dark patches, and the effect can get disturbed. Make sure you do not cast any shadow on the green screen by positioning the green screen accordingly.

Select A Proper Background - Last but not least, when you change your green screen to any virtual background photo or video, make sure you keep your audiences in mind. If you are attending a meeting, you should keep a professional-looking background. The background should not be distracting and match the theme of your meeting.

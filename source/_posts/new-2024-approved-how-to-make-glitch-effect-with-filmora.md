## How to Make Glitch Effect with Filmora

You don't need outdated VCRs or any other broken technology to produce glitch effects. Instead, you can use a video editing program for Mac and PCs, such as [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), to transform your videos into glitch-effect masterpieces. You can also use the glitch effects to provide striking shot transitions or opening titles. Keep reading this article on how to apply various glitch video effects in Filmora 11:

## Part 1: What is a Glitch Effect?

A glitch effect occurs when a section of your video temporarily changes look or "glitches" for a short while. Although transient glitches are typical, they can occasionally linger for a few seconds or more.

![what is a glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_2.jpg)

You can use a glitch effect to temporarily change the appearance of the image in the video to give the impression that a machine is processing it. Additionally, it gives your finished piece a fantastic, dreamlike aspect.

## Part 2: When Should you Apply a Glitch Effect?

A few years back, we had no choice but to watch glitchy movies on rusty VCR devices. Nowadays, retro video effects are very popular in TV movies and even games. You can use these effects in many ways, like making fake vintage footage or emulating a glitching computer.

Filmmakers frequently employ glitching in their videos to give the impression that a character has been affected by a technical abnormality, is having a flashback, or is being watched by someone else via a digital camera system. Something happens when the person or image flashes, often without their knowledge. In addition, you can apply the glitch effect to a composition to evoke a feeling of dramatic irony.

## Part 3: Tutorial to Chromatic Aberration Effect

Chromatic aberration refers to how old lenses tend to split colors. This effect is very common in Old media like VHS or LaserDisc.

## How to Edit Recorded Video

The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don't need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.

Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you're on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don't have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we've put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you'll need to know to make stunning films, even if you've never done it before. We'll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.

## **Part 1\. Edit Recorded Video in OBS**

OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It's open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.

**Step 1\. Download and Install OBS**

Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.

**Step 2\. Setup Screen Recording**

The window is divided into separate parts called "docks" when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you'll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.

![obs setup screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg)

You'll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).

**Step 3\. Customize the Recording Source**

You'll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select "Display Capture" by clicking the "+" icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click "OK". At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.

![obs customize the recording source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg)

**Step 4\. Start/Stop Recording**

You'll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you're ready to begin recording. When you're finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.

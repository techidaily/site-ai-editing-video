You must know where the magic happens before you go Spielberg on your videos. Upon launching the VN app, you'll see a range of editing tools. Look for an icon resembling a magic wand or palette – your gateway to the wonderful world of video filters.

Once a filter is applied, you'll notice sliders or dials – these are your video filter editor tools. Play around with them! You can adjust the filter's intensity, making it as subtle or dramatic as you like. Tweak the brightness, contrast, and saturation until your video looks like you envisioned.

## Part 2: Download External Filter Installation Package

**_Step 1: Locate the My Filters Feature_**

The VN app is awesome, but can you add even more flair to your videos with custom filters? Yup! These aren't just your regular video presets – they're unique styles you can download and add to your VN arsenal.

To begin, tap on the “My Filters” section within the app. If you're wondering where this is, it's usually nestled beside the built-in filter options, represented by a '+' or 'Add' icon. This personal space is ready to be filled with your downloaded filter goodies.

**_Step 2: Import the Downloaded VN Filter APK_**

Here comes the cool part! To get new custom filters:

5. Tap on **'Import'** and wait for the magic to happen. Your brand-new filter will now be housed in **“My Filters”**!

**_Step 2: Save the Filter Preset and Use It Directly Next Time_**

After importing your snazzy new filter, the next step is super easy. Simply apply it to your video, and if you love how it looks, save it as a preset. This way, the next time you're editing, you can head straight to **"My Filters**," find your favorite custom filter and slap it onto your video without a hitch. Talk about convenience!

![ready to use video templates for marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/a-guide-to-effective-video-marketing-in-2024-1.jpeg)

Launching a video marketing campaign requires considerable planning and preparation. Follow these best practices for video campaign success:

##### 1.Set Goals and Identify Your Audience

The aim of video marketing for small businesses or large businesses should be tied to business objectives, such as raising brand awareness, educating consumers, or driving conversions. First and foremost, define these goals.

Who are you trying to reach with video content? You need a clear picture of this. Collect insights about audiences with regard to demographics, interests, values, media habits, and existing brand impressions. With these insights, you can create unique content that appeals to your target viewers.

##### 2.Conduct Market Research

Research what kinds of videos connect with your audiences by accounting for competitors and non-competitors successfully using video. Identify videos with the most hits, shares, subscribers generated, and other metrics through channels like YouTube Analytics, Tubular Labs or SEMrush.

From the data, conclude common themes around video length, preferred formats for content, production methodologies, and so on, which should then serve to guide your own content.

##### 3.Craft a Compelling Story

Every great marketing video is a story. Draw a story plot with rising tension and emotion leading to resolution. The story's exposition, rising action, climax, and denouement can be outlined by famous storytelling frameworks.

Narratives that keep viewers engaged from beginning to end result in better videos. Early validation for your script ideas can be gathered through focus groups, social listening, surveys, and interviews with members of your target audience.

##### 4.Produce Video/Audio with Quality

Bring your story to life by investing in experienced video producers. Budgets may be wildly divergent, so always aim to achieve the best production quality.

Feature crisp, bright camerawork, professional editing, and transitions. Be sure to use intense music to underscore emotional peaks and simple but eye-catching visual effects where they make sense.

For audio, manage volumes between scenes at the same level; minimize background noise; have clear dialogue and smooth mixing. Good video and audio keep viewers glued to your content.

##### 5\. Select Suitable Video Platforms

Research where video marketing is most effective in your niche, and figure out which social platforms and media sites your target audiences use.

Being present on several different platforms is every strategy's dream. However, the real key is finding out where your audiences are most engaged and directing them there with video content tailored for the individual user experience by the platform.

##### 6.Implement a Strong Call-to-Action

The ending of every video narrative should take the viewer toward an action. Clicks to websites? Subscriptions to YouTube channels? Form fills? App downloads?

Your final message in your video clears CTA. Add supporting calls-to-action in the form of superimposed graphics, cards, or endscreens outside of the video to direct traffic beyond that medium and give more expression to the story.

##### 7.Track and Optimize Performance

After videos are posted, collect data on performance. Such indicators include view counts, average % viewed, changes in viewership over time, referral traffic, subscribers gained (added), conversion rates, and so on.

Feed analytics insights into an optimization road map. To inform new video projects targeting the same KPIs, look at higher versus lower-converting videos. Test repetition of the same content on different media platforms at various time intervals, with varying images of thumbnails and so forth, to improve metrics.

## Part 2: 3 Typical Types of Marketing Videos

![AI text to speech tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/a-guide-to-effective-video-marketing-in-2024-2.jpeg)

There are some video formats that particularly suit certain marketing objectives. Let's explore some of the most versatile, effective genres with real-world examples:

##### 1\. Explainer Videos

Knowing how to simplify and explain complex products, services, or concepts is precisely what Seasoned Explainers do. They use motion graphics, cartoons, live action--it's all good. They express it interestingly and help audiences understand value offerings they may be unfamiliar with.

##### 2\. Tutorial Videos

A good video tutorial leads audiences through a process one can use to employ the product, carry out the method, or develop the skill. Hands-on learning material meets user information needs, indirectly promoting brand owners of the know-how.

##### 3\. Behind-the-Scenes Content

These videos give audiences an insider’s perspective on making popular products. Getting a peek behind the curtain helps pique viewer curiosity while humanizing brands through interviews, b-roll footage, and more.

## Part 3: 6 Tips for making your video effective

![Video editor tool on Filmora V13](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/a-guide-to-effective-video-marketing-in-2024-3.jpeg)

Creating personalized video marketing strategies that effectively engage your target audience and achieve your marketing goals requires careful planning and execution. You need to grab viewer attention fast, communicate your key messages clearly, and provide strong calls to action.

The key is to keep it concise, optimize for sound-off viewing, build in interactivity, showcase user-generated content, partner with influencers, and more. Apply these best practices for getting your marketing videos noticed and acted upon:

##### 1.Keep It Concise

With a sea of content competing for viewer attention getting longer daily, shorter is better. Videos under 1 minute perform far better for driving clicks, conversions, completes, and shares. Test even 6-second bumper ads on YouTube and Facebook.

##### 2\. Capture Attention Early

You have seconds to hook audiences scrolling feeds non-stop. Dynamically edited intros with eye-catching colors, quick cuts, and dramatic questions/facts immediately grab interest versus slow fades or titles.

##### 3.Make Sound Optional

85% of videos are now watched without sound on mobile devices. While strong audio is still important for reeled-in viewers, ensure critical info is communicated visually as well.

##### 4.Incorporate Interactive Elements

Leverage platform tools like YouTube cards, info cards, links, hashtags, Q&As and more to keep audiences actively engaged with video content instead of passively viewing.

##### 5\. Spotlight User-Generated Content

User videos reviewing products or demonstrating branded tutorials often outperform corporate studio content now. Repurpose this UGC via reaction videos, contest highlights, and “best of” community compilations.

##### 6.Build Influencer Partnerships

Collaborations with influencers popular with your target demos lend video credibility. Support creators with gear, access, co-promotion, etc., in exchange for branded integration and affiliate sales.

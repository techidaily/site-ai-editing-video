## Part 2 **How to Get Animated Profile Picture without having Discord Nitro?**

Are you a Discord user, or are you get to create an account? If yes, you are familiar with discord nitro and all the advantages that come with it. And if you are not a user, you probably are confused about discord Nitro. Let's start with basic information on discord nitro and its use. Discord Nitro is the genre version of discord with multiple features, making it a worthy option. It enhances your experience with discord voice, text, video, and most importantly, creating profile pictures.

The Nitro version promotes **animated discord profile pics.** It is a great option but, what do you do when you can't afford it? Is it still possible to get **cool animated discord profile pics?** Yes. You can comfortably get a **profile discord GIF** without Discord Nitro. And you are lucky since this section will cover this necessary topic.

Of course, we have to thank content writer Ubaid Ullah for the article on how to get Discord GIF profile without nitro. After all, it is one of our reference points.

**Step 1:** Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don't have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.

**Step 2:** Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don't worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.

**●** Even without discord Nitro, you still have access to the **cool animated discord profile pics if you have a discord server.** Suppose you have an **animated discord profile**, and then we can only see one frame without discord nitro.

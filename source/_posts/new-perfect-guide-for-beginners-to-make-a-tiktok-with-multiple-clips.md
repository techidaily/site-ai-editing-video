## [Tutorial] How To Add Motion Blur in Blender?

Motion blur effect, as a terminology, holds great significance in multiple industrial uses. From filmmaking to basic photography, the motion blur effect is consumed as a reality-setting standard, which defines its significance. Many platforms are providing this effect to enhance the creativity of their users. Blender is also known among these software providing such services while designing animations.

We will target a comprehensive guide on **adding motion blur in Blender** using the right way. Therefore, if you seek the appropriate way of adding motion blur in Blender, the following description is for you.

## Part 1: What is Blender?

As we start our discussion, we will review [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a free and open-source software. Following this, we will continue realizing the benefits of adding motion blur through Blender:

### Introduction to Blender

For those unaware of Blender, it is an open-source, free creativity software. You can find it as the perfect designing platform for your 3D content. This software has made itself accessible to the market with ease. This has made it quite famous among professionals, and is recommended for its high-quality, feature-rich design.

If you are up for editing some videos through Blender, it offers a great course of features, including motion blur. This **Blender motion blur tutorial** intends to bring you a similar insight into this great software. This will help you know the procedure of executing such facets to perfection.

![blender interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-1.jpg)

### Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect

There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:

**· Perfect For Idolizing Speed**

The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.

**· Resolves Flickering**

Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.

**· Attenuates Real-Effect**

One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.

## Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?

As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on **how to add motion blur in Blender**:

Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the "Render Properties." Look to enable "Motion Blur" from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.

![enable the motion blur option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg)

Step2 Start by setting its "Position" in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use "Center on Frame." If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the "Shutter" value or vice versa.

![adjust the shutter value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg)

Step3 Following this, define the "Background Separation" according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the "Max Blur" pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.

![set background separation and max blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg)

Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.

## Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects

This polished effect can make your video's title stand out and is one of the best ways to create a stunning title for YouTube and Instagram clips. In this article, we will be looking at how to create the gold text using After Effects.

## Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects

Follow these steps to create a gold text effect in your After Effects video project;

Step1Start by creating an environment. To do that just right-click and choose “New Comp” and click “OK” to create one.

Step2Then we need to add fractal noise. To do that, click on “Effects and Presets” and type in “fractal” to choose “Fractal Noise.” You can double-click on it or drag it to the comp.

Step3Once this is done, you will need to do a little bit of housekeeping on the contrast and brightness. Increase the “Contrast” and reduce the “Brightness.”

Then go to the “Sub Settings” and reduce the “Sub Influence” down to zero.

Go to “Transform Option” and decrease the scale just a little bit. Then increase the “Scale Height” just a little.

Step4The next step is to add color to the scene. To do that, right-click on the layer and choose “New > Solid.” Select the gold color and click “OK.” Do the same with the second layer.

Step5Now you want to blend both colors by choosing a blending mode. Hold the “Shift” key and “hyphen” or “=” sign on the keyboard and choose “Overlay.”

Step6To make the color stronger, go to “Layer > Solid Settings” and choose a color.

Step7Go back to “Comp 3.” Right-click on it and select “New > Light” to add a new point of light.

Step8Go back to the project panel to click on “Comp 4” to add the environment. Right-click on the Comp 4 layer and make it an environment layer.

Step9In the options that appear, set “Appears in Reflections” to “Only” and you can then increase and decrease the color saturation until you have the desired result.

## Alternative Way to Create Video Gold

Adobe After Effects is a very good video editor, but one of the things that can make it inaccessible to many users is that it can be very difficult to use. Thankfully, there is another very effective video editor that you can use to create gold text that is much easier to use.

This is the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), one of the best video editors in the market. Before we look at how you can use Filmora to create the perfect gold metal texture on your text, let's first look at some of its main features;

* You can use Filmora to edit videos at a very high resolution including 4K videos
* It can be used to remove the background and noise from the video very easily
* You can edit both video and audio in the same project
* Up to 5 text tracks and 10 music tracks can be added to the same timeline and the same project
* It is very easy to use with a simple and intuitive user interface

Here's how to use Filmora to create a gold metal texture for your text;

##### Step1Install Wondershare Filmora on your Computer

Download the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) setup file to your computer and double-click on it to start installing the program to your computer.

Open the program once the installation is complete.

##### Step2Create a New Project

If you are starting from the beginning, you may need to create a new project.

To do that, click on “File > New Project” in the menu bar to start a new project.

If there was a project that you were already working on, click on “Open Project” on the main window and then click “File > Open Project” or “File > Open Recent” in the menu bar.

##### Step3Add A Title to the Timeline

To add a gold texture effect to a title on your video, we will first of all need to add a title to the project.

To do that, go click on the “Titles” tab at the top and drag one of the default titles to the timeline.

Once it is in the timeline, double-click on the title and edit it. Type in anything you want to appear in the title.

![add title to timeline gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-title-to-timeline-gold-effect.jpg)

Move the title to the second track in the timeline as you get ready to begin adding the colors.

##### Step4Start Adding Colors

Go to “Media” at the top and click on “Sample Colors.” Drag the black color image to the track directly below the title timeline.

##### Step5Add the Gold Effect

Delete everything from the timeline. Don't worry you took a photo of all the text layers and the effects added to each.

You will then need to find an image of a gold background. You can find these on any good background image site. Download a good clear image and upload it into Filmora.

Now drag and drop the gold background image to the second track in the timeline. Double click on the background image.

Select “Compositing” and then in the “Blending Mode” drop-down menu, choose “Darken.” Click OK.”

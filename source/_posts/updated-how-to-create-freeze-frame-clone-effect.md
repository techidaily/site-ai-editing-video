Are you a Premiere Pro user? Do you need to add the Premiere glitch transition to the video? Worry no more! Follow this subsection vividly. Would you?

Adobe Premiere Pro is a video editing software that has got you covered. You can enhance the speed of the video to tell your story better and share the vision.

If you want to perform a Premiere Pro VHS effect, allow us to walk you through the process. It is highly recommended that you follow the guide carefully to have desirable results. So, what are we waiting for? Time to start, right?

### Step 1: Importing the Targeted Video

To begin the process, open Adobe Premiere Pro on your system. Import the targeted footage and drag it to the timeline. After the video is added, head to the "Effects" panel on the left side of the interface.

![open effects tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-9.jpg)

### Step 2: Launching the VR Digital Glitch

![access effects control](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-10.jpg)

### Step 3: Changing the Distortion Control

Scroll down to find "Distortion" in the controls and expand it. The user is suggested to increase the color distortion to give an RGB effect to the footage. After that, you should reduce the distortion rate to 0 so that different artifacts can be eliminated effortlessly.

![customize distortion settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-11.jpg)

### Step 4: Changing the Noise Strength

![increase noise strength](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-12.jpg)

### Step 5: Animating the Glitch Effect

To animate the glitch, use the playhead on the top and drag it to the first position where the effect should start from. Hit the stopwatch located on the left of "Master Amplitude." It will create a keyframe. Alter the "Master Amplitude" to 0 as we do not want the clip to begin with a glitch.

![animate the glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-13.jpg)

### Step 6: Playing with the Playhead

Now, use your keyboard's right arrow to move the playhead three frames forward. After that, set the "Master Amplitude" to 100\. Again, move the playhead three frames forward and set the "Master Amplitude" to 0\. The animation is produced on the RGB color distortion.

![customize master amplitude settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-14.jpg)

### Step 7: Positioning the Video

Move back to the first keyframe and head to the top that shows "Scale" settings. Enhance the scale value so that the video position can be leveled. Click on the stopwatch next to "Position" to create a keyframe. Move the playhead one frame forward and adjust the position of the frame.

![change scale settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-15.jpg)

### Step 8: Final Process

Again, move the playhead to the next frame and click on the "Reset" shaped icon to reset the position of the video. Move another frame forward and reposition the video. You can do this multiple times to give a glitchy effect to the clip. There you go! It is all done.

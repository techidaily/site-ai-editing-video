## Creating Testimonial Videos For Health And Wellness Business Industry

It's not easy to get a testimonial video right. You need to know how to write one, find the right people to speak in it, and make sure your audience likes what they hear. But post-production can be even more challenging than getting everything else right: editing, adding effects, and music—it's enough to make your head spin!

Fortunately for you, we're here with our step-by-step guide on how to edit testimonial videos using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). So, sit tight because we're about to take you through each stage of this process from start to finish!

## Import Your Media Files to Filmora Video Editor

It includes your testimonial videos and video/photo materials. You can import your media files from the following sources:

* Medial Files
* Medial Folder
* From Camera or a Phone
* With Instant Cutter Tool
* With Auto Beat Sync

![import your media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/import-media-to-filmora.jpg)

To save time, it is best to prepare ahead of time all your videos materials before start editing your testimonial video. Save it in just one folder including your script guide, photos, and videos

## Select Your Preferred Project Aspect Ratio

Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of your video, which determines how it will look on different screens. There are several commonly used aspect ratios such as:

* Widescreen (16:9) – Recommended for Youtube and Facebook
* Instagram (1:1) – Recommended for Instagram and Facebook
* Portrait (9:16) – Recommended for Tiktok, Stories and Reels
* Standard (4:3) – Recommended for Facebook, LinkedInn and other

![select your project aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/filmora-project-aspect-ratio.jpg)

Being aware of the right ratio for each social media platform will help you to advertise correctly. It also affects how you edit your video. For example, if you choose a different aspect ratio than what was originally recorded by Filmora's camera tools, then some of your content may be cut off or stretched out in undesirable ways when viewed on certain devices (e.g., smartphones).

## Split Testimonial Video into Small Clips

![split testimonial video into small clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/split-testimonial-video-filmora.jpg)

When you're ready, drag your video testimonials to the Show Track then begin to use the “split” button to cut out parts of the video.

To split a video into smaller sections, start by cutting it down to the appropriate length by moving the playhead to the beginning position of the part you want to cut, clicking the Split icon (the scissors icon) on the toolbar, or clicking the Split button on the playhead.

From there, repeat this procedure until you've completed the whole narrative. You'll be left with numerous cut segments that you may either delete or rearrange. To remove a clip from your movie, choose Delete from the toolbar or right-click and select delete.

## Add Catchy Headlines and Text (Optional)

If desired, add catchy headlines/texts like "How to Eliminate Chronic Pain Forever”. You can do this by clicking Text button from toolbar located across top portion of screen (beside Transitions button).

![add catchy headlines and text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Adding a phrase or a short sentence is called “headline”. It would be nice to add one of them at your video, so that viewers can get an idea about what it's about before watching it in full. The text can be customized by using different font styles like bold, italic, underline etc., as well as its size and color.

## Input Subtitle

Subtitles are used to translate the spoken word into text. If you have a video that is in a language other than English, subtitles can be added so that viewers who do not speak the language can still understand what is being said. Subtitles are also useful if you want to add subtitles for educational purposes, such as teaching students how to pronounce certain words and phrases.

![input subtitle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/input-subtitle-filmora.jpg)

## Apply Transitions to Your Testimonial Video

You can add fade-in transitions to clips, as well as fade-out transitions.

To add a fade-in transition: Click on the first clip and select "Effects." Then, click "Transition." Choose a transition from the category of “Fades” and then apply it to the first clip by clicking on its thumbnail image.

To add a fade-out transition: Click on the second clip and select “Effects.” Then, click “Transition.” Choose a transition from the category of “Fades” and then apply it to the second clip by clicking on its thumbnail image.

Feel free also to use other transitions as you want, but be careful not to use an overly extreme one.

![apply transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-transition-filmora.jpg)

## Add Background Music to Testimonial Video

You may choose from a wide range of music in the audio library. It's available both online and offline.

You can also easily add background music from your computer by going to the "Media" menu and then selecting the import option. Make sure to use a non-copyright music so that you don't run into any copyright problems when you post your video. There are several no copyright tracks on Youtube; simply search for no copyright background music or get it from other sites that provide a free-royalty background music.

![add background music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-music-test-video.jpg)

## Add a Logo/Watermark

To add a logo or watermark to your video, follow these steps:

* Import your Business Logo to the Media Folder.
* Then drag it into the Show Track area.
* Resize it to the ideal dimensions, then position it in the correct location in your video. It's preferable to place it at the top or button section of the video.

You may also add your company's logo at the end of the video as a fade-out transition.

![add business logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

By adding a logo or watermark to your video, you can make it harder for people to illegally distribute and share your video without permission. It helps also to promote your brand or business. When viewers see your logo or watermark throughout the video, they will be more likely to remember who made the video and where they can find more information about your company or products.

## Insert Thumbnail

A video thumbnail is an image that represents your video to viewers. It should be eye-catching, but not so much that it's distracting. The right video thumbnail can help you increase views and engagement on your content.

Place the thumbnail at the beginning of the video, and make sure it's catchy! Your viewers won't have time to look at it in detail, but they will glance at it in passing. Make sure to include relevant text and images that can hook your audience and keep them watching!

![insert thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/insert-subnail-filmora.jpg)

After completing the editing process, you can export your testimonial video in a variety of formats. To do this, click on the "Export" button in the upper right-hand corner of Wondershare Filmora.

Recommended Export Quality

* Resolution: 720 or 1080
* Frame rate 30 fps

Select your preferred file format and destination for storage.

## Hot FAQs on Converting Videos for WhatsApp

### 1\. How can I send a 10-minute video on WhatsApp?

Users can directly send videos with 10-minute-length via WhatsApp if the file size is 16 MB or lower. Otherwise, you can compress the file using a **video converter for WhatsApp.** Alternatively, you can upload your file into your Cloud account and copy the link to send.

### 2\. How to convert YouTube videos to WhatsApp?

You can directly copy the YouTube-based video link below the Share button on its page, paste it into the chat, and send it. Alternatively, you can use a reliable converter tool to download YouTube videos in one of the supported video formats (e.g., MP4). Then, share them via WhatsApp chat.

### 3\. How to Send Videos on WhatsApp Without Compressing?

WhatsApp compresses the video files automatically when users insert and send them via the Gallery icon within chats. However, you can avoid reducing video quality or compressing them if you send it by clicking on the Document icon > My Media Files/whichever folder the file is in.

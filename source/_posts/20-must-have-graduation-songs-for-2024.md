## Part 4: How to Use Google Photos to Edit Video?

Google Photos doesn’t only work as a **Google video stabilizer** app but it also enables you to edit your media clips much more professionally. Some post-production tasks that you can perform while using Google Photos include:

**1\. Trimming**

The trimming handles can be seen when you are on the ‘Video’ section after tapping ‘Edit’ in Google Photos after opening the video. You can drag these handles inwards to get rid of the unwanted starting and ending parts of a clip.

![google photos trim video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-trim-video.jpg)

**2\. Cropping**

The ‘Crop’ section enables you to crop the videos in a particular aspect ratio that can be selected from the available list, or drag the handles manually to get custom results.

![google photos crop video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-photos-crop-video.jpg)

**3\. Rotating**

The ‘Crop’ section also has an option to rotate the video. Each time you tap the ‘Rotate’ icon, the screen rotates 90o in the counterclockwise direction.

![rotate video google photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rotate-video-google-photos.jpg)

**4\. Color Correction**

![filters google photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filters-google-photos.jpg)

**6\. Annotations**

The ‘Markup’ section enables you to annotate the video. You can either use the ‘Pen’ tool or ‘Highlighter’ to write text on the video or give the screen a different shade respectively.

![video markup google photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-markup-google-photos.jpg)

Depending on the type of modifications you want in your video, you can use Google Photos to get the job done easily and quickly.

**Conclusion**

Google video stabilizer is a built-in tool in Google Photos. Google Photos can be obtained from Play Store or App Store for your Android or iOS smart devices respectively.

03 [How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos Online?](#part3)

04 [How to Use Google Photos to Edit Video?](#part4)

## Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?

Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.

The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if/when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.

**1\. History and Current Policies**

Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.

**2\. Accessibility**

Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.

**3\. Deletion**

The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.

## Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?

Google Photos is available for both Android and iPhone smartphones, and as explained earlier, the app can be downloaded from Play Store and App Store respectively. Using the built-in **Google stabilizer video** editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.

You can learn how to work with **Google video stabilizer** to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:

**Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos**

Download and install Google Photos on your smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations). Launch the app, tap **Library** from the bottom-right corner of the interface, and tap to open the source video that you want to stabilize with **Google video stabilizer**.

![open video to stabilize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-video-to-stabilize.jpg)

**Step 2: Stabilize the Video**

After the video opens in the app and the playback begins, tap **Edit** from the bottom. On the next screen, ensure that the **Video** section is selected. Tap the **Stabilize** icon from the lower-left area of the window, and wait while **Google Photos stabilize video**.

![stabilize video with google photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stabilize-video-with-google-photos.jpg)

**Step 3: Save the Video**

Once the stabilization process is complete, click **Save copy** from the bottom-right corner to save the modified video as a separate copy, thus leaving the original instance intact.

![save stabilized video in google photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-stabilized-video-in-google-photos.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos Online?

Unfortunately, Google Photos doesn’t have many editing options when accessed via a web browser, and therefore, at the time of this writing, you cannot stabilize a video with the tool’s web interface. But if you are using a Windows or Mac computer, you can try some [free online video stabilization software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or use [Wondershare Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to stabilize video with one click.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Wondershare Filmora video editor is available for Windows and Mac platforms, and gives a tough competition to other industry-standard video editing applications like Final Cut Pro X and Adobe Premiere Pro, etc. You can learn how to stabilize a clip with Filmora instead of using **Google stabilizer video** editor by following the step-by-step instructions that are explained below:

**Step 1: Add the Source Video to the Timeline**

After downloading and installing Wondershare Filmora on your Mac or Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), launch the program, and click the **New Project** tile from the first screen that appears.

![filmora start screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-start-screen.jpg)

When on the main interface, ensure that **Media** is selected from the standard toolbar at the top, and click anywhere inside the **Media** window that is present at the upper-left corner. Next, locate, select, and import the source video from your PC that you want to stabilize.

![media library interface filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-library-interface-filmora.jpg)

Now, drag and drop the video to the timeline, or hover the mouse over the clip’s thumbnail in the **Media** window, click the **+** icon from the bottom-right area. Click the button under the **Match to Media** or **Keep Project Settings** label when the confirmation box comes up to add the film to the Timeline using the preferences that you selected.

![import video to stabilize timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-to-stabilize-timeline.jpg)

**Step 2: Stabilize the Video**

Double click the video in the timeline, and then enable the **Stabilization** category under video editing pane. Wait while Filmora video editor stabilizes the video without **Google video stabilizer**. Click **OK** when done.

![enable stabilize video filmora video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-stabilize-video-filmora-video-editor.jpg)

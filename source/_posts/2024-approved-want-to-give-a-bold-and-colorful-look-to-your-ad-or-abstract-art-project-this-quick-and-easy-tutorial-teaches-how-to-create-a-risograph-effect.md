## Want to Give a Bold and Colorful Look to Your Ad or Abstract Art Project? This Quick and Easy Tutorial Teaches How to Create a Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Risograph printing is a digital printing process that combines the best features of offset and screen printing used by many small print shops and design studios to provide trendy vibes and a classic look to the images.

If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you **create a risograph effect in Photoshop** quickly!

Without further delay, let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial!

## What Is Risograph Effect?

Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop [in the later part of this article](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.

Risograph was created in **1986** by a Japanese company called **Riso Kagaku Corporation.** It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.

The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph's unique charm and distinct look.

The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.

## How To Use Photoshop To Create Risograph Effect

The tutorial will be divided into three parts to help you master the risograph effect-creating skills to give your design project a distinct look.

Firstly, we will focus on how to use Photoshop in the following way to create the primary risograph effect.

### How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Step1 Launch [**Adobe Photoshop**](https://www.adobe.com/) on your laptop/desktop (For this tutorial, we are using Photoshop CC 2021). Click **“Create New,”** select the document size, and click **“Create.”** Now set a paper-like textured layer on the canvas. Click **“Ctrl + Shift + N,”** and in the new layer window, set the mode to **“Multiply.”** Click **“OK.”** to confirm your action.

![adding new layer to create risograph effect in photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-new-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step2 Next, press **“Ctrl+Shift+E”** to combine your layers and select the **“Edit”** option from the top toolbar. Scroll down and select **“Define Pattern.”** Set the pattern name and click **“OK.”**

![select edit option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/defining-pattern-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Click **"Layer"** from the toolbar and choose **"New Fill Layer"> "Pattern."** Next, select your new pattern layer and click **"OK"** to get a grid layer.

![choose new fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-grid-pattern-to-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step3 Let's place an object/subject onto our canvas. Set the issue to "**Multiply**," right-click on it and choose "**Convert to Smart Object**."

![choose convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-main-object-to-smart-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step4 To add a Gradient Map Layer, click **“Layer,”** scroll down and click **“New Adjustment Layer.”** Select **“Gradient Map…”** from the drop-down menu and click **“OK”** to confirm.

![click layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/selecting-gradient-map-from-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Use the **“Properties”** panel and select the **“gradient”** colors. Here we’ve chosen shades of **“White”** and **“Red.”** Click **“OK”** to apply.

![select the gradient color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-gradient-map-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step5 For the image to have less contrast, click **“Image”** in the top toolbar and click **“Adjustments.”** Select **“Levels…”** from the menu. Now, set the black output to **73.**

![click image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-adjustment-level-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Finally, click **“Filter”** and open the **“Filter Gallery.”** Select **“Sketch” > “Torn Edge,”** set Image balance to **30,** smoothness, and contrast to **15, 15** respectively. Click **“OK”** to apply the changes.

![click filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-filter-gallery-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

### How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect

After creating an image with the risograph effect, how to make it more visually vertical? At this time, the dual-tone impact will help us have a more delicate picture.

The dual-tone effect is a technique in the risograph effect that combines two or more overlapping images to give a more vibrant look to the final project or emphasize the critical concept, information, or idea.

To create a dual-tone risograph effect in Photoshop, do the following steps.

Step1 To create a dual-tone risograph effect, add another subject to the canvas and set the blending mode to **Multiply.** Also, change its opacity to blend the two issues well. Make sure to turn the subject to **Smart Object** by right-clicking on the object's layer and selecting **"Convert to Smart Object."** Adjust the position of the subject on the previous one.

![add another subject to the canvas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-subject-to-smart-object-in-photoshop-to-create-risograph-effect.png)

Step2 Select the layer of the new subject and click **“Layer”** Click **“New Adjustment Layer”** and select **“Gradient Map…”** from the drop-down menu.

Open the Gradient Editor and set the gradient colors of the new subject. Click **“OK”** to confirm. Click **“Image”** and choose **“Adjustments”** from the drop-down menu. Select **“Levels”** and set the **Black Output** to **73.**

Step3 Click **“Filter”** and open **“Filter Gallery.”** Navigate to **“Swatches” > “Torn Edge”** and set the **Image Balance, Smoothness, and Contrast** to **30, 15, and 15,** respectively, if you want to smooth down the subject.

Finally, your dual-tone effect is created in Photoshop!

### How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes

In this part, let’s see how to use the layer modes to add another subject to the canvas and blend it with the previous ones.

Step1 Place the new subject on the canvas and set the layer mode to **Multiply** by pressing the **“Ctrl + Shift + N”** and selecting **“Multiply”** from the drop-down menu in the new pop-up window. Click **“Ok”** to apply your changes.

To adjust the size of the object, click **“Edit”** from the top toolbar, and select **“Transform.”** From the drop-down menu, select **“Scale.”** Use the handles to make the object smaller or larger.

Step2 Click the **“Move”** icon from the left menu and drag the object to set its position. Now, copy and clip the **Gradient mode** from the main subject to the new one.

Step3 Apply the **Level** and **Filter Galler** to the new object (Same settings as the main subject). That’s it. You’ve successfully blended images using the layer mode.

## How To Use Speed Ramping to Create an Intense Action Footage

Are you tired of using the same old way to edit your montages? Or do you want to learn to be more professional in your creativity? Don't worry. We got you.

Here you will learn how to take your videos to the next level using speed ramping with a professional video editor- Wondershare Filmora. Moreover, you will get to know two ways to add the effect.

1. Using speed ramping effect and glitch effects.
2. Using the standard speed settings.

These effects can work well for any action sports or dance video. Let's check out about speed ramping effect and ways to add it.

## Part 1\. What is speed ramping?

You've probably seen speed ramping used in suspenseful moments of a basketball video before, like a ball bouncing on the rim or a long buzzer-beating shot.

![cinematic shots of a basketball player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-1.gif)

With speed ramping, we can slow down our most exciting moments to show our audience. And then speed it up again to keep pace with the music or action. So it will give you a smooth transition effect.

## Part 2\. How to enhance action videos with the speed ramping effect?

For example, we'll create an intense basketball video with speed ramping and glitch effects in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Then, to show you how to show off your filming, editing, and basketball skills.

##### Step1 Shot the footage

To edit a montage, you must first capture it correctly. For our example footage, we want to ensure we have set our camera to a higher frame rate for filming this type of video since we're going to use slow motion.

![shot footage from a higher angels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-2.jpg)

**How to capture the best footage?**

You can shoot handheld with a camera or a mobile phone because it allows you to move around your talent and catch some movements and action while giving a shaky camera effect for added suspense. To make evenly balanced videos, you can use a gimbal stabilizer. Here are some tips to get better shots.

* Change camera angles. Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.
* Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.
* Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.
* Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.

Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage. Finally, we will dive into edit tutorials on speed ramping and glitch effects separately for better understanding.

##### Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora

There are two ways to achieve the speed ramping effect. One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.

**Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora**

The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let's start by opening Filmora.

1\. Import media

First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.

![library in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg)

2\. Apply the speed ramping feature

To apply the speed ramping feature, **right-click** on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose **speed ramping** to open the settings window.

![add speed ramping option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-4.jpg)

You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.

![speed templates on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-5.jpg)

The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.

![adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-6.gif)

Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.

After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.

**Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora**

Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.

1\. You can **drag** the video from your library to the timeline. While in the **timeline**, double-click to open the speed menu. Then choose the starting speed you want your video to be with the speed slider.

![uniform speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-7.jpg)

2\. Next, move your playhead to the **point of the video** you want to slow down the speed. Here we will cut and then double-click that clip to open the speed menu again. Change the pace with the speed slider again

![split adjusting the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-8.gif)

Following the above steps, a speed ramping style effect can be created without using the premium feature. Stealthy, isn't it?

##### Step3 Add some intensity to shots with the BCC glitch effect

We will use Boris FX BCC glitch to add some intensity to our video. It is a plug-in built-in Filmora and gives a feeling of chaos to match the action in the video. To apply the BCC glitch effect to the video.

* Click on the effects options in the top bar. For example, a window on the left side showing you the option Boris FX will have a sub-option BCC stylize. Click on it.
* Drag the effect above the place you want it in the timeline.
* Double-click the effect to open its settings.
* A drop-down menu at the top of the screen has tons of glitch presets to try out.
* We are going to scroll down and select shake with motion blur. This preset will use the exact look we want for our basketball video to make the speed ramping more intense.

![present a drop-down menu and reduce the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-9.gif)

* You can change the settings around after choosing a preset. For example, let's turn up the glitch intensity to have our glitch a little more extreme. Moving further, we can change the glitch duration to our specific needs.

Now we can watch our video to see our glitch with the motion blur effect. Isn't it crazy to make a cinematic video by yourself? The speed ramping feature and glitch effects can bring any sports video to the next level.

If you arent satisfied, you can select a record to re-record your audio or click OK if you are satisfied.

To place the audio at your desired location in the slide, select and drag the audio icon to where you want it. If you're going to use numerous audio per slide, it is better to put the voice icon in the same place on the slide to be easily discoverable.

Note that you must enable a microphone on your device to start recording audio.

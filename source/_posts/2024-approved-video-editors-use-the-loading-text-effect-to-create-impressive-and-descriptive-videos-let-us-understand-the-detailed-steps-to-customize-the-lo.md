5. Start by dropping the red color on track 2 and keep it for 2 seconds duration.
6. Now double-click on the red color and change the "Blending Mode" to multiply.
7. Put the playhead at 14 seconds and add a blank keyframe at the 15th
8. Now put the playhead at the 15 seconds at the 10th frame. Here, define the x-axis position by dragging it from the left to right out of the loading text.

Visit the home website of the SmartSHOW software application to make a free download of the program in your preferred Windows device, followed by installing and launching the same.

**Step 2: Begin Crafting the Presentation**

A successful launch of the SmartSHOW program guides you to its editor workspace. You can start working on your slideshow here with importing the required media files from your system and adding them to the software’s timeline, using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method.

Once you have all the files, consider creating a wonderful collage by selecting a premade template from the editor’s library according to your specific presentation theme and adding the media files within the same to initiate an automatic collage creation.

Music is certainly an important element of your slideshow and you can use the same to complement your presentation by hitting the ‘Music’ tab to either select a matching audio track from the program’s inbuilt sounds library, or adding one of your favorites from your device’s gallery. You can further, include voice comments to expressively share some specific details about the presentation with your audience.

**Step 3: Include Titles and Effects**

To add more spark to the slideshow, try hand at experimenting with the diversity of effects, by choosing from over 350 different styles of animations and transitions, dynamic 3 D effects and soft gradients, while using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method to include your choices within the presentation.

You can also add suitable title clips to the slideshow to signify the occasion or theme of your slideshow. All you need to do is, select a suitable title clip from the available ones, give it a name and drag it to the editor timeline to include the same at the desired place in your presentation. Try using the feature to add rolling credits and names of event participants in your work. When you are ready with everything, tap ‘Play’ to watch a preview of your creation.

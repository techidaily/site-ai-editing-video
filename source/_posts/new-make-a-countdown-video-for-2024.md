## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

![create new text countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-new-text-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.

## How to Make a Gaming Montage

You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you'll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.

Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It's much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.

With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1) Decide Your Montage Story/Type

Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.

Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.

### 2) Record Your Gameplay Footage

The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.

That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you'll capture the moment after interesting things occur.

Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.

Once you've all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer. This program allows you to edit your video clips and add cool effects that will make viewers keep watching.

### 3) Import You Videos to Media Library

You only have to import the videos to Filmora's media library and then drag and drop them into the timeline, where you can start making the edits.

By right-clicking on the clip in your timeline, you'll see the options to zoom, speed, change, split, or trim your videos. You can also add sound effects by going to the Audio Tab.

### 4) Choose Background Music for Your Montage

Music will help make your gaming montage engaging. Make sure you use a license-free track if you plan to post it on social media.

Using copyrighted music tracks and uploading the video on social media platforms can lead to video strikes. Luckily, Filmora has loads of non-copyrighted music tracks.

Navigate to Stock Media, where you'll find non-copyrighted music on Pixabay, and choose the one you prefer.

## Useful Tips for Making a Gaming Montage

Making gaming montages can help you build a large online community if you do the right thing. When making a gaming montage, there are a few tips that you should keep in mind. They include:

### 1\. Apply Velocity Effects

Adding velocity effects to your montage will help get the attention of viewers. You can couple the transition between scenes with a speed ramping effect.

Include slow motion where there is a gunshot or other big gaming moment. You can then speed up things to quickly move into another scene. You can create these velocity effects in Filmora and make it smooth.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Avoid Game Loading Scenes

Do not include game loading scenes or any unnecessary clips in the gaming montage. Your audience does not have the time to wait for the scenes to load because they want to see action fast.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Sync Gunshot with Music Beat

Try to match gunshot sounds with beats and rhythms in shooter video games. The beats of the music and the soothing sync of gunshots will catch viewers' attention and your video will become popular among gamers.

### 4\. Add Creative Transitions

You can spice up your gaming montage by adding transitions, especially when you have loads of clips for the montage. But avoid overusing it, as you could confuse your audience with a range of dazzling and glaring transitions.

### 5\. Color Grade the Video for the Mood

Use color grading to your advantage, as it can set the mood of your viewers. You can decide to make some scenes black and white to catch the viewers’ attention.

### 6\. Add Video Vignettes for Special Occasions

You can add dark edges around the corners of your video to highlight action or create a certain mood. For gameplay based on a story, use vignetting to add a sense of nostalgia or as a flashback that shows viewers the past.

You can use Filmora to apply the vignetting effect by heading to Advanced Color Tuning, then clicking the Vignette option. You can then add the vignette effect to the video. Additionally, you can adjust the vignette's exposure, feather, roundness, size, and highlights.

## Best Gaming Montage for Studying

Here are three gaming montages that are good for studying.

### 1\. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

Uploaded by DemixB, the Call of Duty Game Montage uses Jacques Offenbach's Can Can Music track. It's a happy song that has a tempo of 81 BPM. The track has average danceable energy, and it's somewhat danceable.

DemixB set the gunshot in the montage video to the music tune. The track builds up to the climax when the gunshot echoes with the attention-grabbing orchestral explosions.

![Best Gaming Montage Example - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-4.png)

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

### 2\. ShutteR's Gaming Montage

In the gaming montage uploaded by ShutteR on his YouTube channel, he used velocity effects to enhance the video. You'll see that the transition in each scene is paired with adrenaline-pumping, speed-ramping effects.

ShutteR used a slow-motion to highlight action in each scene, then speeds up again when he wants to fast out into the next scene.; this makes the video more engaging to keep viewers glued to their screens.

### 3\. NEVERMORE \[CS: GO\]

NEVERMORE \[CS: GO\] was uploaded by Fuze on his YouTube channel, and it has creative gameplay. The gaming montage is based on a story. He did the project with Apel, an artist who designed the Fever Dream series skins in the video.

The basic idea of this gaming montage was that the main game character is a corrupted policeman with purple glowing eyes because he's not human.

When the edits begin, the shape of the main character will shift from CS: GO CT models and turn into his real corrupt CT shape. So that's why his name keeps changing. You can get his real identity by pausing some of the frames and looking at the "Killfeed."

You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you'll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.

Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It's much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.

With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.

### 1) Decide Your Montage Story/Type

Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.

Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.

### 2) Record Your Gameplay Footage

The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.

That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you'll capture the moment after interesting things occur.

Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.

Once you've all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer. This program allows you to edit your video clips and add cool effects that will make viewers keep watching.

### 3) Import You Videos to Media Library

You only have to import the videos to Filmora's media library and then drag and drop them into the timeline, where you can start making the edits.

By right-clicking on the clip in your timeline, you'll see the options to zoom, speed, change, split, or trim your videos. You can also add sound effects by going to the Audio Tab.

### 4) Choose Background Music for Your Montage

Music will help make your gaming montage engaging. Make sure you use a license-free track if you plan to post it on social media.

Using copyrighted music tracks and uploading the video on social media platforms can lead to video strikes. Luckily, Filmora has loads of non-copyrighted music tracks.

Navigate to Stock Media, where you'll find non-copyrighted music on Pixabay, and choose the one you prefer.

## Useful Tips for Making a Gaming Montage

Making gaming montages can help you build a large online community if you do the right thing. When making a gaming montage, there are a few tips that you should keep in mind. They include:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Apply Velocity Effects

Adding velocity effects to your montage will help get the attention of viewers. You can couple the transition between scenes with a speed ramping effect.

Include slow motion where there is a gunshot or other big gaming moment. You can then speed up things to quickly move into another scene. You can create these velocity effects in Filmora and make it smooth.

### 2\. Avoid Game Loading Scenes

Do not include game loading scenes or any unnecessary clips in the gaming montage. Your audience does not have the time to wait for the scenes to load because they want to see action fast.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Sync Gunshot with Music Beat

Try to match gunshot sounds with beats and rhythms in shooter video games. The beats of the music and the soothing sync of gunshots will catch viewers' attention and your video will become popular among gamers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Add Creative Transitions

You can spice up your gaming montage by adding transitions, especially when you have loads of clips for the montage. But avoid overusing it, as you could confuse your audience with a range of dazzling and glaring transitions.

### 5\. Color Grade the Video for the Mood

Use color grading to your advantage, as it can set the mood of your viewers. You can decide to make some scenes black and white to catch the viewers’ attention.

### 6\. Add Video Vignettes for Special Occasions

You can add dark edges around the corners of your video to highlight action or create a certain mood. For gameplay based on a story, use vignetting to add a sense of nostalgia or as a flashback that shows viewers the past.

You can use Filmora to apply the vignetting effect by heading to Advanced Color Tuning, then clicking the Vignette option. You can then add the vignette effect to the video. Additionally, you can adjust the vignette's exposure, feather, roundness, size, and highlights.

### 1\. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

Uploaded by DemixB, the Call of Duty Game Montage uses Jacques Offenbach's Can Can Music track. It's a happy song that has a tempo of 81 BPM. The track has average danceable energy, and it's somewhat danceable.

DemixB set the gunshot in the montage video to the music tune. The track builds up to the climax when the gunshot echoes with the attention-grabbing orchestral explosions.

### 2\. ShutteR's Gaming Montage

In the gaming montage uploaded by ShutteR on his YouTube channel, he used velocity effects to enhance the video. You'll see that the transition in each scene is paired with adrenaline-pumping, speed-ramping effects.

ShutteR used a slow-motion to highlight action in each scene, then speeds up again when he wants to fast out into the next scene.; this makes the video more engaging to keep viewers glued to their screens.

### 3\. NEVERMORE \[CS: GO\]

NEVERMORE \[CS: GO\] was uploaded by Fuze on his YouTube channel, and it has creative gameplay. The gaming montage is based on a story. He did the project with Apel, an artist who designed the Fever Dream series skins in the video.

The basic idea of this gaming montage was that the main game character is a corrupted policeman with purple glowing eyes because he's not human.

When the edits begin, the shape of the main character will shift from CS: GO CT models and turn into his real corrupt CT shape. So that's why his name keeps changing. You can get his real identity by pausing some of the frames and looking at the "Killfeed."

## Tips for Choosing Location and Scheduling Music Video

Making viral music videos is everyone's dream; what if you get exact tips to follow before shooting your music video to make it high-ranked? Obviously, it'll be a treat for you!

Planning and preparing before the shoot is the key to making a music video successful. You can only achieve this after location scouting and emerging with the best one. And scheduling for big projects before the day is more important. Let's directly move towards the things to consider before shooting!

## Location scouting

The pleasant and eye-catchy location always makes your music video trending or flopping. You should first go with your budget and then come up with location ideas. In the upcoming tip, we will use 3lau's song "Tokyo" as an example.

![finding the right location for the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/finding-the-right-location-for-the-music-video.jpg)

If you are going with large projects, you need to consider the following requirements!

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Availability of electricity

You need rig lights and a large lighting setup to make your video more glow and give them aesthetic vibes. For this, make sure you choose a location where light is readily available.

### 2\. Separate room

During shooting for big projects, you need room to store all gear and sensitive equipment in one place for many days.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Check the size

The foremost thing in choosing the location is to check the Height and Width of the studio. They should be enough to rig the lights in the studio easily and place every required thing in a decided space.

For Example, while shooting a 3lau song, there is a need for a bus to come into the studio easily, but there is an issue in entering the bus due to height issues of the door. Due to this, the director changed the location at the spot to sort out this issue.

**Note:** During public shooting, ensure that the space is empty, and there should be no interruption of the public in filming the shots.

![public interruption in shots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/public-interruption-in-shots.jpg)

The weather is also a major factor when shooting a video, which you must check before the shoot days. After selecting and scouting the location, now it's time to make a schedule which you'll get in hand in the below lines!

## Scheduling for the Music Video

If you have a big project and more scenes to shoot, it's better to make a whole plan about each and everything. You have to make a schedule of using even a single light at a specific time and space. The following are the main considerations you should take care of!

### 1\. Pre-Rig Day

You need to come to the setup before the filming day to check the main things like electricity, measure exact spaces, check the lightning setup, loaded everything such as the bus, crew, and gears.

### 2\. A Call Sheet

A call sheet is a daily shot list given to the cast and crew to follow the timelines, and it contains the phone number of everyone, their location, and the time to arrive on set. It also includes the nearest hospital, sunset, and sun-rising timing.

![call sheet of tokyo song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/call-sheet-of-tokyo-song.jpg)

It consists of one to two pages according to shoot days and has a plan of everything that happens after the Pre-Rig day.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Note:** When you wrap up for day 1, you have another call sheet for day 2, day 3, and so on!

### 3\. Do Planning

You need to work efficiently and smartly to maintain everything according to the plan. You can cut the filming into halves to have a better lighting setup and character availability. On the shot day, you must change the lighting and rigging setup as little as possible.

**Examples**

On day 1 of the Tokyo song, the filming is done in two halves; the first half day goes towards filming everything in the bus, and the other half day, there is a shoot of everything outside the bus.

While in day 2, there is a filming of every memory. For this, there are setups of rooms and homes for making perfect shots according to the requirements of a music video.

### 4\. Take No Stress

## Add Fade in Windows Video Editor

A recent development in the media business is the fading into and out of videos, which significantly improves and cools down a scene. It causes the movie to twist and gives it a photorealistic appearance, giving the sense of depth. Too much or too little fading might ruin the whole impact of the video that has been generated, which is why we're providing instructions on how to apply fade in Windows video editors.

People often search for How to Add Fade in after effects but in such tools, backgrounds are used to achieve fading, so what should you do if you want your movie on your Windows 10 desktop to fade to black, white, or another color? We suggest the solution in this article that would be of assistance. It is suggested that you apply the video fades using a backdrop clip which is either black or white. Video fades come in two varieties: fade in and fade out. A video or picture may gradually appear from a black, white, or colored backdrop using a technique called a "fade-in." On the other hand, a video or picture may gradually blend into a white, black, or multicolored backdrop using the fade-out technique.

## Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor

To begin with, you'll need top-notch editing software for your movies. We advise you to try Windows Video Editor if you use Windows. It is slick, simple, and enjoyable to use. The Microsoft Store's most downloaded video editing app is also this one. To test how it works, you may install it for free. The Windows video editor is a strong tool that makes it simple for users to utilize the fundamentals of video editing. It has the ability to move, concatenate, cut, and add the Fading effects to videos. However, it lacks the transitions needed to insert them into videos or in between them.

### **Steps to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor**

Step1 Open Windows Video Editor and choose the video clip you wish to apply a fade to.

![open windows video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-windows-video-editor.jpg)

Step2 To display further effects, click the down arrow in the corner of the effects tray after selecting the Visual Effects tab. The effects are divided into a group named Motions and Fades. To get an explanation and a sample of what the effects do, hover your mouse cursor over the thumbnails of the effects.

![visual effects windows video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/visual-effects-windows-video-editor.jpg)

The available effects include pixelate, ripple, and a simple fade in or fade out to black or white. Apply No Effect, the first thumbnail in the list of visual effects, after choosing the clip and the visual effect you wish to remove.

Step3 Select the desired video portion, then click the Edit tab under Video Tools to fade the video sound. The ribbon's initial part is devoted to audio controls. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
Step4 Select the Options option beneath Motion and Fades to fade your videos and the soundtrack. The first ribbon area is devoted to audio controls, much to what we saw for video sound. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.

![choose fade effects windows editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-fade-effects-windows-editor.jpg)

It is pertinent to mention here that the windows video editor does not support the fading feature that is included in the transitions. It can be used for various things, however the editor lacks fading options. We thus provide an alternative technique for fading the movies and words on Windows or iOS platforms in the upcoming part.

## Part 2\. How To Blur Your Background In Premiere Pro?

Below, we’ve provided a step-by-step guide to help you **blur the background in Premiere Pro:**

![add snapshot in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/insert-snapshot.png)

Step 16

Move the Playhead 3 frames forward from the starting point of the clip you just added. Unhide Track 6\. Double-click on the clip on the right side of Track 5 and click on **“+Add”.** Move the Playhead 5 seconds forward and adjust the Upward Outline to fit the text.

![stretch text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/fit.png)

Step 17

Move the Playhead 5 frames forward again. Drag the **Y-axis** value to the left until the outline clip overlaps the main text. Then, reduce the **Opacity** to **0%.** Move the Playhead to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Cut the Track and delete the clip on the right side. Lastly, **Lock** Track 5.

![edit track five](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/track-five.png)

Step 18

Drag the **Downward Outline** snapshot to Track 4\. Then, repeat the same process as in **Step 16** and **Step 17.**

Step 19

Drag the Upward Outline snapshot to Track 3 at the 17th frame. Double-click on it and change the **Opacity** to **0%.**

![insert snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/topside.png)

Step 20

Now, move 5 frames forward and increase the **Opacity** back to **100%.** Then, drag the **Y-axis** value to the right until the screen looks like this.

![move clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edge.png)

Step 21

Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 5 seconds. Click on **“+Add”** to add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead 5 frames forward. Double-click on the clip and stretch it from side to side to match something like this.

![resize clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resize.png)

Step 22

Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 16 seconds. Split the clip and delete the part on the right side. Hide Track 4, 5, and 6\. Then, take a Snapshot. Drag this Snapshot next to the clip on Track 3\. Place the Playhead on 1 minute and 18 seconds. Then, unhide Track 4, 5, and 6.

Step 23

Double-click on the clip on the right side of Track 3\. Add a keyframe by pressing **“+Add”.** Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 23 seconds. Now, resize the clip back to its original size by moving the rectangle left and right. Right now, it should look like this.

![preview screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/preview.png)

Step 24

Move the Playhead 5 frames forward. Drag the **Y-axis value** to the left until the screen looks like this.

![move clip downward](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/overlap.png)

Step 25

Move the Playhead 5 frames forward again. Drag the value of the **Y-axis** to the left until the screen looks like this. Then, change the **Opacity** to **0%.** Finally, split the clip at 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Delete the part on the right side. Lock Track 3.

![move outline down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/last-overlap.png)

Step 26

Next, drag the Downward Snapshot on Track 2 and follow the same process as in **Steps 19 through 25.**

Step 27

Unhide the Background clip at the bottom of the Timeline. Then, Unlock Track 6\. Split the clip on Track 6 at the 15th frame.

![split clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/split.png)

Step 28

Move the Playhead at the beginning of the Timeline. Click on the first part of the clip on Track 6\. Add a keyframe. Drag the **X-axis** value to the right until the word disappears out of the screen. Like this. 👇Then, move the Playhead to the 6th frame and **Reset** the X-axis value to **0.0.**

![drag word out of screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/disappear.png)

Step 29

Take the Playhead to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Split it. Now, move the Playhead to 2 minutes and 19 seconds and add a keyframe. Lastly, take the Playhead to the very end of the clip and drag the text to the right side until it's out of the screen once again.

![drag text out of screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-text.png)

Step 30

Go to the **Effects** tab. Select **Glitch** from the panel on the left. Then, apply **“Glitch Dispersion”** and **“Glitch Stripe 2”** to the clips at the start and at the end.

![apply effects filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/effect.png)

## There Are Many Aspects to Consider when It Comes to Publishing a Video. Safety and Privacy Aspects Are some of Them. If You're Looking to Blur Out a Bystander or Cut Out Profanities From Your Video with Filmora, This Is the Right Article for You

There are many aspects to consider when it comes to publishing a video. Safety and privacy aspects are some of them. If you're looking to blur out a bystander or cut out profanities from your video with Filmora, this is the right article for you.

## Part 1\. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora

Filmora's powerful video editing menu includes easy tweaking on audio. You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.

Step1 Create a new project and import the video to Filmora.

![import the video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 Separate the audio component from the video by right-clicking on the video and selecting the Detach Audio option. You can now edit each of them individually.

![detach the audio component](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Mark the part to place the start of the beep using the playhead and click the Split icon on the editor’s toolbar.

![split to separate the target segment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-3.gif)

Step4 Place the playhead at the end of the censored segment and click Split. Double-click on the segment to open the audio editing menu, then you can remove that part of the audio or lower the volume.

![adjusting the split audio segment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-4.jpg)

Step5 Click the **Audio>Audio** Effects menu on the upper left corner of the screen. After you find the Beep effect, drag the track to the audio timeline and place it in between the split section. Adjust trimming and volume until the censor is placed correctly.

![adjust the sound effect placement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-5.gif)

## Part 2\. How to add mosaic to video with Filmora

Whether you want to hide a passerby's face or your own, or even other types of objects, Wondershare Filmora is ready to take on the task. While its nifty face-off function automatically follows the movement of a marked face, the mosaic effect is the fast and perfect solution for a static object in the video.

Step1 After importing a video to Filmora, tap on the Effects tab and find the Mosaic filter from the gallery.

![find the mosaic effect from the effects library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-6.jpg)

Step2 Drag the Mosaic filter to the timeline just above the main video track.

![drag the mosaic effect to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-7.jpg)

Step3 A yellow box will appear in the viewer. You can drag and adjust its size to hide the targetted object. You can also adjust the opacity and intensity of the effect using the adjustment menu, accessible when you double-click the yellow box.

![adjust the mosaic effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-8.jpg)

If the targetted object moves, you can set the automatic tracking before adding the mosaic filter by clicking on the **Motion Tracking**\>**Start Tracking** located above the timeline. Before you place the filter, preview and adjust the tracking frame to ensure tight proof censor.

![setting up motion tracking feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-9.jpg)

## Conclusion

Wondershare Filmora offers a large array of special effects that goes beyond simply trimming, cropping, splitting, or adding transitions to your video. You can add some special effects to your video as well, such as Blur, Face-Off, Mosaic, Tilt Shift and Jump Cut at Beat. On top of completing it with audio effects, you can also add subtitles or typography easily.

With Filmora, you can always enhance your video within minutes with excellent quality.

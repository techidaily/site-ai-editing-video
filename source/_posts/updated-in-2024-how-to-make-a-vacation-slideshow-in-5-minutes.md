No matter the reason, there are numerous ways to remove slow motion from iPhone video. In this article, you'll learn the various methods to convert slow-motion video into a regular video on your iPhone or iPad. Also, learn the steps involved in achieving it.

So, let's start.

## How To Convert Slow Motion Video to Normal on iPhone and iPad

Due to the slow-motion and Time-lapse modes that are built into the iPhone, people may quickly record slo-mo and time-lapse clips using their iOS smartphone cameras.

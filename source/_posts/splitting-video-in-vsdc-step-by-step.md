This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.

### Examples of Speed Ramping

It works especially well when utilized to focus the viewer's attention on a certain moment or action in your videos, such as a tough jump or an impending bullet. Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.

The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.

### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.

* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.

### Speed Ramping Tips

* **High Frame Rate:** The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it's been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.
* **Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:** Another possibility is to modify your video's frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip's properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip's parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.
* **Purposeful** **Time Remapping:** Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.

## Part1: When Do You Need a Hand Shake Effect?

![hand shake effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/final-cut-pro-camera-shake-effect-2.jpg)

Adding effects to your videos is a great way to make them more impactful. However, you need to apply them correctly for them to be effective. The following information explores different aspects of the Final Cut Pro camera shake effect, including its definition, why video creators use it, and how best to apply it.

### What are hand shake effects for?

Hand shake effects are video adjustments you apply to specific scenes that make the shot vibrate. Depending on the software you use, there are multiple variations of the effect. In addition, developers refer to it by different names. For example, Final Cut Pro users know it as the earthquake effect, which is a preset video effect in most versions of the software.

Typically, video creators use the Final Cut Pro camera shake effect to add energy to their videos. As such, their scenes are more dramatic and encourage you to pay more attention to the video. For example, you can apply the effect to indicate the arrival of the villain in your video. In addition, the effect will be more impactful if the villain is a giant.

You can also use the camera shake video effect for the following purposes:

* Break the monotony in a scene. Applying this scene after a long dialogue scene will give your audience a brief respite, allowing them to regain their focus.
* The camera shake effect can also be an effective tool to build your brand identity. Instead of applying it during the screenplay, you can use it in the end credits to introduce your logo to audiences. Furthermore, you can include a creative sound track for additional emphasis.

### What kind of shots are best for such an effect?

The best shot to apply the camera shake effect are still shots. This is because they give you extra creative room with the scene since the subjects are facing the camera directly from a level angle. As such, you can customize unique motion patterns for each subject when applying the camera shake effect.

### Is it better to hand shake when shooting or add the effects?

Although it may seem tempting to physically shake the camera when shooting, most filmmakers prefer to add the effect during editing. This is because shaking the camera during shooting may result in unusable shots in post-production. For example, shooting a car scene from a hand-held camera in the passenger seat often results in shaky footage. As such, video creators mount the camera on a tripod to capture still shots and then add the camera shake during post-production.

Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video.

Step9 Then click **Export** and choose **Create Video**. Let's name it **freeze frame 1** and click on Export.

![replaced the freeze frame and paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png)

When you're prepared to begin producing your videos, go to Renderforest, register for an account, or sign in if you already have one.

Check out the vast selection of templates under "**Intros and logos**" in the "**Create Video**" section of the navigation menu. Here, you can select the intro you like most and begin altering it, or use our advanced search filters to locate the specific content you require.

![select intros and logos renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-intros-and-logos-renderforest.jpg)

We'll use the "**Swift Glitch Logo**" template for this tutorial, enabling you to present your logo with glitch effects. This template may produce intro and outro movies for presentations, your YouTube channel, lobby backgrounds, and other uses.

Select your preferred template and click the "**Create now**" button to start.

![swift glitch logo renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/swift-glitch-logo-renderforest.jpg)

Your logo should now be uploaded with a transparent background (PNG). You can upload it in one of three ways: using an image URL directly from your device or selecting an existing file from your "Media library." If you don't already have one, you may make one right away using our logo maker tool, which is also accessible in the editor.

![edit image for intro video renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-image-for-intro-video-renderforest.jpg)

Write your company's name, tagline, or other brief words in the text field once you've added your logo. To save the changes, don't forget to click "Save and close."

You can select the overall design of your logo and the preferred font style in the "Style" section.

![select style look for intro renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-style-look-for-intro-renderforest.jpg)

Select your preferred color scheme in the "**Color**" section now. You can choose between two color schemes made by our design team and manually selectable custom colors in this section.

Go to the "**Music**" area to select a song for your intro. You can add one or pick from our "**Music collection**." You can record a voice-over in the editor or upload one for your introduction.

Well done! Let's check out your introduction in the "**Preview**" area now. Click "**Free preview**" to check your video and ensure you like the outcome. Click back and tweak the introduction if you need to make any adjustments.

Instantly create professional introduction videos in your browser! Utilize our intro maker, and let its unique touch set your videos apart from the competition.

Enjoy making videos with Renderforest, where your imagination is the only restriction.

## Competition to Renderforest

Animoto and PowToon are a couple of the site's main rivals. These are excellent online video editing tools, but Renderforest stands out because it is simple to use and enables even novice users to create, share quickly, and download "broadcast grade videos."

**Renderforest vs PowToon**

One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It's challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.

PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn't provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.

PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.

Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.

Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.

Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.

Fortunately, you don't have to believe us. You may experience all the main advantages of Renderforest yourself by giving it a try. Check out the pros and drawbacks list in our Renderforest review if you need more assistance.

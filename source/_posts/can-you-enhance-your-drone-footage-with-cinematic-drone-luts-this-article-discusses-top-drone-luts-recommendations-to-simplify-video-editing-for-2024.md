## Using Montage In Movies | Learn to Use Montage With Movies

As with many new things in life, Montage isn't your best friend right off the bat. So, if you want to learn to use montages with movies, they need to be the right ones. If you don't know what Montage is, it is a way of compressing an action or series of actions into a short amount of time. We look at movies because they are a common type of entertainment everyone has seen before, which makes them easier to understand as a concept.

Using Montage is a great way to create engaging video content. There are many people interested in the topic of Montage, so if you get that video out there, you can easily find an audience. When used in conjunction with YouTube advertising, creating videos about Montage could be an excellent business idea for you.

Learning how to use Montage properly can be challenging. The process isn't intuitive, and using it can feel like hiding random pieces around your page. But, when you watch the right movies, they can help you understand how to use this tool effectively. So, take some time, check out these movies, and learn how to get the most out of Montage!

## What Is A Montage?

The definition of a montage is a "series of short scenes or episodes forming a unified whole." That definition can lead to different interpretations of a montage and can be applied to any art medium. A "montage" isn't just for movies. Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.

If you've seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you've probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.

## Purpose of Montage

Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project. Even though these types of movies have become a common genre, there's a list of reasons why this is popular in movies today.

* Montage has several uses in movies. Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm. These different uses of Montage do come with their styles, but they all share a few common traits.
* They're often used to condense periods of storytime into much smaller but more entertaining segments. The word montage is French for "to construct from many parts ."Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.
* This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them. A great example of a montage was used in Rocky when Rocky was training for his fight with Apollo Creed.
* A montage allows filmmakers to explore a theme using several sequential shots that can't be covered in a single shot.

## Learn To Use Montage With These Movies

### 1\. Rocky (1976)

The training montage is popular in cinema. A montage like this helps us follow how the protagonist prepares himself for a life-threatening fight and claims honor in society. Sylvester Stallone plays Robert "Rocky" Balboa, going through the rigorous preparations for his fight. A song by Bill Conti called "Gonna Fly Now" is playing in the background, contributing to the scene's energy.

Rocky (1976)

### 2\. Scarface (1983)

A fictional Cuban Tony (Al Pacino) becomes a gangster in Brian De Palma's 1983 film Scarface against the backdrop of the cocaine boom of the 1980s.

In this montage sequence, Tony becomes the biggest drug lord in Miami and controls nearly all the cocaine that comes through the city.

### 3\. Goodfellas (1990)

Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is a gangster film set in 1950s New York City, one of the best. In it, Irish-Italian Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) is portrayed as he rises through the ranks of the crime branch of his Brooklyn neighborhood. As we watch this Montage, we see Henry and his gang members viciously murdering anyone who stands in their path. This edit is beautifully complemented by Eric Clapton's "Layla." voice-over.

Goodfellas (1990)

### 4\. Trainspotting (1996)

Ewan McGregor stars in Danny Boyle's black comedy, which tells the tale of drug addict Mark Renton (Danny Boyle). Mark tries to get clean and get back on his feet. Despite this, drug enticements and friend influence are major deterrents. Through this introductory Montage, we are introduced to the protagonist's lifestyle. In addition, the film explores the themes of drug abuse, addiction, and nihilism.

### 5\. Run Lola Run (1998)

In his movie Run Lola Run (1998), Tom Tykwer tells the story of Lola (Franka Potente) and Mani (Moritz Bleibtreu) as they face the different possibilities that arise from a single event in their lives. This Montage shows Lola bumping into various people as she begins to sprint. Her encounter has a profound impact on their lives. Through Montage, the film is given a sense of exhilarating pace and multi-layered visual design.

Run Lola Run (1998)

### 6\. Requiem for a Dream (2000)

Hubert Selby Jr.'s titular novel is the source material for Darren Aronofsky's psychological drama. Four people trapped by their addictions are the focus of the narrative. By watching this Montage, a viewer can get a better sense of the world or the film's characters. As a result of their drug addictions, four ambitious people will eventually have their dreams dashed. As a result, we gain insight into how addiction takes hold of the characters' minds and bodies.

Requiem for a Dream (2000)

### 7\. Swades (2004)

Songs have played an integral role in bringing the story of the film to life in the hands of some of India's most thoughtful filmmakers. Among them is Ashutosh Gowariker. Montage techniques are used to create the title song sequence of his film Swades. The fictional Indian village of Charanpur, where the protagonist Mohan Bhargava (Shahrukh Khan) has lived, is a source of great trauma for the protagonist. As he ends up returning to India, the song signifies his development psychologically.

Swades (2004)

### 8\. Whiplash (2014)

Miles Teller plays Andrew Neiman, a promising young drummer who enrolls in a tough music conservatory. Damien Chazelle directs the film. Terence Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) mentors him, and he is determined to see his students' dreams come true. Neiman pushes himself to his limits in this Montage, suffering a breakdown as a result. Edited shots and tempo match the visual images to accentuate the protagonist's mental state.

Whiplash (2014)

### 9\. Gone Girl (2014)

Gillian Flynn's eponymous novel is the basis for David Fincher's psychological crime drama. On their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy Elliott Dunne (Rosamund Pike) disappears, and Nicholas Dunne (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect.

After hitting herself with a hammer, the sequence ends.

The family comes up with a cunning plan to exploit her allergy to peaches. In the closing montage, they convince Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-Jeong) that Moon-Gwang has tuberculosis.

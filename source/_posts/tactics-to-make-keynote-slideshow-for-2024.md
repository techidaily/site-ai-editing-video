Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of **TTS** technology or **Text-to-Speech technology**.

As its name suggests, **TTS** or **Text-to-Speech** is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself/herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as **speech synthesis**, which means artificial human speech production.

Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.

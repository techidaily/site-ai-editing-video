The program enables users to apply effects to TikTok videos in order to facilitate this kind of production. TikTok offers a lot of features, making it simple to become lost inside the application.

With this guide you can add effects to your video to make it more visually appealing; this is one of the best possibilities. These effects might include slow motion, stickers, or even special effects like visual effects.

## Part 1\. Using TikTok In-App Effects

If you use Tik Tok often, you undoubtedly already know that this app has several effects available as well. These consist of stickers, time effects, video coverings, and filter effects. As soon as you record or submit a video clip, these effects are readily triggered. Simply locate the "Effects" option to begin adding them to your movie. However, using text or caption effects is not possible in this manner. However, it is a useful method for improving your Tik Tok video before sharing it.

Step1 Open the app after installation and add a video by touching the "+" button to start a new recording or by tapping the "Upload" button to upload media files from your picture library.

Step2 On the right side of the screen, tap "Filters." You may now apply effects when a video file is available by touching the "Effects" button in the bottom left corner of the app.

## Part 2\. Adding Effects Before Recording

Many people are hesitant to record a TikTok video with more than one filter effect applied. You've probably seen that a lot of well-known makers create videos that combine many different effects. Actually, the procedure is rather easy. You may apply as many filters as you'd like on the TikTok app while recording time stamps one at a time only! It is not feasible or the option is not presently accessible on the app if you wish to apply many effects at once.

**Steps to Add Effects to TikTok Videos Before Recording:**

Step1 Open the TikTok app and click the Create button in the lower-middle of the screen.

![tap create new video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-create-new-video-tiktok.jpg)

Step2 On the right side of the screen, tap Filters. The screen's bottom will reveal a pop-up menu for filters.

![tap filter from right side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-filter-from-right-side.jpg)

Step3 To see the choices, swipe. By tapping the tabs, you may quickly navigate to that particular set of filters. Alternatively, you may just swipe and browse through each choice. Select a filter by tapping it. To lessen or intensify the filter effect, move the slider to the left or right.

![select protrait tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-protrait-tiktok.jpg)

Step4 If you like the result, press the screen to start recording your video normally. Tap the Stop symbol at the very left to remove the filter.

## Part 3\. Adding Effects After Recording

Forgot to use a filter effect before to beginning your recording? Not to worry! On the Preview page, you may also apply a filter to your clips. By selecting Visual under Effects after recording or uploading your TikTok video, you may also add some lovely dynamic filter effects. You may achieve that by saving the films to your camera roll after applying each effect individually to the same clip. then launch the app's video recorder, add the previously recorded video, and choose a new filter to apply to the video clip.

**Steps to Add Effects to TikTok After Recording:**

Step1 The first step is to launch the program on your phone and touch the "+" icon. Simply choose a filter effect for your movie by going right to the Filters section here.

![tap add icon tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-add-icon-tiktok.jpg)

Step2 The filters button, which is indicated by three circles, must be tapped in the second stage. You may choose the TikTok effect you wish to use once all of the effects are shown on the screen.

![choose effects tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-effects-tiktok.jpg)

Step3 You have access to a wide variety of effects once you enter the effects gallery. Select the effect that best suits your video and that you prefer. After making your decision, leave the effects gallery and upload the recording.

Step4 Click the review button to examine your video with the effect applied before publishing it. This will lead you to a preview screen. Before you actually publish it, you may also add music and other components.

![publish and post video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/publish-and-post-video-tiktok.jpg)

## Part 4\. Add Filter on Video in TikTok

You may apply the filters after you film the movie, just as you do with the effects. You just need to visit visual. There is no way to identify the filter that your favorite TikToker used on his video on TikTok. Don't worry, they often include the effect they employ in the hashtag or description, so you are still welcome to utilize it. To hunt for filter effects on TikTok, you might request a search function.

**Steps to Add Filter on Videos in TikTok:**

Step1 Click the "+" symbol in the bottom menu's center after launching the TikTok app on your phone. Press the "+" button to start your camera before applying a specific filter.

![add filter tiktok videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-filter-tiktok-videos.jpg)

Step2 The "effects" symbol, which looks like a winking emoji, should be tapped. You will have access to a wide variety of TikTok filters once inside. On your screen, click the Filters symbol in the top right corner.

![add video effects on tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-video-effects-on-tiktok.jpg)

Step3 The options screen opens when you press the effect filter button. Your effect will appear in your video once you just hit the red button. When you are presented with all of these filters, choose the one that best fits your video and give it a try.

![choose desired filters tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-desired-filters-tiktok.jpg)

Step4 You may apply the filter to your video after you have officially made your decision. After doing this, leave the filter gallery and begin recording your video. Now that all of these procedures have been completed, you are able to capture your video with the effect on it.

![apply filters to videos tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-filters-to-videos-tiktok.jpg)

## The Bottom Line

Filters on TikTok work similarly to filters on other social media applications. However, there is no option or function in the TikTok app that allows you to look for a filter effect under the Filters or Effects tab. However, since most TikTok users constantly upload videos with any filter and strive to put the filter's name and hashtags on the films, you may search for some videos with the identical filter. Your films will get flair and individuality thanks to this simple technique, which also gives certain filters a chance to catch on as trends.

## Detailed Tutorial to Rotate a Video in Cyberlink PowerDirector

Video Editing is a craft that is highly dependent on various characteristics of your video. But the way one presents it or goes about filming clips also has a profound effect on the end product. And as you may know, not every aspect of a video production activity always goes without hiccups. But editing can come in clutch as it can easily solve minor problems like skewed footage that was shot at the wrong angle or is upside down (an issue that can happen while using mobile phones).

Thus, with this article, we will be looking at steps to rotate a video in Cyberlink PowerDirector to help you when required. We have also mentioned the steps you will need to follow in Wondershare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X._

## Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector

Put yourself in a situation where you've just finished filming a project with your smartphone but end up realizing that the footage isn't in the right orientation by default. While the error has an easy fix on most smartphones, you can also perform this action with video editing tools.

Also, while this form of rotating might be the most basic implementation of the feature, you can often use the feature to add a dynamic nature to your video with Keyframes.

**Definition:** Keyframes in Video Editing is a software feature that allows an editor to set start and endpoints (denoted by In and Out Markers), presenting the opportunity to custom clip properties between the two positions. The set changes occur gradually as the playhead continues moving through the clip. Properties that can undergo modification with this method are zoom, rotation, colors, positions, etc.

The process of rotating clips is fairly straightforward; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.

_If you do not have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting_ [_Cyberlink's official website_](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)_._

**Step 1:** Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 and choose Full Mode.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-1.jpeg)

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.

**Step 2:** Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.

For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**EXTRA**

Rotation added in the PiP Designer will function as a keyframe-based rotation action. Right-click on the video in the preview window, choose Edit and then Modify to access this menu.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

Following this, you can click on the Motion Tab, go into Rotation Settings, and modify the angle with greater precision. In the Preview Window, you will now be able to see the rotating video.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-5.jpeg)

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**

Though Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 is a powerful video editing tool, we felt its menus were not as simple to navigate. Accessing the rotate function while available in the forefront, the use of PiP Designer didn't feel intuitive.

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , rotating footage only happens via the Edit Option, and this straightforward approach felt simple. As for those who want to use Keyframes, the integration of this feature right above the Timeline is an appreciated convenience.

This emphasis on quick accessibility is present with almost every function in Filmora, and we believe this to be a significant advantage. The use of modern and unique iconography also increases familiarity, an aspect that will always be welcoming to new and budding creators.

_If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

To help you learn how to use the rotate function and show you an example of the easy accessibility in Filmora, here is how you can use the feature to get the output you desire.

Once you have a new project open in Filmora, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a Media File to edit into your Video Project.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-6.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video clip onto the Timeline and then select it with a mouse click to activate further interactions.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-7.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the Edit Option (marked in Red).

This will bring up the Edit Window in the left-top corner of your screen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-8.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Click on the Transform Menu and use the Rotation Slider to edit the orientation.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-9.jpeg)

Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.

**BONUS**

Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-10.jpeg)

## The Bottom Line

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn't always the most accurate.

And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.

_If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

To help you learn how to use the rotate function and show you an example of the easy accessibility in Filmora, here is how you can use the feature to get the output you desire.

Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.

**BONUS**

Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.

## The Bottom Line

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn't always the most accurate.

And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.

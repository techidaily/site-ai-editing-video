Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.

### 4\. [Skeleton breaking screen](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Skeleton-breaking-screen.html)

The broken screen is the classic prank suitable for any event and day. But simply using apps or replacing the wallpaper on your friend's or spouse's mobile doesn’t cut in this age and day.

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens.

Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. [Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/girl-blonde-portrait-halloween-43000089959.html)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video? There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.

02 [10 Top AR Apps Worth Trying](#Part 2)

03 [What New AR Effects Could Be Found in Filmora](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?

Both AR and VR use a distinctive approach and consider different use cases. They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.

The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world.

## Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?

Both AR and VR use a distinctive approach and consider different use cases. They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.

The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.

Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.

The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.

The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of **ar video maker** also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.

## Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?

Both AR and VR use a distinctive approach and consider different use cases. They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.

The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.

Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.

The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.

The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of **ar video maker** also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-cut-pro.jpg)

* It has a powerful architecture for your complex and heavy projects.
* Its fast rendering speed can allow you to conduct Multicam editing.
* It has classic GPU utilization and powerful media organization to allow you to organize assets such as audio and video carefully.

* It has a customizable and streamlined share interface that makes high-quality file delivery easy and fast.

* It is tailored with real-time graphics and cool effects like text and blurs that are easy to apply.

 **Cons:**

* It is complex and thus difficult for beginners.
* It has limited export options.
* It only works on Mac computers.

Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.

**Step1: Create a new project & import media**

When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.

At the top menu bar, click _File > New > Project_ to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘_Use Automatic Settings’_.

At the top menu bar again, click _File > Import > Media_ to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.

After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press _‘Import Selected’_ and then close the media window.

**Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.**

The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.

In your browser, you can set the _‘In_ and _Out’_ points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.

After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the _'Trim tool’._ Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip's endings.

If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.

To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.

**Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects**

**Title and Texts**: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video's timeline. To access those titles you can press the _'Title and Generators’_ icon in the sidebar to open it.

**Transitions**: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “_hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’_ by clicking on its indicated icon.

The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘_Command + 4’_ and make the adjustments.

**Effects**: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘_Effects browser’_ icon to open it.

Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.

**Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.**

**Audio & Music:** At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.

To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word _'Jingle_' and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.

**Color correction**: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.

Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.

To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or _'Option + Cmd + B’_.

Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.

Here are key steps to follow when editing a video with Camtasia.

**Step 1:** Break up steps of a process with lower thirds.

Break any long multi-step video to help lower the viewer’s cognitive load.

**Step 2:** Reinforce texts with video.

Remove any mistakes and extra content such as unnecessary footage from the ends of your recording. If you trim too much drag the clip back to restore. This process is known as trimming.

You can zoom in on the most important section to focus your viewer's attention there.

**Step 3:** Add narrative to video

## Alternative Way to Edit Videos

Getting an appropriate video editing software is quite challenging as the makers of these software sometimes get confused about if the programs needed are for home videos or professional-quality work such as Hollywood movies. This is why you will find that some programs are complex to use while others lack essential features to make your work efficient.

This software is powerful and easy to use and it is built with many features to make your vision come true. It is fit for small scale, medium scale and large businesses.

For macOS 10.12 or later

These steps will help you to know how to edit video with Filmora software;

**Step 1: Start a new project.**

![filmora start new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png)

After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.

**Step 2: Import your media**

![filmora import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png)

The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the _'File > Import Media Folder'_ menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.

After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.

These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.

**Step 3: Add clips to the timeline, trim, adjust appropriately and sequence them.**

![filmora split video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg)

Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.

Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.

After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.

If you want to split a clip in the timeline, pick the scissors by clicking on the ‘_Scissors_’ icon.

When working on your video footage, click the spacebar of your computer keyboard to preview. By doing this, you will be able to see how your clips are joined together.

Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.

**Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays**

![filmora add transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/modify-transitions-win-4.jpg)

Click on the Effect icon at the top of the app and a deep visual library of effects will be visible. If you want to add a certain effect to your active clip, just double-click it.

Add transitions in your video timeline to cut the scene-to-scene. They are quite necessary as they help establish your audience’s attention.

The next thing after adding the transmissions will be adding the overlays and exporting your video by clicking on the '_Export_' button.

**Step 5: Export your finished video.**

![filmora export video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/export-to-local-win-1.png)

You can click the ‘Export’ button and switch to the platform you want your video to be exported.

## Conclusion

Choosing an appropriate video editing tool is equally as important as the video itself. And with the availability of so many of these video editing tools, choosing among them is quite hard. You can easily get confused especially if you are a beginner in the video editing industry. To avoid the complications you need to know what editing software is the best for your project.

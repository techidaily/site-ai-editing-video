### Unique and Distinct Features of Filmora

Software is not nearly as good if it does not have the appropriate set of functionalities, and most users will not bother to use it if it does not include these features. Listed here are the most eagerly anticipated features of Filmora's latest version:

#### Motion Tracking

The Motion Tracking module enables you to identify an object or point inside a video and then have the computer track that object or point to generate a moving path.

It allows you to capture the motion of a moving object in the frame and add text, subtitles, effects, and other components to the frame that follow the moving object's motion as it moves around the screen. After you've constructed that path, you may link any other item to it and have it follow the initial object.

#### Colour Matching Feature

This team has always considered that Filmora's colour grading and correction tools were excellent, but their most recent addition to the 'Color Matching' program has garnered them even more praise.

Colour matching is crucial when trying to merge several video images obtained by two different cameras. In this semi-automated module, you may match video from multiple sources or footage acquired at different times of day with one another.

#### Keyframing Feature

Keyframing is an essential feature for users who wish to boost the appeal of their video by incorporating critical animation sequences throughout the film.

It enables you to create custom animations and have fine-grained control over the effects you apply to your projects via the use of keyframes.

Keyframing becomes critical when creating special effects, custom title cards at the beginning or middle of a film or conjuring precise paths for visuals or picture-in-picture movies to follow.

#### Audio Ducking

Audio ducking is a method used in video editing and production that allows the narrator's voice to be heard consistently and clearly over other sounds on the recording that are happening at the same time, such as background music, without being dominated.

#### Transitions and Vast Amount of Effects

Over 300 special effects, objects, overlays, transitions, and music and audio effects are available whenever and wherever you need them. The bundle includes 25 sound effects and 26 royalty-free recordings, making it a complete package.

Then there are 176 transitions, each of which may be customized to liven up your project. You may also alter and manipulate visuals and text to make your project more aesthetically appealing.

#### Hardcore Video Editing

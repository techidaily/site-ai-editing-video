## How to Add Subtitles in QuickTime Player?

QuickTime is among the most popular multimedia players available for PC users. Developed by Apple Inc. in 1991, it was initially made available for Mac OS. However, from 2005 till 2016, QuickTime was available for Windows operating systems as well. While QuickTime allows you to view images and music, it is a popular choice for playing videos.

Do you use QuickTime player to watch music videos, movies, and TV shows? Well, you may find it interesting that the QuickTime player allows you to add subtitles. As there are multiple methods through which you can add subtitles in QuickTime, we are going to discuss them one by one in this blog. So, let’s start our discussion!

## Method 1: Turn on the Subtitles in QuickTime

As you might know, some videos come with embedded subtitles. It’s up to you whether you want to view them while playing the video or not. If you are playing a video with embedded subtitles in the QuickTime player but are somehow unable to view the subtitles, it’s probably because the subtitles feature is turned off. So, you need to enable the subtitles by following certain steps.

### Steps to Turn on Subtitles in QuickTime

Step1 Open the QuickTime Player application on your Mac computer.

![open quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/turn-on-subtitles-in-quicktime-1.png)

Step2 Play the video having subtitles embedded in it.

Step3 Within the menu bar, find the “view” tab and open it.

![find and open view tab in quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/turn-on-subtitles-in-quicktime-2.png)

Step4 Now, you need to find the subtitles option.

![find and access subtitles option in quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/turn-on-subtitles-in-quicktime-3.png)

Step5 Choose a language in which subtitles are available.

Step6 You will be able to view the subtitles at the bottom of the player window.

Step7 You can also click the “subtitles” button in the playback controls to view the subtitles available with a video.

## Method 2: Download and Add Subtitles to Videos in QuickTime

If you want to play videos in QuickTime that do not have embedded subtitles, you can add subtitles to them manually. With QuickTime player, it is quite easy to add external subtitles files and watch movies and TV shows with subtitles of your choice. However, you first need to download an appropriate subtitles file for a video from a reliable website and then load it onto the QuickTime player.

While downloading subtitles for the QuickTime player, keep in mind that you need subtitles in .QT file format.

### Steps to Add Subtitles to QuickTime Player

Step1 Download the subtitles for the video in the .QT format.

Step2 Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the subtitles file.

Step3 Right-click the file and select the “Open with QuickTime” option.

Step4 You will be able to see the subtitles. Select all the subtitles, right-click and select “Copy”.

Step5 Now, open the video in the QuickTime player.

Step6 In the menu bar, click “Edit” and then “Add to Movie”.

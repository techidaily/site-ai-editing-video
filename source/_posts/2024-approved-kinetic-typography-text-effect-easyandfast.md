## Part 2\. Tips: How to improve product review video

Following these tips will help you improve the quality of your product review videos and make them more enjoyable for your audience.

**1) Make sure your video has the correct resolution and scale**

Having the correct resolution and scale for your video will make sure that it has a high-definition (HD) or high-quality resolution. Also, it will ensure that your video is the correct size when exporting.

If the scale is different from the resolution, then the empty space will be filled with black, and you will get black bars border that makes your video smaller.

**2) Use proper lighting to ensure your video looks clear and bright**

To get proper lighting, you should use natural lighting whenever possible, such as sunlight. However, if you can't shoot during the day or it's difficult to get natural light, you will need to use artificial lighting.

Next, adjust the white balance on your camera. You can also edit the color grading to finalize the look and improve the overall color of your video.

**3) Make sure the audio quality of your video is good**

Poor audio can make your video harder to listen to and turn off viewers.

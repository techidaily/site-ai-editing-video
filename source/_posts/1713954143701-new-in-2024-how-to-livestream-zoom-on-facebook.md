## 5 Methods to Make a Fake Facetime Call Video

Creating fake video call clips for entertainment has been a new norm on social media platforms. If you are looking for a software to create a fake Facetime call video, then let's get started:

5 ways to make a fake facetime call video

### 1\. Filmora

Compatibility: Windows/Mac

Wondershare Filmora is the greatest video editor on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.

This tool is one of the most dependable, aside from the features that allow you to modify video rotation easily.

#### Steps

**Step 1: Import the photo or video files**

Import all your media files, including video, photos, and music. You have two options for importing your videos: drag and drop directly into our software or click import to select the media files you wish to upload.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Edit the video**

Wondershare Filmora's video templates can be added. You can apply music, text, filters and overlays, and motion effects by right-clicking on them and selecting apply. After adding video resources such as text and elements, you may customize the texts by changing the size, placement, etc.

Also, you can add overlay video clips using templates of a video call to make it look like a real call.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-2.jpg)

#### Step 3: Export and Save

### 2\. Kapwing

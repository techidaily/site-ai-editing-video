This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his/her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.

### 05Training on Depth Prediction

YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that **Google’s AI YouTube** researchers used the "mannequin challenge" to understand depth predictions.

In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).

### 06Tackle Fake News

Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.

YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.

## Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?

![youtube recommendation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/techniques-you-never-heard-of-for-learning-ai-marketing-youtube-3.jpg)

YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.

YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.

YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his/her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.

YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.

YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016\. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the "borderline content".

## **Part 1\.** **Unlocking Color Precision: Exploring the Improved Scopes in [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)**

The Blackmagic Design continues to improve the Resolve to make it better with every iteration. The new features improve colorist workflow in less powerful ways. The major improvements include a major facelift to the scope, allowing professions to do more with DaVinci resolve. Let’s have a look at some of these changes:

### **1\. CIE 1931 Color Space**

The inclusion of the CIE chromaticity diagram is perhaps the biggest change to DaVinci scopes. It displays the gamut of the project as set in the Color Management preferences. This makes it a useful alternate way of looking at the trace of an image to judge when the values are out of legal range. It also functions as an educational tool for learning about the range of color spaces.

![cie 1931 color space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-1.JPG)

### **2\. Low Pass Filter**

The wavefront and parade scopes now have a low pass filter, which reduces noise in the trace. This visually sharpens the display of the scopes, allowing easier detection of elements in the frame.

![low pass filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-2.JPG)

The image above shows the major improvements. The second set of waveforms has more defined lines. These have the low-pass filter activated, which makes the scopes easier to read.

### **3\. High, Mid, and Low Views in Vectorscope**

The vectorscope has been added to the ability to toggle the mid-tones, shadows, and highlights of the image independently. You can set the ranges with greater visualization control.

![high, mid, and low views in vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-3.JPG)

As seen in the picture above, the vectorscope controls allow you to select the low, mid, or high range of the image. You can also set the low and high ranges as desired.

### **4\. Histograms Over Curves**

Another great DaVinci scope is the histogram, which now appears outside of the scope panel. The new improvements have embedded the histogram inside the Curves tab on the bottom Palette. Click on the three dots in the Custom Curves tab. The pulldown menu that appears includes the Input or Output of the histogram. With these settings, you can find the element in the frame that helps you make adjustments quickly.

![histograms over curves](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-4.JPG)

### **5\. Scope Quality**

The GPU-accelerated scopes engine allows the scopes to respond quickly. Users have the option to set the quality to high, medium, or low and the scopes will respond to a range of hardware systems. Depending on whether you are working on a stationary short or looking to see how the scopes react in real-time, you will be able to toggle the modes quickly and easily.

![scope quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-5.jpg)

### **6\. YRGB View in Histogram and Parade**

The histogram and parade now come with the ability to view luminance together with the red, green, and blue channels. Users also have the option for YCbCr mode in the Parade.

![yrgb view in histogram and parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-6.jpg)

### **7\. Extents**

These are weak elements in the signore, which are of lesser importance compared to the stronger elements. However, Danvici now allows them to be revealed for a full illustration of the information that lies in the image. Consequently, extents can be used to determine whether the data is being clipped beyond legal limits.

## **Part 2\. Mastering Scopes in DaVinci Resolve: A Brief Guide**

DaVinci scopes help you to analyze images as a basis for color correction. When used properly, scopes help in fixing white balance issues and checking saturation. They also allow you to get the correct exposure and check details like skin tone. To use scopes in DaVinci Resolve, go to the color page in the bottom right corner. You can also click on the small graph icon to view the scope. Here is how to use them:

* [Waveform](#davinci1)
* [Parade (RGB)](#davinci2)
* [Vectorscope](#davinci3)
* [Histogram](#davinci4)

### **1\. Waveform**

The Waveform represents the brightness or luminance of your image. In this video scope, the brightest parts are at the top while the darkest are at the bottom. The pixels are represented from left to right.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-8.JPG)

The Waveform scope on DaVinci Resolve is helpful when you are checking for clipping. This simply means finding out whether the image is too bright or too dark. The waveform also ensures that the image is properly exposed. The colorize feature of the waveform shows the colors of the image while the extent shows the darkest or lightest parts of the image.

### **2\. Parade (RGB)**

The RGB Parade comprises 3 waveforms that represent the luminance of red, green, and blue channels. The approach for reading the parade video scope is similar to that of the waveform. However, you now look at the balance between the colors correct the white balance, and check for a color cast.

![parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-9.JPG)

The Parade works almost in a similar manner as the waveform. It displays the red, green, and blue channels of the image as separate waveforms. This way, you can easily identify and correct color casts while ensuring the colors in the image are balanced. The video scope provides useful information to decide which parts of the image need to be corrected or tweaked further.

### **3\. Vectorscope**

Vectorscope in DaVinci Resolve shows hue and saturation on a circular graph. Hues (the colors) are indicated outside of the color wheel for easier color correction. Saturation is indicated by how far the graph extends from the center.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-10.JPG)

By displaying the hue and saturation of the image as a vector, this video scope helps check skin tones. The scope specifically checks whether skin tones are shifted toward colors such as yellow, magenta, or green. It allows you to make sure that the colors in your subject skin tones are not too saturated or desaturated.

### **4\. Histogram**

Histogram is a video scope in DaVinci Resolve that displays the brightness or luminance of an image from left to right for the RGB channel. The video scope is based on the number of pixels that the colors red, blue, and green have in an image.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-11.JPG)

Using the histogram video scope on DaVinci Resolve allows you to check for overexposure or underexposure in your image. You can also ensure that the image has a good overall brightness range. The scope provides a graphical representation of tonal distribution in each channel. This way, you can evaluate the tone in detail for more accurate brightness and contrast adjustments.

## **Part 3:** **Edit Like a Pro: Mastering Video Scopes in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

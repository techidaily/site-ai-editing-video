After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![unscaled photo in the main play window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png)

To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:

* **Double-click** on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.
* Go into the **Transform** Here you can see multiple settings.
* Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.

![scaling of the photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png)

**Add a Background Blur Effect**

In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Effects** tab above the import window and search for **Blur**.
* Download the blur effect that suits you best and then **drag** the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.

You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.

![photo with blurred background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png)

![adjusting the duration of the transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-16.png)

When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.

![adding the vintage effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-17.png)

Combining a vintage effect with a dreamy glow will make your video pop up even more. To add a nostalgic glow to your video, follow the steps:

* Click on the **effects** and search for **Glow** in the search bar.
* Click and drag the glow effect above the timeline and ensure the effect is in the separate video timeline.

We are almost done. Let us now move toward our outro!

##### Step10 Create an Outro

The steps we will do will be similar to the ones we did initially. As we are creating, we will again need a canvas. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Head to the **media** icon on the bar and scroll until you see the sample **media tab**.
* In the sample color option, **drag** and **drop** the black color at the end of your video.

**Add an Outro Transition**

To finalize things, add a transition effect at the end of the clip by these steps:

* In the **Transition** tab, search for the Fade effect.
* Drag and drop the **Fade** effect between your last video clip and the Black screen.

![adding a black screen at the end](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-19.png)

**Fade out The Audio**

If the audio suddenly ends at the end of your slideshow, it will create a bitter effect. Therefore, you should always fade out audio at the end of the video. To do this, follow the steps mentioned:

* **Double-click** on the audio in the timeline, and the settings list will pop up.
* On the top section of the import window, you will notice fade options.
* In the fade-out bar, drag it to the side to set your fade-out timer.

You can show your friends and family the slideshow or upload it to Youtube. Play the Slideshow Video from the beginning to see the changes.

![import your videos and photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-2.png)

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.

##### Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline

When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want.
* Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![add your photos and videos to your timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-3.png)

Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.

##### Step4 Add the Title

To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.

**Add a Black Screen**

The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:

* Click on the **media** icon from the bar above the import window.
* You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.
* Scroll below to find the **sample media**
* Download the black color if it is not downloaded already.
* Click and drag it down below to the start of your video.

![adding a black screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-4.png)

**Add a Title Tile**

Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a **Title** icon.

* Click on the **title** icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.
* For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called "**Title 29**."

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.

* Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.
* **Double-click** the title to open its settings.
* Here you can type in the text that you want.

![add a title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-5.png)

You can also change its font. When you click on the font bar, a drop-down option will pop up, and you choose whichever you like.

* Change the **animation** of the text title from the top left corner **animation**

**Change The Timing of The Title**

You can also adjust the timing of the title by below steps:

* Click on the **advanced option** in the bottom right corner, and settings will pop up.
* Find the title bar and drag it to the right side to increase the timing of the title.

![change the timing of the title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-6.png)

After adding the title, it's time to go with fading effect as shown below!

##### Step5 Add a Fade effect

You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:

* Search the **Fade** option from the Transitions tab above the import window

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.

* Download the **Fade** transition and **drag** it between the Black screen and the first clip.

![adding a fade effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png)

Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!

##### Step6 Add The Music

You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:

* Click on the **Audio** icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.
* Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.
* Then add it to the timeline's audio track.

**Add Beat Detection**

To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:

* Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.
* You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.
* Click on **Beat detection**.

![adding beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png)

* Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.

**Match The Video With The Audio Markers**

To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:

![matching the video with the audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png)

* Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.
* For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.
* Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.

![synced video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png)

After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![unscaled photo in the main play window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png)

To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:

* **Double-click** on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.
* Go into the **Transform** Here you can see multiple settings.
* Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.

![scaling of the photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png)

**Add a Background Blur Effect**

In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Effects** tab above the import window and search for **Blur**.
* Download the blur effect that suits you best and then **drag** the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.

You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.

![photo with blurred background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png)

##### Step8 Add a Transition

You can also add a transition effect to spice up things. It can get bland when your video or photo changes from one to another. To create a good slideshow video, you can add a transition effect by following the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Transition** icon above the import window.
* **Browse** the library until you find a transition you like, then download one.
* Click on the transition and drag it between the clips.

![transition effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-15.gif)

**Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition**

Now it's time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:

* **Double-click** on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.
* You can adjust the duration by setting the timer as per your requirement.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.

![adjusting the duration of the transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-16.png)

When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.

##### Step9 Add the Effects and Filters

If you create a slideshow video of your trip to a historical place. You can add a Vintage filter to your video to give it that vintage tint. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Head over to the Effects tab, where the **effects library** will open up
* Select any effect and **download**
* Click on the effect and **drag** it to **drop** in the timeline.

![adding the vintage effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-17.png)

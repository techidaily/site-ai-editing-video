### 1\. Get to know the couple

As a wedding videographer, it's important to get to know the couple you're working with. This will help you better capture the essence of their wedding day.

We will focus on putting a background on a green screen in this part.

Let us discuss how to add background to green screen are pretty simple using Filmora.

##### Step1 Add Overlay clip to timeline

Select “Create New Project” to start the editing. At first, you have to choose both the overlay clip and background clip and add them to the timeline. You can either import from the library or drag the files to the timeline in the positions shown in the picture.

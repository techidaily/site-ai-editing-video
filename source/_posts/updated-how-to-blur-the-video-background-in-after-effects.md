**Potential Advantages**

Choosing the Blender 3D design suite for dimensional and motion graphic editing, you are entitled to benefit from the following advantages:

### 01A Free Graphic Suite

Almost every software user has the obvious habit of prioritizing financial equity before all other program credibility. However, you should be relieved to realize that the Blender 3D Suite is available to you without a price tag. Loyal users of the software claim the product to outshine its priced counterparts in terms of features and responsive flexibility.

If you are at the shore of graphic design and 3D modeling, there’s absolutely no better software to jump with, in the creation pool. Talking of the concerns of long term free usage and hidden feature blocking pay walls, there’s no cause to worry.

The software earns most of it financial credits through sales merchandise, donations and Cloud Service, which is a reasonably priced and optional graphic design assistant and application resource.

### 02Open Source Software

Essentially programmed and developed by an expert and skilled core team, the software is liberal enough to entertain open source modifications. Public users of the suite are permitted to make functionality alterations with Python coding. This flexibility of the Blender software is the underlying reason to a community driven increment to the existing top class suite functionalities.

While the public user creativity is responsible for adding a heap of free and paid software functionalities, the suite offers a sale of the specific feature scripts at marketplaces like, Blendermarket.com as a developer support initiative to promote the creation of highly productive graphic tools.

### 03Extensive Pipeline Support

Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.

Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:

**Step 1:**

Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.

**Step 2:**

To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.

**Step 3:**

Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.

**Step 4:**

Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:

**●** Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Mix Shader output to the Surface input

This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.

**Step 10\.** Choose the image area from the Layers panel.

**Step 11\.** Next, use the Knockout function from the Blending Options.

**Step 12\.** Now select both shape layers and group the layers by clicking on New Group from Layers in the menu. Give a desired name to the group.

**Step 13\.** Next, click on the Background layer and choose New Fill or Adjustment Layer.

**Step 14\.** Tap on the Polaroid layer group from the Layers panel and select it.

**Step 15\.** Go to the Edit menu and select the Free Transform option.

## Part 3: What Should a Good LUT Video Editing App Have?

When looking for a good LUT to apply to your videos and photos, there are many things to look for. Some of the important options that a good LUT app should have been discussed here.

* **Multiple LUT Formats**: A good iPhone LUT app should support different LUT formats such as .cube, .3dl, .look, and more. It allows you to use LUTs from different sources and import them easily into your application.
* Easy LUT Import and Export: The app you are choosing should have an easy-to-use interface. The interface should allow you to import and export LUTs quickly. It saves you time and helps you do the editing quicker.
* **Customizable LUTs**: You should be able to create custom LUTs for your content. The app should allow you to adjust colors, contrasts, and saturation settings to make editing easy.
* **Preview Options**: A preview function also is a good option to have in your app. This option allows you to see the LUT effect in your digital media before applying it.
* **Multiple Formats Compatibility**: Furthermore, the app should be compatible with popular video formats like MP4, AVI, and MOV. With this option, you can edit and export your videos in the format you need.
* **Non-Destructive Editing**: Moreover, the app should allow you to edit your footage by keeping the original settings alongside. This feature will not affect the original, letting you revert to the original settings if needed.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: An easy-to-use interface lets you focus on your creativity. A good interface makes the editing process more fluid and easier.

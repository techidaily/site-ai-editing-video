## Tips to Make Cinematic Color Grading

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

## Part 1\. What is Cinematic Color Grading?

The cinematic look is all the rage these days and aims to mimic images captured on real film rather than digitally created. To achieve this effect, film directors use various means from lighting to cinematic color gradation. The latter is a powerful tool for bringing a cool or warm tone to a video and providing smooth color transitions to fall on an image that doesn't look too real but feels emotional.

This kind of post-production processing, which produces beautiful results when used by color magicians, requires a deep understanding of colors and their effect on our psyche and even physiology. It's not enough to watch a color grading video and use a LUT to get where you want. You should at the very least have an understanding of:

* Color wheel
* Color quality
* Color harmony and discord
* Warm and cool colors
* Color context

## Part 2\. Tips to make cinematic color grading

Here are three helpful tips to create cinematic-looking images in DaVinci Resolve.

In my 10-year career as a colorist, I've worked on every type of content imaginable: short, long, commercial, educational, episodic—you name it. And while each of these formats requires its approach, the one constant that spans them all is the client's desire for a cinematic look.

Virtually all of us aspire to more cinematic color, but we often come up short—in part because the term itself has become too broad to effectively target. To focus on the goal, I like to think of "cinematic" as "an image whose key visual properties are consistent with those of printed film."

The print film was the primary medium through which we consumed cinematic images for the first century of filmmaking and is therefore at the very heart of cinematic aesthetics. In this video, I'll show you my top three secrets to achieving this aesthetic quickly and consistently in Davinci Resolve.

### Tips1: Create Color Density

The first secret to film color is to create color density. Another key aesthetic property of film images is that colors can be either highly saturated or highly luminescent but cannot be both.

We can mimic this visual characteristic by identifying strongly saturated colors in our image and using the Hue vs. Lum to reduce their brightness. This simple technique is especially effective on pure primary colors (red, green, and blue).

![create color density](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-1.jpg)

### Tips2: Separation Beats Saturation

The second secret to film color is prioritizing separation over saturation. When you feel like an image lacks overall color or pop, it's all too easy to reach for the saturation knob, but that's not a very cinematic solution.

Instead, try using split toning—pushing cool colors into shadows and warm colors into highlights—to increase tonal separation and add depth to an image. This characteristic is present in virtually every film print and is deeply evocative when applied correctly.

### Tips3: Strong Contrast is Your Friend

The third secret of film colors is a strong contrast. This is not always easy, as a higher contrast look inherently requires more precision with exposure placement. Too often we pump up some contrast, end up with an image that looks blown out or too crisp, and then immediately back away from editing.

However, if you stick with high contrast long enough to improve your exposure, you'll get a very different result and be well on your way to a more cinematic image.

## Part 3\. How to add color cinematic grading by using Filmora?

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an option if you want to easily change the colors of your projects. You may just double-click the media after dragging it onto the editing timeline to change the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue.

Despite its speed, it also allows you to merge, edit audio, divide, rotate, and apply as many cool video effects as you like.

##### Step1Add the media

After installing Wondershare Filmora, click the New Project and Import button to easily find and load your videos.

![add the media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

##### Step2Correct the color \[Basic and Advanced\]

In the timeline, double-click the video editing window. Select the **"Color"** panel and make adjustments.

![color panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

* Contrast: By adjusting this setting, you can control the brightness and color in different parts of the image.
* Saturation: This setting highlights the gray part of the video to a shade. You can adjust it to make the colors of the entire video image appear more saturated or more subdued.
* Brightness: You can change this setting to adjust the overall darkness and lightness of your project.
* Hue: Hue is generally the lightness of a color. Let's say that when red is saturated with white, it creates a shade of pink.
* 3D LUT: 3D lookup tables provide your media with Hollywood movie color sets like the 007 series, Batman, Harry Porter, etc.

Hover over the indicator to adjust the color correction settings. Then left click on it and move the slider. The corresponding value stabilizes after releasing the mouse button.

##### Step3Preview and save the new video

When you are satisfied with your creation, click "Export". Then click the Settings button and save the new videos in different formats in the Format tab. You can also export the video directly to Vimeo or YouTube or burn it to DVD for better preservation.

Filmora's color correction tools will make your videos look natural, more attractive, more vibrant, consistent, and professional.

**Color Correction Presets**

[Color correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) presets help your video achieve an enhanced **cinematic look**. Adjust gives you control over fine-tuning the colors in your shots. You can make various adjustments such as color temperature and exposure.

In the **“Effects > LUT”** tab, you'll see an extensive selection of preset color settings. These include Vignettes, Movie Looks Like Old Movies, and Cinematic 3D LUT effects such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, and Mission Impossible.

![effects lut tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

## What Is Color Finale

The question of which is superior between Color Finale and DaVinci Resolve may have crossed your mind if you're considering upgrading your color grading software. That's very natural, too! These two programs for color grading and color correction are among the best options for intermediate to advanced video editors. And with good cause. But what distinguishes each piece of software? Keep reading to find out.

## 1\. What is color finale?

One of the best color grading and correction programs is Color Finale from Color Trix. It can only be used with Final Cut Pro X at the moment and is downloaded as a plug-in. Therefore, Color Finale is something you should definitely think about employing if you're currently using FCPX to edit your video. Color Finale 2, the most recent edition, is incredibly potent. Compared to the default Final Cut Pro coloring tools, it offers a significantly more detailed coloring experience. It's also shockingly simple to use. After installing it, Color Finale 2 will be accessible under "Video Effects." Simply drag and drop it onto the desired clips to use it. Alternately, make an adjustment layer and apply it to your entire video.

The use of curves, vectors, color wheels, and HSL curves will be available to editors. These can all be utilized in layers. Additionally, rearranging and modifying the layers is simple. The masking and an enhanced LUTs browser are two of Color Finale 2's finest additions. Masks are easy to handle and apply to video clips, and they have a great tracking capability. This makes it simpler for editors to isolate particular colors or sections inside film for intricate coloring.

Additionally, with Color Finale 1, the LUTs browser has been improved. LUTs are now much simpler to go through and preview. Additionally, Color Finale can be shown the location of your computer's favorite LUTs for rapid application. Alternately, you might make your own LUTs and store them for use in later projects. These resources offer a wide range of color options.

The nicest part about it all, though, is how easy Color Finale is to use. Numerous excellent Color Finale instructions may also be found on their YouTube channel. The base version of Color Finale 2 software costs $99 to buy. Alternately, spend $149 once to get the full feature set of Color Finale 2 Pro.

## 2\. Ease of use color finale 2.0

In this division, Color Finale 2 is the undisputed champion. All you have to do to use FCPX editors is download the software. It will be accessible when you launch FCPX the following time. Additionally, editors more experienced with Premiere Pro will still find Color Finale to be simpler to use than DaVinci Resolve. This is due to the fact that DaVinci Resolve uses an entirely unique method than other tools for editing videos. With Resolve, there is a very high learning curve. But with Color Finale 2, you can get started after watching a few tutorials.

## 3\. Features

On the timeline of your Final Cut Pro project, a comprehensive range of professional color grading tools.

**Image quality**: Avoid problems with color management or image compression that could cause degradation between the editing and grading systems.

**Speed**: When compared to the conventional color tools found in Final Cut Pro, the color toolset in this extension has been fine-tuned and their user interface has been optimized for a speedier grading workflow.

**Efficiency**: Keep your project in Final Cut Pro for all of your high-end color grading needs, and there will be no need for round-tripping.

**Transcoder**: Color Finale Transcoder is an FCPX addon that lets you preview, alter, and transcode RAW files. BRAW, ARRIRAW, and CinemaDNG are supported. As Final Cut Pro X natively supports R3D/ProRes RAW files, there's no necessity to support them. Inside the extension, you can change the transcoding codec, color space, output file resolution, delayering mode, and highlight recovery. Color Finale Transcoder lets you change RAW files' color temperature/tint, ISO, and sharpness/detail. Import a preview LUT to see how your film will look.

**Value**: Included are brand new tools for image processing as well as picture analysis - there is no requirement to buy any other plugins.

## 4\. Color Finale 2

The color correction tool known as Color Finale 2 is a plug-in that can only be used with Apple's Final Cut Pro software.

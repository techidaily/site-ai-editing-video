Step3 Please note that motion blur is now a dynamic effect on the image. That means you can add multiple photos and make them into a slideshow with a blur effect transition. Or, press the **“Play”**  icon to preview your photo and pause the clip where you think motion blur works best.

Step4 Click the effect in the timeline to open its settings. Now, play your clip to preview and adjust the parameters as you want to smooth down the motion effect.

Step5 Once satisfied with the outcome, click the "Export" option, go to the **"Local"** tab, select a file format to save the images, and click **"Export"** again to save your project.

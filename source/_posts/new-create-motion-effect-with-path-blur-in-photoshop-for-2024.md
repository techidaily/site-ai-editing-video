## Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?

Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.

The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if/when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.

**1\. History and Current Policies**

Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.

**2\. Accessibility**

Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.

**3\. Deletion**

The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.

## Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?

Google Photos is available for both Android and iPhone smartphones, and as explained earlier, the app can be downloaded from Play Store and App Store respectively. Using the built-in **Google stabilizer video** editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.

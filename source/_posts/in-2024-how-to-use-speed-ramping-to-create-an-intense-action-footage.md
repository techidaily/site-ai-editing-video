## How To Use Speed Ramping to Create an Intense Action Footage

Are you tired of using the same old way to edit your montages? Or do you want to learn to be more professional in your creativity? Don't worry. We got you.

Here you will learn how to take your videos to the next level using speed ramping with a professional video editor- Wondershare Filmora. Moreover, you will get to know two ways to add the effect.

1. Using speed ramping effect and glitch effects.
2. Using the standard speed settings.

These effects can work well for any action sports or dance video. Let's check out about speed ramping effect and ways to add it.

## Part 1\. What is speed ramping?

You've probably seen speed ramping used in suspenseful moments of a basketball video before, like a ball bouncing on the rim or a long buzzer-beating shot.

![cinematic shots of a basketball player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-1.gif)

With speed ramping, we can slow down our most exciting moments to show our audience. And then speed it up again to keep pace with the music or action. So it will give you a smooth transition effect.

## Part 2\. How to enhance action videos with the speed ramping effect?

For example, we'll create an intense basketball video with speed ramping and glitch effects in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Then, to show you how to show off your filming, editing, and basketball skills.

##### Step1 Shot the footage

To edit a montage, you must first capture it correctly. For our example footage, we want to ensure we have set our camera to a higher frame rate for filming this type of video since we're going to use slow motion.

![shot footage from a higher angels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-2.jpg)

**How to capture the best footage?**

You can shoot handheld with a camera or a mobile phone because it allows you to move around your talent and catch some movements and action while giving a shaky camera effect for added suspense. To make evenly balanced videos, you can use a gimbal stabilizer. Here are some tips to get better shots.

* Change camera angles. Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.
* Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.
* Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.
* Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.

Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage. Finally, we will dive into edit tutorials on speed ramping and glitch effects separately for better understanding.

##### Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora

There are two ways to achieve the speed ramping effect. One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.

**Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora**

The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let's start by opening Filmora.

1\. Import media

First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.

![library in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg)

2\. Apply the speed ramping feature

To apply the speed ramping feature, **right-click** on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose **speed ramping** to open the settings window.

![add speed ramping option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-4.jpg)

You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.

![speed templates on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-5.jpg)

The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.

![adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-6.gif)

Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.

After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.

**Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora**

Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.

1\. You can **drag** the video from your library to the timeline. While in the **timeline**, double-click to open the speed menu. Then choose the starting speed you want your video to be with the speed slider.

![uniform speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-7.jpg)

2\. Next, move your playhead to the **point of the video** you want to slow down the speed. Here we will cut and then double-click that clip to open the speed menu again. Change the pace with the speed slider again

![split adjusting the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-8.gif)

Following the above steps, a speed ramping style effect can be created without using the premium feature. Stealthy, isn't it?

##### Step3 Add some intensity to shots with the BCC glitch effect

We will use Boris FX BCC glitch to add some intensity to our video. It is a plug-in built-in Filmora and gives a feeling of chaos to match the action in the video. To apply the BCC glitch effect to the video.

* Click on the effects options in the top bar. For example, a window on the left side showing you the option Boris FX will have a sub-option BCC stylize. Click on it.
* Drag the effect above the place you want it in the timeline.
* Double-click the effect to open its settings.
* A drop-down menu at the top of the screen has tons of glitch presets to try out.
* We are going to scroll down and select shake with motion blur. This preset will use the exact look we want for our basketball video to make the speed ramping more intense.

![present a drop-down menu and reduce the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-9.gif)

* You can change the settings around after choosing a preset. For example, let's turn up the glitch intensity to have our glitch a little more extreme. Moving further, we can change the glitch duration to our specific needs.

Now we can watch our video to see our glitch with the motion blur effect. Isn't it crazy to make a cinematic video by yourself? The speed ramping feature and glitch effects can bring any sports video to the next level.

## An Ultimate Guide to Edit a Music Video: Aspect Ratio and First Cut

Are you planning to edit your music video? Do you need on out how to edit your first music video draft? Editing a music video is a creative task but can be challenging.

One of the key elements of this process is selecting the aspect ratio and making the first cut. In this blog, we will explore these steps in detail, providing important tips and tricks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced editor, get ready to take your music video to the next level. Let's get started.

## Which software will you need?

As we have a lot of software in the market, we must select the right software for high-quality editing. [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an amazing video editing software. It offers a ton of video editing tools. You can add special effects, transitions, and more to make your music video captivating.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

**Note:** Before you start editing your project, make sure that you have a backup. You can copy the project to an external USB or hard drive for a backup.

## Adjust the aspect ratio

The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3\. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.

You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won't shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you'll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.

![some common aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/some-common-aspect-ratios.jpg)

### How to find the width/height of the frame?

Most of the frames that are being shot on the camera are 3424 pixels wide, which is a little under 4k. If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let's suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.

**Formula:** 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)

![1st step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/1st-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you can cancel out the width from the multiplier and the denominator.

\= 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide

![2nd step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/2nd-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you are left with the equation:

\= 3424 pixels high / 2.35

After solving this equation, you will get the answer which is: 1457 pixels high. Let's adjust it on the music video as well, follow the steps given below:

## Assembly

The next step is assembly. You will arrange the shots, clips, and elements in this process and get everything in order. It can be daunting and inspiring for you, as it's a blank canvas you are going to start with. Before editing, you can also get some guidance from your art director.

If your music video has shots of the band performing, drop them off first and sync them with the audio. On the contrary, if you are doing a narrative style, you can arrange the shots according to the story you want to portray.

![graphical text of assembly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-assembly.jpg)

##### Step1Drop the media

You can start by dragging and dropping the music onto the audio timeline. Then you can add the shots of your music video.

![dropping the media onto the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dropping-the-media-onto-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step2Arrange the shots

Arrange the shots according to the storyboard you created and sync them with the audio.

![arranging the shots in order](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/arranging-the-shots-in-order.gif)

##### Step3Add the title

## Send your first draft

The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.

Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.

For first drafts, you don't need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.

### How to add the timer in the music video?

1. Click on **Effects** and search for **Timecode** in the search bar.
2. Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.
3. Extend the timer to the end of the video.
4. Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.

![adding timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-timer.gif)

Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.

## Conclusion

We hope this blog has helped you edit the initials of your music video. By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.

These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.

## Part 3: Three Ways to Use Adjustment Layer in Premiere Pro

You can use the color grading effects and tools to set the exposure, brightness, saturation, and light according to your preference. It will also let you redefine the colors in your video efficiently. To use the adjustment layer for color grading, you can read the below instructions:

Step2 Apply this effect to the adjustment layer and choose your camera to match the color profile. Afterward, you can adjust the saturation, exposure filmstock, and curves according to your choice. You can also increase the vibrancy and hue saturation curves for more enhancement. You can also navigate to the basic correction section to modify the contrast value accordingly.

### 2\. Transition

To merge multiple video clips smoothly and efficiently, transitional effects can assist you. By adding a suitable transition effect, you can make your whole video look clean and cinematic. Moreover, you can use adjustment layers in Premiere Pro to add transition effects to your effect professionally. To do the transition effect, you can proceed to the following instructions:

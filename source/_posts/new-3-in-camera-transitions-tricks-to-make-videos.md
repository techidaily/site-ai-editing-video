## 3 In-Camera Transitions Tricks To Make Videos

You must have seen it in videos when a scene changes to another place or time. How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.

Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.

You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Whip Your Camera

You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera's movement.

**Here is a stepwise guide for you to try**

1. Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.
2. Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.
3. For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.
4. Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.
5. Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.

You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.

The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:

## Fill The Frame

In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.

Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition

1. Plan the two shots you are going to take.
2. Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.
3. In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.
4. The second shot will take place at another time or place.
5. To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.
6. Import both shots into [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
7. Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.

One important thing is to match the color and brightness of the object or subject. It will provide you with much better results. The video attached below explains all the steps of filling the frame.

## Match Cut

In a video, a match cut transitions from one shot to another. During this, the composition of the two shots is matched by action, subject, and subject matter. The goal is to make a visual match between two situations that don't have a direct link. Here are the steps to creating a match-cut transition in your videos.

1. Plan the shot you are going to take.
2. Record the action in the first shot, for example, clapping your hands.
3. Go to another place or scene to record the second shot.
4. Repeat the same action in the second shot.
5. Import both camera shots to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
6. Cut one shot to another when the action is at its peak.

This way, you can smoothly transition from one place or scene to another. There is a video attached below for a better understanding of the steps.

If you are a professional video or image creator, you know what aspect ratio is and why aspect ratio is important. Even people passionate about their cameras and visual art enthusiasts know it. If you are a newbie, Let us make it easy for you. This article will talk about the vertical phone aspect ratio ratio, its definition, types, iPhone vertical video dimensions, etc. We’ll also provide you solid tips on mobile vertical video size and how to create phone vertical videos easily.

03 [Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

"

| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |
| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

## Part 2 Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical

### Image Aspect Ratios

The aspect ratio decides and changes the entire composition and how the audience perceives the image. First, let us see some common image aspect ratios.

![image aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-6.jpg)

● 1:1 Ratio

![1 to 1 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-1.png)

If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.

● 3:2 Ratio

![3 to 2 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-2.png)

Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.

● 5:4 Ratio

![5 to 4 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-14.png)

It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.

### Video Aspect Ratios

![ video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-13.png)

Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.

● 16:9 Ratio

![16 to 9 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-4.png)

If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.

● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)

![9:16 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-3.png)

When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.

The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16\. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.

| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)

![9:16 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-3.png)

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

"

| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |
| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

"

| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |
| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

## Part 2 Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical

### Image Aspect Ratios

The aspect ratio decides and changes the entire composition and how the audience perceives the image. First, let us see some common image aspect ratios.

![image aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-6.jpg)

● 1:1 Ratio

![1 to 1 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-1.png)

If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.

● 3:2 Ratio

![3 to 2 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-2.png)

Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.

● 5:4 Ratio

![5 to 4 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-14.png)

It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.

### Video Aspect Ratios

![ video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-13.png)

Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.

● 16:9 Ratio

![16 to 9 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-4.png)

If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.

● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)

![9:16 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-3.png)

When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.

The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16\. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.

### Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on "OK."

### Solution 3: Enable Render Cache

It’s another solution to fix the **DaVinci resolve slow playback**. Render cache is a file that stores the rendered frames and makes the rendering faster. Start by hitting the “Playback” option and choose “Render Cache.” Then, you’ll see 3 options: None, Smart, and User. You should select "Smart" and let DaVinci Resolve pick one clip to be cached.

![enable render cache slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

### Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature

Every change you make gets saved with the Live Save option in DaVinci Resolve. If your remote drive is linked, this feature can drag the playback speed down. You can disable it for a **DaVinci resolve faster playback**.

Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.

![disable live save feature slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

### Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files

Another solution is to use proxy media during the project editing. Proxy files are small copy files transcoded from a larger, original video file. Get the proxy file to increase the playback and go to your "Media Pool" in DaVinci Resolve. Right-click on the intended file and choose "Generate Proxy Media" from the list.

![use proxy files slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-5.jpg)

### Solution 6: Disable Color Grades

If you are still failing to resolve the slow playback issue on Davinci Resolve, try this fix. Disable color grades and other effects in the first place. To do so, head to the DaVinci Resolve Edit Page. After getting there, press the "Bypass Color Grades and Fusion Effects” button from the top right side. This way, you can surely solve the **DaVinci Resolve slow-down playback** error.

## Part 2: What Makes a Slow-Motion Video Good?

After resolving the **DaVinci Resolve slow playback**, let's continue further editing. Create a slow-motion video to emphasize certain information in the video. It involves technical and creative elements for a good-quality video. You can read this section to understand the points that contribute to a good Slow-motion video.

* **Frame Rate:** Keep the frame rate higher for a good slow-motion video. In this regard, you can use common frame rates such as 60fps, 120fps, and 140fps. Moreover, you should pick video clips that are originally captured in a high frame rate.
* **Shutter Speed:** Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.
* **Resolution:** A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.
* **Editing and Timing:** Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

**_Preparation:_**

First, you need to create a close-up eye video. Although you can do that with your digital camera, a standard smartphone should do it just fine. Just ask a friend or family member to use your phone's rear camera to record your eye centered on the screen. Ensure that the eye is as close as possible and you don't lose focus. The camera should be around 10cm away from your face. And lest I forget, the flash should be ON.

## How to Create an Eye-zoom Transition

##### Step 1 Align the video clips on Filmora

After recording a close-up eye video, add it on Wondershare Filmora and duplicate it. Alternatively, you can add the video to the first and second tracks.

![align the video clips on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 Add a freeze frame to the video

Next, we want to add a freeze frame to the section where the eye opens fully. To do that, select the second video track and place the playhead where the eye is fully open. After that, right-click the video track, then choose the **Add Freeze Frame** option.

![add a freeze frame to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-2.jpg)

Now trim the first video track from where the freeze frame starts on the second video. Also, cut the second video track to leave only the freeze frame

##### Step 3 Add a masking effect to the eye

With the two video tracks ready, it's time to apply a masking effect. Tap the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and then find the **Shape Mask** under the utility section. Now drag and drop the effect to the freeze frame.

![add a masking effect to the eye](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-3.jpg)

Double-click on the freeze frame clip to adjust the Shape Mask on the preview screen. Ensure the mask reveals the eye pupil only and check the **Invert Mask** box. Also, set the **Feather** number to 10.

![double-click on the freeze frame clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-4.jpg)

##### Step 4 Add the transition video

Next, add the video you want to edit with an eye-zoom effect next to the first video track. Preview the video, and you'll notice your new video playing inside the eye mask.

With that done, move the playhead to the start of the freeze frame video and double-click the video clip to launch the settings window. Click the **Animation** tab before clicking **Customize** to see the keyframe settings. Tap the **Add** button to add a keyframe. Then, add a few frames using the playhead before clicking Add. But because we're zooming in, increase the scale to 160%. You can also add the rotation and position.

![add the transition video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-5.jpg)

After setting the second keyframe, move the playhead to the right and add the third keyframe. This time, increase the scale number to 400%, as well as the rotation and position. Now preview the video, and you'll notice the rotating eye-zoom effect.

![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-4.png)

##### Step4 Adding the Magic Imitating Effect

After these initial setups, you must add the effects from filmstock to our clips. These are pre-made presets of different clipart and graphics, executing unique movements and effects. For their introduction in the video, read along with the following procedure:

* After dragging and dropping the clip onto the first track on the timeline, go to the stickers tab on the top left ribbon, click it, and scroll down to the filmstock dropdown.

![finding the magic effects from filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-5.png)

* From there, open the Bling Bling Effect Pack and choose the bling light effect of your liking. Then, drag and drop that effect onto the second video track on the timeline.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-6.png)

* Adjust the element's scale according to your required size from the editing menu after double-clicking the element.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-7.png)

* Move the **playhead** to locate the brightest moment of the element. Now, right-click and select **Add Freeze Frame.** It will freeze the element at that exact frame

![adding freeze frame to the element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-8.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** ensure the element's freeze frame starts when the anticipated magic wand light is glowing.

![adjusting the start of effect on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-9.png)

* Adjust the duration to match the end of the two clips on the timeline.

![bringing the ends of the two frames together](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-10.png)

##### Step5 Adding Keyframe Movement to the Element

It is time to add some keyframes. Once you have successfully added the effect element onto your editing workspace, you have to make it do the magic. Attaching the magic effect bling to the base (background) video is like painting your canvas for the magic to occur. It is a crucial step for bringing out those Harry Potter-like magical feats. Continue scrolling for step-by-step instructions.

* Double-click the effect element and open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-11.png)

* In the basic tab, as visible above, **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then **adjust** the element's position at the wand's tip on the preview window.

![positioning the element at the desired location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-12.png)

##### Step6 Detailing the Effect Through Keyframing

This part of the procedure is iterative. You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.

* Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand's tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element's position onto the wand's tip.

![eeadjusting the elements position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-13.png)

Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.

If you've seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you've probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.

## Purpose of Montage

Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project. Even though these types of movies have become a common genre, there's a list of reasons why this is popular in movies today.

* Montage has several uses in movies. Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm. These different uses of Montage do come with their styles, but they all share a few common traits.
* They're often used to condense periods of storytime into much smaller but more entertaining segments. The word montage is French for "to construct from many parts ."Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.
* This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them. A great example of a montage was used in Rocky when Rocky was training for his fight with Apollo Creed.
* A montage allows filmmakers to explore a theme using several sequential shots that can't be covered in a single shot.

## Best 8 Animated Video Makers

Animations can be a great way to get your work to stand out and the best animated video maker can help you get this effect very easily. Here, we will be helping you find the best way to create animated videos for your particular project.

It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.

Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.

## When to Use an Animated Video Maker

There are several reasons why you would want to create an animated video, rather than use traditional video solutions. The following are the most important from a digital marketing standpoint;

**Improve Conversion and Sales**

Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.

**Increase Brand Awareness**

Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.

**Generate Online Leads**

Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.

**Explain Complex Processes**

It can be very difficult to try to explain very complex ideas such as the mechanical aspect of a certain tool using words. But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video.

So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

1. Navigate to the "Edit" page.
2. Select the tab "Media Pool."
3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

It's best to link the soundtrack (music, sound effect, or background music) to the relevant video once you've adjusted the audio file.

Here's how to connect audio and video in a timeline:

1. Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" to toggle both the video and audio.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."
3. The sound and visual are now both connected.

Thus, you can rest guaranteed that the audio will follow your movie wherever it goes. There will be no issues with out-of-sync!

### **How Do You Link Many Audio and Video Files Together in DaVinci Resolve?**

Several video and audio segments can be linked together to form a single one. You can rearrange them anywhere in the timeline, and they will not be out of sync.

This is how you connect many clips:

1. By holding down the "Ctrl" or "Cmd" key, you can choose all the video and audio clips you want.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcut keys "Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L".
3. Now, all your video or audio files are linked together.

### **Is Any Music Available to Use for Editing?**

Understanding copyright law can be complicated. It's best to use free music for video editing if you don't want to be accused of copyright violation.

Additionally, you can purchase two licenses to avoid copyright concerns. The producer controls the synchronization license, and the master license to use the song recording is managed by the publishing company.

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

### **Is There Any Free Music in DaVinci Resolve?**

DaVinci Resolve does not include any free music; however, it does include royalty-free sound effects noise. To get started, you can download and install the available sound package.

### **What Software Provides Free Music?**

The Audio Collection in Wondershare Filmora has over 50 royalty-free audio tracks for videos, with more to come.

For video production, you can acquire free background music.

In addition, Filmora has 25 sound effects, including animal sounds, video game sounds, and beeps. With Filmora, you may use more advanced editing features like keyframing, background noise elimination, cut, trim, crop, PIP effects, green-screen effects, and more to add free-choice music to your film.

Filmora will enhance the appeal of your video by giving free background music. You may also tweak the background sound, such as speeding up and slowing down, fade-in and fade-out.

![unlink-audio-video-davinci-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/unlink-audio-video-davinci-1.jpg)

So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## Add Text to Video on Computer

While online tools like VEED can come in handy when you want to make simple changes to a video, you will often find that they don't have the necessary features to customize the text in various ways. For that, we recommend Wondershare Filmora, a desktop editing suite that has a lot of useful features.

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) combines its wealth of editing features and a simple user interface to make it one of the most effective video editors in the market. Here's how you can add text to any video using Filmora.

Step1Download and install Wondershare Filmora onto your computer. Open the program and then click on the “Import” button to start. You can also just drag and drop the video to the main window to open it.

Step2Once the video is open in Filmora, you will need to drag it to the timeline panel before you can start to edit it.

![start to edit video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-text-to-video-4.jpg)

Step3Click on the “Titles” tab at the top to open the text and title presets that you will need to add text to the document. Filmora offers more than 200 text effects to choose from. Just double-click on one of the presents to select it and then the preview window to see it in real-time.

![click on titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-text-to-video-5.jpg)

Step4If you like the preset that you have selected, place the cursor on the position in the timeline where you would like to add the text and then drag and drop the title track above the video in the timeline.

![add text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-text-to-video-6.jpg)

Step5If you would like to change the duration of the text simply drag the edge of the timeline until you get the length that you desire. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) also allows you to edit and customize the text. To do that, double-click on the “Title” time frame to get some customization options.

Step6Once you are happy with all the changes you have made, click on “Export” and choose an output format to save and export your video.

**Benefits of loop TikTok videos**

TikTok loop includes the use of videos with a similar rhythm to create a special atmosphere that attracts people to participate and share them. The videos are made by those people who know how to make the video attractive to the public. The most used technique of communication is through a video that is shared on social networks like Facebook and Instagram.

One reason why loop TikTok videos are so popular is that they're really easy to use. You don't need to be an expert in video editing to create them. All you need is a smartphone. Also, loop TikTok videos are a great way to share a moment with your friends and followers. Plus, they can be posted on the go and shared instantly.

This article will guide you about the loop TikTok video.

## Part 2: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on a Computer

Time-lapse video is a type of video that allows you to see a huge amount of change in a very short time. You can see it on all social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. It can be used to make all kinds of videos, from simple scenes of nature to complex events. The first time-lapse video was made in France in 1872 by Léon Bouly.

There are a lot of steps to make a time-lapse video on a computer.

Step1 You need to download the free software that comes with the camera. You can find it on the manufacturer's website or through a search engine.

Step2 You'll want to plug in your phone's charging cable and plug it in so that it can stay charged while filming.

Step3 You'll need to find somewhere quiet where you can set up your camera and tripod. If possible, try to do this outside so that there's no worry about getting dust or dirt on your lens.

Step4 Set up your phone so that it will record once every hour for an hour straight. This will give you enough time for each frame of video before switching over to the next one after an hour has passed.

Step5 Start recording!

**Why we should make a time-lapse video on a computer?**

Time lapses are also useful for showing how something changes over time. For example, if you want to show how an environment changes from day to night, or how a plant grows from seedlings into mature plants after being watered and nourished by sunlight, these videos would be perfect for demonstrating this change in real-time.

You can also create time-lapse videos that show the growth of plants or flowers over time. You could use this method to demonstrate how plants grow from seedlings into fully grown trees or bushes. You could even try creating a time-lapse video showing the growth of a weed from the seedling stage into full bloom with its seeds spread out across the ground below it!

You can make your videos more fun and engaging. By recording multiple angles at the same time, you can capture all the exciting moments, like when something unexpected happens. Or when something amazing turns out to be a total disaster in real life. You can easily share with friends and family members who might not be able to come to see you in person.

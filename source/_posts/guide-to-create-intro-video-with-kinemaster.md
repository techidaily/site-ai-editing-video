## Part 2\. Adding Effects Before Recording

Many people are hesitant to record a TikTok video with more than one filter effect applied. You've probably seen that a lot of well-known makers create videos that combine many different effects. Actually, the procedure is rather easy. You may apply as many filters as you'd like on the TikTok app while recording time stamps one at a time only! It is not feasible or the option is not presently accessible on the app if you wish to apply many effects at once.

**Steps to Add Effects to TikTok Videos Before Recording:**

![tap create new video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-create-new-video-tiktok.jpg)

![start recording video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/start-recording-video-tiktok.jpg)

## Part 3\. Adding Effects After Recording

Forgot to use a filter effect before to beginning your recording? Not to worry! On the Preview page, you may also apply a filter to your clips. By selecting Visual under Effects after recording or uploading your TikTok video, you may also add some lovely dynamic filter effects. You may achieve that by saving the films to your camera roll after applying each effect individually to the same clip. then launch the app's video recorder, add the previously recorded video, and choose a new filter to apply to the video clip.

**Steps to Add Effects to TikTok After Recording:**

Step1 The first step is to launch the program on your phone and touch the "+" icon. Simply choose a filter effect for your movie by going right to the Filters section here.

![tap add icon tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-add-icon-tiktok.jpg)

Step2 The filters button, which is indicated by three circles, must be tapped in the second stage. You may choose the TikTok effect you wish to use once all of the effects are shown on the screen.

![choose effects tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-effects-tiktok.jpg)

Step3 You have access to a wide variety of effects once you enter the effects gallery. Select the effect that best suits your video and that you prefer. After making your decision, leave the effects gallery and upload the recording.

![publish and post video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/publish-and-post-video-tiktok.jpg)

## Part 4\. Add Filter on Video in TikTok

You may apply the filters after you film the movie, just as you do with the effects. You just need to visit visual. There is no way to identify the filter that your favorite TikToker used on his video on TikTok. Don't worry, they often include the effect they employ in the hashtag or description, so you are still welcome to utilize it. To hunt for filter effects on TikTok, you might request a search function.

**Steps to Add Filter on Videos in TikTok:**

Step1 Click the "+" symbol in the bottom menu's center after launching the TikTok app on your phone. Press the "+" button to start your camera before applying a specific filter.

![add filter tiktok videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-filter-tiktok-videos.jpg)

Step4 You may apply the filter to your video after you have officially made your decision. After doing this, leave the filter gallery and begin recording your video. Now that all of these procedures have been completed, you are able to capture your video with the effect on it.

![apply filters to videos tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-filters-to-videos-tiktok.jpg)

## The Bottom Line

Filters on TikTok work similarly to filters on other social media applications. However, there is no option or function in the TikTok app that allows you to look for a filter effect under the Filters or Effects tab. However, since most TikTok users constantly upload videos with any filter and strive to put the filter's name and hashtags on the films, you may search for some videos with the identical filter. Your films will get flair and individuality thanks to this simple technique, which also gives certain filters a chance to catch on as trends.

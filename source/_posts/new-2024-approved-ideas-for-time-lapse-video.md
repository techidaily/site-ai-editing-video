## Ideas for Time-Lapse Video

Are you thinking of stepping out of the familiar world of still photography to make a time-lapse video?

As you all know I am a fan of travel videos and time-lapse video because why not? There is no denying that time-lapse techniques are a perfect medium for travel videos.

In this article will give you some ideas to get started in time-lapse video or photography and let's define what a time-lapse video and what makes them great.

## What is Time Lapse

Time-lapse is a creative filming and video editing technique that manipulates how the frame rate is captured. Frame rate is the number of images or frames appearing in a second of video. In most videos, the frame rate and playback speed are the same. In a time-lapse video, the frame rate is stretched out far more: when played back at average speed, time appears to be sped up.

Time-lapse can also refer to a camera's shutter speed (How long the camera's shutter remains open to let light in). A similar effect to time-lapse is found in stop-motion videos. The subject doesn't move but seems to be in motion because it's manually or repeatedly moved and then photographed. The images are then strung together to create video-like motion.

![time lapse car video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/time-lapse-car-video.jpg)

## How Time-lapse Works

Time-lapse photography is a technique that records a scene or objects that change at a slow speed and turns it into a video that plays back at high speed.

Most time-lapse videos are projected at a speed of 30 frames per second. The frame rate of your time-lapse video can be determined in the editing process, but you will need to account for how quickly the action is taking place in the camera or your video will be a collection if stills. Consider what FPS you want to use in your video. You need to capture that many frames per second to create a time-lapse effect. If you're shooting a 10 second video at 30fps, you should end up with 300 images.

What equipment needed for time-lapse video?

Time-lapse photography requires only a few special pieces of equipment.

**1\. Camera / Smartphones**

Technically any point and shoot camera or smartphone can be used for time-lapse video, the easiest ones to work are DSLR or mirrorless cameras, some even have an in camera intervalometer (often called a time-lapse feature or time-lapse mode), which means you'll need less equipment to take great time-lapse video.

**2\. High-capacity Memory Card**

For the best results, shoot in RAW format which takes image in the highest resolution with actual image dimensions. You'll need to prepare for very large RAW file sizes, so bring multiple high capacity memory cards.

**3.Tripod**

A tripod is essential to time-lapse video or photography, because the camera needs to stay perfectly still in order to emphasize the steady movement of your subject and to avoid overlay blurry videos or photos.

## How to Capture Times-lapse Video

A technique that was once found only in video editing software is now on nearly every mobile device. So what's the best way to make an amazing time-lapse video that stands apart from the rest? That depends on how you plan to capture the footage.

**Smartphones:**

Most phones have a time-lapse feature in their camera app. Be advised: you will need to record for an extended period, as 30 minutes equates to about 10 seconds of footage. Like a video camera, you will need a tripod to steady your shots. On an iPhone, you can either film a time-lapse or stitch one together from your photo collection, all without a video editor.

**DSLR Camera**

For DSLR camera you'll need a tripod and a device called intervalometer. The first is essential to make sure your camera is stationary and is taking photos if the exact same location without moving anywhere.

An intervalometer, or a remote control, is a device that allows you to set your camera to hit the shutter button at an interval of your choice. In other words, an intervalometer is there to let you rest aside without having a manually click the shutter button yourself.

**Here are some video ideas for your time-lapse**

* Ice melting
* Flower and plants
* Clouds moving
* Sunrise/sunset
* Star movement
* Traffic movement

**Ice melting**

Time-lapse is an ideal way to capture the mesmerizing transition between water and ice. Even something as simple as watching ice melt can be appealing.

**Flower and plants**

Flowers and plants can be beautiful to behold, but their transformation from seed to adult plant is often absolutely breathtaking. If you have an indoor plant that you are about to start growing you can set up a camera on a mount of a tripod at the angle with which you want to capture. As you water, groom or fertilize on a regular schedule, you can incorporate taking a photograph at the same time.

**Clouds moving**

The clouds can provide a whole host of phenomena that will both enlighten the observer to the complexities of the atmosphere or cosmos but will also provide a beautiful spectacle in the daytime, the movement of clouds can be quite spell binding and the rolling in of rain or a thunderstorm can be particularly interesting.

**Sunrise/Sunset**

Shooting a sunset is more difficult. The light changes during the selected time period.

To overcome this, use remote control camera software. This can be compensated by increasing the ISO or decreasing the shutter speed as the light dims.

![shoot sunset timelapse video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-sunset-timelapse-video.jpg)

**Star movement**

At night, if the sky is clear and you are in an area dark enough, the stars in the sky can provide a beautiful time-lapse as the stars move in relation to the observer due to earths rotations.

**Traffic movement**

The interconnectedness of vehicles moving along busy roads, trailing light patterns, and the general hustle and bustle of city life can be brought to you in a dynamic way via time-lapse videos.

It is the smooth impression of motion which time-lapse is able to produce that can emphasize and help to invigorate something as ordinary and everyday as the coming and going of traffic.

## How To Make A Do-It-Yourself Video

Wondering how YouTubers make their own video from scratch? Want to open a YouTube channel and you don’t know how to start? Then, in this article; I’ll explain you the details. Please stay with me.

If you love to speak in front of the camera as if anyone is watching you, and if you’re someone with low self-esteem like me, and you want to develop your self-confidence, then you’re on the right track. People nowadays look for something that can add spice to their life like vlogging. But first, you need to know the reasons why you're opening a YouTube channel in the first place. Have a me time and ask yourself what do you want to share with your target audiences.

Things that can be of great influence to someone who badly needed it (in a positive way of course.) People nowadays search answers to their questions on YouTube. It is the second largest search engine next to Google and because of the YouTubers who give fuel to it, people around the globe watch it on a daily basis, I’m sure of it.

And now that you’ve already know what you want to share outside the world, you just need your vlogging equipment's.

## Part 1\. Things That You Need when You Want to Start Vlogging

A smart phone and a tripod will do. You don’t need to have all those professional vlogging equipment's if you’re a new YouTuber. Each and every smart phone now can record a high-definition resolution. I started with my Samsung S6 and a pile of books as my tripod. Silly me! But you need to be resourceful. As the time went by, I bought a tripod from JOOM (an online store just like Ali Express). Very cheap and it last long. You also need a video editor for post editing. You don’t want to upload a raw video on YouTube without anything in it. It will be dull and boring.

## Part 2\. Reasons Why You Need a Video Editor?

### 1\. Videos Are Impactful

While pictures can tell a thousand words, video tells a thousand more. On your videos, your audiences can see your feelings about a particular topic, and with the correct techniques and editing secrets, you can effectively tell someone or many people a message you want to get across.

So, if you want something across, putting out your message or promotion through a video to these people makes sense. And it does not have to be that hard. You might say people only want to watch good looking videos. Well, yes, but using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video editing software can let your video look more professional.

### 3\. You Don’t Need a Fortune to Produce Videos

That's right. If you have a video editor installed on your phone, you’re ready to go. I started to edit my first ever video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) go. It’s very handy and easy to use for a beginner like me before. And it has lot of features that you can put in your video, like cool titles, transitions and even stickers. If you want to produce your video using your computer or a laptop, you can definitely use Wondershare Filmora.

## Part 3\. Preparations for a Vlog

I take down notes when preparing a video, I used to write the things that I need to say. Things that I mostly want to highlight when expressing my thoughts to everyone who will watch it.

![do it yourself video prepare](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/do-it-yourself-video-prepare.jpg)

I put myself a little make up on when producing a video, it makes me feel more confident to speak in front of my virtual audiences because I know that I looked presentable in any way.

Now we need to set our do-it-yourself like studio (it can be your room; it can be in the living room or anywhere that you can see that has a good background) or you can use a green backdrop and just make wonders in the post editing.

During these days, I’m filming using my Canon GX7 Mark II and it’s a result of my first ever YouTube salary. When you’re into vlogging, at some point you need to upgrade your vlogging equipment's. I know it will take time, but you can do it.

After you finished a vlog/video, you need to edit it and that’s the most exciting part for me, at least. Put your teaser, your intro, the body of the video itself and don’t forget the outro.

![do it yourself video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/do-it-yourself-video-editing.jpg)

## Conclusions

If you want to open up a YouTube Channel, then do it now. Maybe you’ll feel down because people around you will not support you from the beginning and that’s the cruel part of being a YouTuber. As the saying goes by, “birds of the same feather, flock together”; people with the same passion as you can understand all your endeavors. Don’t always think of the money that you will receive afterwards because that brings pressure and you’ll push yourself to the limit until you’ll feel and say “enough is enough”. Just do your own thing and the rest will follow. And if you think that you have something to offer to someone out there virtually, then don’t think twice. We only live once, make the most out of it.

And if you’re looking for the best video editor for Personal Computers this year 2022, choose [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and you’ll be thrilled. Trust me, I’ve been there. Happy editing!

## Want to Give a Bold and Colorful Look to Your Ad or Abstract Art Project? This Quick and Easy Tutorial Teaches How to Create a Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Risograph printing is a digital printing process that combines the best features of offset and screen printing used by many small print shops and design studios to provide trendy vibes and a classic look to the images.

If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you **create a risograph effect in Photoshop** quickly!

Without further delay, let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial!

## What Is Risograph Effect?

Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop [in the later part of this article](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.

Risograph was created in **1986** by a Japanese company called **Riso Kagaku Corporation.** It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.

The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph's unique charm and distinct look.

The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.

## How To Use Photoshop To Create Risograph Effect

The dual-tone effect is a technique in the risograph effect that combines two or more overlapping images to give a more vibrant look to the final project or emphasize the critical concept, information, or idea.

To create a dual-tone risograph effect in Photoshop, do the following steps.

Step1 To create a dual-tone risograph effect, add another subject to the canvas and set the blending mode to **Multiply.** Also, change its opacity to blend the two issues well. Make sure to turn the subject to **Smart Object** by right-clicking on the object's layer and selecting **"Convert to Smart Object."** Adjust the position of the subject on the previous one.

![add another subject to the canvas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-subject-to-smart-object-in-photoshop-to-create-risograph-effect.png)

Finally, your dual-tone effect is created in Photoshop!

### How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes

In this part, let’s see how to use the layer modes to add another subject to the canvas and blend it with the previous ones.

Step1 Place the new subject on the canvas and set the layer mode to **Multiply** by pressing the **“Ctrl + Shift + N”** and selecting **“Multiply”** from the drop-down menu in the new pop-up window. Click **“Ok”** to apply your changes.

To adjust the size of the object, click **“Edit”** from the top toolbar, and select **“Transform.”** From the drop-down menu, select **“Scale.”** Use the handles to make the object smaller or larger.

Step2 Click the **“Move”** icon from the left menu and drag the object to set its position. Now, copy and clip the **Gradient mode** from the main subject to the new one.

Step3 Apply the **Level** and **Filter Galler** to the new object (Same settings as the main subject). That’s it. You’ve successfully blended images using the layer mode.

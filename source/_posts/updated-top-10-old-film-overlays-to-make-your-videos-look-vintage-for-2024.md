Step 1: Open Filmora and remove all the pieces of the footage. Then arrange the rest of the footage as you see fit. Click on "Effects" on the upper left corner of your screen and then on "Filters". Click on the Old Video effect and then drop it. After you add the filter on the segment of your video, you can drag the end of it to cover the whole duration of the movies. Click twice on the filter if you want to adjust the filter settings. Enter the desired values on the "Fade" parameter, "Frequency", and "Alpha" options. Press "OK", and this step is concluded.

Step 3: In Filmora, you can add sepia tone rise or sun-kissed filters to your video. You are able to add desaturated filters while keeping colors like blue and green and with that create the old film style. If you want more brown and red tones, you can use the Sun-Kisser filter that highlights those colors. Adjust the filters with the alpha slider to change intensity.

![old film overlay 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png)

Step 4: Under the black and white subcategory, you can find Ash and Willow filters. What these do is desaturate the contrast or exposure values as well as preset brightness and bring an older tone to your videos.

Step 5: You can correct any kind of filter. With the Advanced Color Correction Tab, you can navigate through features like Preset and Adjustment and desaturate your video. By clicking on the "Preset tab," you can open a larger variety of presets, including the Old Film and Black & White presets.

## Part 4: Pro Tips to Create Stunning Retro Video

You can make your video look retro with a few simple tips:

* Use several vintage apps like Retro VHS, 8mm Camcorder, and others.
* Keep low highlights and low contrasts.
* Keep low saturation and control the hue, saturation, and luminance of your video.
* Film Overlays. With this, you can bring the mood just right. If you add a soft light overall to start with, it will instantly look slightly more vintage.
* By decreasing contrast, you are darkening your videos and giving them a grainier old look.
* If you bring up the black levels, you will leave more space for other tones to shine and turn the mood around your videos.
* In contrast, if you bring down the whites in your videos, making even the brightest colors turn grey.

### Conclusion

There are various ways to turn your videos into old relics. Using Filmora, you have a powerful tool in your hands to change any desired media, and with this step-by-step guide, you will get there in no time.

Editing is cutting and accumulating the selected clips to tell the story better. Editing consists of adding sound effects, transitions, and other visual elements to help it view excellent results.

![hitfilm how to edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hitfilm-how-to-edit.jpg)

You have to set up the editor timeline and start importing clips to edit your clips. Use the editor tools like roll, slip, drag, selection, ripple, and others to customize your edit.

* Choose the Set in point button from the point where you want to start the clip. In the timeline, you will notice an orange section representing the part of the clip you want to play.
* Now, skip through, and decide where you want to end the clip. You have to click the Set-out button. You can alternatively use the I and 0 keys as shortcuts.
* Once you get your selected start and endpoint, you can drag down the portion of the video into the timeline. This time, you can get a message that shows the editor settings are different from the adding clip. It is your choice how you want to keep your settings.
* If you find the selected set of a good standard, you can move forward and select “Yes” to ensure that your project gets changed into that setting.
* In the viewer section, you will get to view the final outlook of the video. Here, on the downside of the timeline, you can click on the Zoom bar to see things in detail. Your previews will depend on the selected settings that you have made beforehand.
* If you want to change your default setting, you can come to the hamburger icon for tracking and changing the size of the video to different ones.
* **Add a clip to the timeline:** Position the play head at the timeline point where you want to start the clip, and then hit the insert clip button.

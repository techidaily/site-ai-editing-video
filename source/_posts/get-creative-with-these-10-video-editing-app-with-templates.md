## 5 Tips for Faster Editing in Filmora

It’s an indisputable fact that editing is an essential aspect of video creation, and it’s what brings your initial idea to life. However, it can be very daunting and time-consuming, especially when working on a video project containing lots of footage.

In this post, we will walk you through the five best tips that can come in handy to operate fast and smoothly while editing videos of any size. All you just need is the Filmora video editor. You don’t even require technical knowledge.

## 1\. Organize your Media

Since a video project usually has various elements, keeping track of them can take a lot of work. So, the first editing step should be to organize the files so that it is easy to follow them. To do that, you need to do the following;

**Create a Folder for Each Media File in your Project**

Creating folders involves sorting your video files into various categories, thus making it easy for you to look into specific files and find the missing ones quickly when you need them. For example, you can create a folder for A roll, B roll, Photos, Audio, Sound FX, Music, and Drone Footage. Follow the steps below to see how you can use [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create a folder for each file in your video project;

Step1 Launch Filmora and click Create Project.

![launch filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 Navigate to the bottom left corner before the Timeline > click the Folder icon from there, as shown in the image below;

![navigate to the bottom left corner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Click on the folder icon until you reach the total number of folders you need to categorize your video files.

Right-click on each folder and name it accordingly.

![click on the folder icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-3.jpg)

After you name each folder, use the Import button to upload each video files you need to edit your video.

![use the Import button to upload each video files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-4.jpg)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** since the media files you import into your project get the name associated with the code given by the source, it becomes hard to capture a specific file while editing. You need to rename each of the elements you imported for easier access.

Step4 Rename all imported files. To rename your imported files, right-click on them to add a preferred name. Then, click Rename from the pop-up list to name the files.

## 2\. The Use of Proxies

Another tip that enhances a quick editing process is the use of proxies. Proxies can be described as low-resolution versions of your video files. So, if you’re working on video files that drag back playback speed, like 4K footage, you can create a proxy to enable your PC to handle the file seamlessly.

A tool like Filmora editor can help create proxies of your video file flawlessly. You just have to follow the steps below;

Step1 Locate the large video file you imported to Filmora and right-click it. Then, select Create Proxy File.

![locate the large video file to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 You should see the proxy icon at the bottom right corner of your video once it completes. This takes only a few minutes.

![finish proxy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Drag-n-drop the video to the timeline and perform the necessary editing. Afterward, use the Export button to save the file to your PC.

![click on the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-3.jpg)

## 3\. Keep Your Videos and Audio Tracks Organized

This is similar to our first tip, and fortunately, the Filmora video editor facilitates this kind of operation quickly and easily. It involves organizing video and audio clips in the timeline while editing. For instance, use video track #1 for graphics or text, #2 for your B roll, and #1 for the main footage taken.

You will also do the same for Audio, for instance, Audio track #1 for music, Audio track #2 for dialogues, and many more. This will allow you to edit various clips simultaneously, making the editing process faster and easier. Here are the steps to use this tip;

Step1 Click on the Add icon at the left side of the Timeline and select Add Video Track or Add Audio Track to add more timelines for your clips.

![click on the add icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-audio-and-video-tracks-1.jpg)

Step2 Drag-n-drop the video clips and audio clips to the relevant timeline.

![drag-n-drop the video clips and audio clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-audio-and-video-tracks-2.jpg)

## 4\. Keyboard Shortcuts

These are commands on the keyboard of your pc that will enable you to edit your projects easily and quickly. Various options can be available by keying in specific orders rather than going through a long process using the mouse. This knowledge can be a real time-saver when handling projects. To get more enlightened on the setup in Filmora, follow the steps outlined below;

Step1 Open Filmora and click File from the top side.

Step2 Select Keyboard Shortcuts from the drop-down list.

![select keyboard shortcuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-keyboard-shortcuts-filmora-1.jpg)

Step3 The new pop-up window on your PC screen will display all shortcuts you can employ while using Filmora, and the interesting part is that you can customize the shortcut keys to your preference. Moreover, you can freely switch keyboard shortcuts between Filmora, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.

Step4 For clicking CTRL+ALT+N will allow you to create a new folder for your file.

## 5\. Edit in Stages

Our final tip is to edit in stages. Yes, it is necessary to edit in stages when dealing with editing work. This helps to limit the time you spend on a project. In the beginning, you should do a rough cut. You can begin by editing the A roll at first and then move on to edit the B roll, moving on to the Sound FX, Music, Graphics, and Color Correction, and then reviewing the entire project before exporting it.

In case while editing the A roll, you find something that requires a quick fix in its audio, focus on it and, if possible, use a marker icon to describe it. This will help you not get confused once you get to the Audio stage. See the steps to use Filmora to do this below;

Step1 Firstly, focus on your video footage. Move them to the required timeline.

![focus on your video footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-in-stages-1.jpg)

Step2 Next, move your B-roll to the relevant timeline. Then, apply the required editing.

Step3 Afterward, move drag-n-drop the audio clips to the timeline and apply the needed edits.

![move drag-n-drop the audio clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-in-stages-2.jpg)

Repeat the process for different operations in stages until you finish.

## Backup and Organize Your Tons of Footage in Minutes

Backing up your data is deemed significantly necessary among video editing communities. Files get corrupted easily. Having a backup drive can save your day and countless hours. You can back up your data any way you deem fit. However, it will do you right if you follow the advice of professionals.

The article is written explicitly after due consideration and suggestions from the professional video editor. You can follow the steps in it to make backup files. Let us start with very straightforward steps to help you understand the professional way of backing up and organizing your footage.

## Part 1\. Back Up Your Files

Backing up your files gives you peace of mind. If one file is lost, the whole project becomes vulnerable to failure. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure the protection of files. The best way to protect the files from any misfortune is to back them up.

Remember, there is no specific way to back up your files. Depending on the project's requirements, you can do that differently. The following steps will light up how you can back up your files.

##### Step1Back up your files in two different places

It is crucial to do that. If one backup drive corrupts, you have the second option. It gives you an opportunity to back up files.

* You can make two different external backup hard drives.

![back up your data on two different external drives](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-two-different-external-drive.jpg)

![back up your data on an internal and external hard drive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-an-internal-and-external-hard-drive.jpg)

##### Step2Make specific folders for each purpose of the video

The next step is how you back up your files properly and safely. Make separate folders for the different formats you are importing in your drive. Always use the primary source to make a copy of your files.

Follow the steps below to understand how to back up your files in two drives.

* Create a folder in your drive.
* Name it. You can name it according to the given format. The choice is yours.

![format for naming your file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/format-for-naming-your-file.jpg)

* Your backup folder is created.
* Make new folders based on the files that are imported into the file. We are making two folders for the project, 01 Footage, and 02 Audio.  
  * 01 Footage is for the original footage.  
  * 02 Audio is for audio files provided by the music artist.

![make folders for different formats in the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/make-folders-for-different-formats-in-the-video.jpg)

##### Step3Repeat the same process in your second backup drive

* Make the same folders and sub-folders in your secondary backup drive.

## How to Add a Custom Transition to OBS

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.

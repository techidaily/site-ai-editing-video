## Add Effects to Video Online

Recording a video is work half done. Editing the video is an equally important part. Apart from trimming out unnecessary parts and joining trimmed video clips, you have to add video effects to your video clips so that your video looks interesting. In fact, video effects are responsible for enhancing the beauty of the recorded video clips in the eyes of the viewers.

There is a wide range of video effects available to use on your videos, and turn them from ordinary video clips to stunning videos. The best part is that you do not have to install a video editor application on your device to apply video effects. This is because you can add effects to video online and that too for free of cost. We will discuss all the ways to add effects to your videos online that everyone can use conveniently.

## Part 1\. Popular Video Effects to Use Online

If you are wondering which effects to add to your videos to make them look extra-ordinary, here is the list of the popular video affects you can apply to your videos online.

Sparkle Effect – When you add sparkle effect to your video, you will see tiny flashes of lights like twinkling stars around the subject of the video or the entire frame of the video. There can also be stars shinning and glittering to enhance the glamour factor of the subject in your videos.

Snow Effect – When you add snow effect to video online, you get to see animated snowflakes falling across the video like snowfall in the winter. You need a proper scene to add snow effect, and it represents romantic and joyous mood in a video.

Speed Change Effect – Speed change effect is extremely common whereby you can slow down and fasten up the video playing speed as per your requirements. Slow-motion video is a part of speed change effect to emphasize a scene for a long period of time.

Reverb Effect – In this video effect, you see a particular scene reverberating, especially when the subject goes into imagining things and recalling memories. You can add reverb to video online when there is a jump cut scene in your video to smoothen the transition.

Transition Effect – Transition effect is a special type of video effects that you insert when you are making a transition from one scene to another. Transition effects smoothen the scene cuts for the eyes of the audience and refresh the mind to let them focus on the next scene.

Overlay Effect – Overlay effect is widely used in intro and outro of videos as well as to show titles and call to action options. Beautiful overlay effects can enhance the video content immensely and make it appear soothing to the eyes.

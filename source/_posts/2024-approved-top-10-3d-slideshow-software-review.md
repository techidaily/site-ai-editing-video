The 1980s is widely regarded as the golden era of music and film-making. If you play a video recorded in the 80s, you'll notice graininess, blurriness, and light exposure, giving the footage a dreamy vintage touch. So, in this short tutorial, we'll learn how to create a vintage 1980-style video with a retro effect that will leave your audience yearning for more.

## Preparation

![1980s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1980s-vintage-scene.gif)

In this tutorial, you'll need at least two video clips. First, take clear footage of a hoop dancer playing to music and a disco ball footage that you'll add to the background. You can also add another footage to give your dancing video the perfect transition.

**How to create a retro-style music video shot in the 80s:**

##### Step1 Import the video clips on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

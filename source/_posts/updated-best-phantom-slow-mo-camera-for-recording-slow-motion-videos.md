## How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects

Everyone has seen those transition or animation video cuts when something doesn't quite seem right; the movement appears forced or the playback is choppy. Typically, this occurs because a motion blur effect was not used while editing. Learning the ins, outs, rights, and wrongs of Motion Blur in After Effects is one of the most thrilling early steps in the motion graphics adventure. Learning how and when to utilize it successfully is a true "level up" moment for most designers.

Making everything you add to a motion graphic or animation project appear like it belongs there organically and hasn't been "artificially" inserted is a crucial component. Adding motion blur After Effects Is a fantastic tool for making items mix more naturally in your compositions. Let's quickly examine Motion Blur with all of this in mind. To help you better grasp motion blur and how to add motion blur to flawlessly merge objects in your video projects or even create styled effects, we've put up a detailed guide here.

1. [Import Files](#part3-1)
2. [Utilize Filmstock](#part3-2)
3. [Edit Effect](#part3-3)
4. [Apply filters](#part3-4)
5. [Export](#part3-5)

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 2\. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects

In videos, slow-motion may be used in a variety of ways, such as to convey the emotional context of a story or make beautiful slideshow backdrops. It doesn't matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects' slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.

Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You'll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:

**Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:**

So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur's magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.

Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn't already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation.

Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose "Effects & Presets." A search bar will appear as a result. Enter "CC Force Motion Blur" in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.

![preview effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

Step3 Next, drag the "CC Force Motion Blur" to the layers that represent your imported video at the bottom left of the screen. On the left side of the screen, under "CC Force Motion Blur," you will find settings for motion blur. Here, you may change the motion blur to suit your needs. You may type in the values and watch the video as appropriate. There are several choices available for you to modify.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Before applying any speed effects, first trim your film to the proper length. Once the speed effects have been included, you need also make sure that your composition is lengthy enough for your clip. Once you're satisfied with the footage you want to slow down, choose one of the ways—Time warp or Time Stretch.

Step4 Customize "Shutter Angle" and "Motion Blur Samples." Always be careful to preview the video after any modifications. Adjust to your needs and specifications. Additionally, if you wish, you may add any additional effect to the video. When finished, save the video by selecting "File" in the upper left corner.

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 2\. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects

In videos, slow-motion may be used in a variety of ways, such as to convey the emotional context of a story or make beautiful slideshow backdrops. It doesn't matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects' slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.

Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You'll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:

**Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:**

So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur's magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.

Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn't already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose "New Project" to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.

![install adobe after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-adobe-after-effects.jpg)

Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose "Effects & Presets." A search bar will appear as a result. Enter "CC Force Motion Blur" in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.

![preview effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

Step3 Next, drag the "CC Force Motion Blur" to the layers that represent your imported video at the bottom left of the screen. On the left side of the screen, under "CC Force Motion Blur," you will find settings for motion blur. Here, you may change the motion blur to suit your needs. You may type in the values and watch the video as appropriate. There are several choices available for you to modify.

![cc force motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/cc-force-motion-blur.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Before applying any speed effects, first trim your film to the proper length. Once the speed effects have been included, you need also make sure that your composition is lengthy enough for your clip. Once you're satisfied with the footage you want to slow down, choose one of the ways—Time warp or Time Stretch.

Step4 Customize "Shutter Angle" and "Motion Blur Samples." Always be careful to preview the video after any modifications. Adjust to your needs and specifications. Additionally, if you wish, you may add any additional effect to the video. When finished, save the video by selecting "File" in the upper left corner.

![composition settings after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/composition-settings-after-effects.jpg)

Step5 Finally, hit the OK button and afterwards, export the project with the Motion Blur embedded inside the main video. Adobe AE also gives you flexibility to export to the desired format with the preset project settings.

## Part 3\. Other Video Editor to Add Effects to Videos

Due to its cost and adaptability, Adobe After Effects is quite expensive; especially for the beginners. So, we’ve a handy option, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare, that is a fantastic option since most high-end video editors are, to put it mildly, expensive. It may seem natural to just add motion blur to everything before rendering while working on a conventional 2D project in After Effects, but there are occasions when having no motion blur at all is preferable. When used properly, After Effects' slow-motion features are extensive and reliable.

## How to Correct Lens Distortion With Filmora

The distortion in your video may irritate you when you're working on the video's edit. When you take images or record sound, you frequently end up with distorted results due to lens distortion. In this article, we will discuss what lens distortion is, how it may be fixed, and the factors you need to pay attention to avoid lens distortion when taking or recording videos.

## Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion

**1\. What is lens distortion**

Distortion means that the straight rectilinear projection is not straight. In the pinhole camera model, lens distortion is measured by how far from the image's ideal projection is. From a geometric optics point of view, the scene's straight lines don't look straight in the image.

When you take a picture, the camera lens can somehow change the shape of the image. It is called camera lens distortion. In simple terms, we can tell you that this is the case because distortion in-camera is when the lens makes curved lines in an image and doesn't show the straight lines from the scene.

**2\. What cause it**

Lens distortion happens with all lenses. It is because of several things, such as how the lens is curved, how far away the subject is, and the angle at which the photo was taken. Furthermore, it changes the image in many ways, but you can see it most when straight lines at the frame's edges are no longer parallel.

Most geometric lens distortions happen when the focal distance is short (barrel distortion), long (pincushion distortion), or when a fish-eye lens is used to take a picture from a low angle (keystone distortion).

## Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?

A lot of times, with lower-end wide-angle lenses, especially action cams like GoPro, you get pretty gnarly distortion when you're filming. As we know, the Earth is round, but it shouldn't look like this when you take a picture. Indeed, it's very distorted, it has the horizon line bending all over the place, and basically, all of the lines in the video have some level of curvature.

Hence, follow all the steps below to know how to fix it:

Step1 Import your video to [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![import your video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-1.jpg)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the "Camera model" based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7\. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.

![click on the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-2.jpg)

Step3 To adjust the distortion, you can slide the bar to the left or the right. If you slide the bar to the right (maximum level), there will be no adjustment. However, if you slide the bar to the left, you can see it pulling those lines as high up as possible.

You can see a bit of curvature, but it looks much more natural, and all of the lines in the video look so much better.

![adjust the distortion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-3.gif)

Step4 Lastly, if you play the video back, you will see the video look much better than before.

## Part 3: How to avoid distorted lens while shooting?

**1\. Avoid very wide-angle lenses**

The more distortion there is in a lens, like a 15mm prime, the wider it is. Sometimes you need a very wide-angle lens, and distortion is unavoidable. If you have room to move back, you could try using a lens with a different focal length.

**2\. Avoid getting too close**

Doing so will enhance optical distortion in many lenses and the likelihood of perspective distortion in all lenses.

**3\. Be mindful of your composition**

There are numerous instances where distortion is acceptable or even intended. Others must be carefully examined, such as utilizing a wide-angle lens to photograph a row of people. When you get too close to a group, the distortion makes the people at each end appear considerably wider! Therefore, consider your composition. Stand back and add space around your group; if necessary, you can trim the image afterward.

**4\. Use a 50mm lens**

50mm lenses are often called "all-purpose" lenses. There is a good reason

for this. A 50mm lens is great for portraits, street photography, and many other kinds of photography, including architecture. If your subject is big, you just need space to stand back. You will see that a 50mm lens rarely distorts the image.

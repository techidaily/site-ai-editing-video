Online-Convert is a popular online file format converter. It supports north of 50 video source formats and allows you to convert files between them. Also, Online-Convert allows you to change the video's frame rate. You can make it 60 FPS or even 120 FPS!

But please remember that, as the tool name suggests, Online-Convert is only a file converter. You can't edit your videos using this online service. Thus, you need to either have a reliable video editor on your device or use another online tool with an editor function.

Anyway, here is a tutorial on how to convert videos to 60 FPS with this online tool:

Step1 Launch a web browser and go to the Online-Convert tool page.

Step2 Drag the video file to the green rectangle. Alternatively, click "Choose File"/ Enter URL" / "Dropbox" / "Google Drive" to import your file.

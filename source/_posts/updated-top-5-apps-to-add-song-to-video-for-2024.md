Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

#### In this article

01 [Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT](#part1)

02 [How to Create Your Own LUT](#part2)

03 [How to Use Custom LUTs in Filmora](#part3)

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

![adjust setting to create lut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-your-own-lut.png)

Tweak these settings until you’re satisfied with the results. To help you make the adjustments and balance the intensity of the colors in your footage, check the color histogram located at the top right corner of the window.

###

### Step 5\. Save Your LUT

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

## Step by Step to Resize Video in Davinci Resolve

While editing videos, you may change the aspect ratio of the video to change the size of the video to upload on different platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram. Videos come in different sizes and shapes. Some videos are portraits while the others are landscapes. Similarly, videos are captured in different places with different devices. So, we need to set a certain size of the video.

Definitely, a very large video can make delays in the work, similarly, a small size video can result in low resolution and bad quality. Resizing a video saves a lot of time and money whether you have a business, a YouTube channel, a short film, or a feature film. Today, we shall discuss **how to resize the videos?**

The two **free ways to resize the video…**

Here are a number of tools used in the market to resize the videos. We are going to teach How to resize the video in **Davinci resolve** and **Fimora wondershare**. Once you have mastered How to resize a video, it would be as simple as the ‘click’.

Now the good news is, you can dramatically export the videos in the same resolution in a very short time.

**Let’s dive in** **!**

## **Part 1\. How to resize video in Davinci Resolve**

Davinci Resolve is a very powerful tool to edit videos. Let’s suppose, you have some videos shots and all the videos have different sizes, some of the videos fit in the timeline and some are out of the timeline. No matter, you are going to make a video on the same scale with the same size.

Resize the video can be done in three ways:

1. Zoom in zoom out
2. Cropping
3. Retime and scaling

### **1\. Zoom in and Zoom out**

First of all, select the videos in your timeline. You should stay in the middle of the frame to set it because it’s too wide. The timeline moves forward and backward. Let your video be 4k, go to the bottom-right corner and click on timeline format. Select timeline resolution, select ultra HD, or whatever you want from the drop-down list.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-1.png)

Go to the **inspector** from the up-right corner and select **Transform** under the **video** section. Here you can resize your image. Place the mouse over **zoom** **x** (Horizontal) and **zoom** **y** (vertical) values to drag left or right for zoom in or zoom out. The video can be resized accordingly.

Here you can also change its **rotation**.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-2.png)

### **2\. Cropping**

Go to the **inspector** from the up-right corner and select **Transform**. Now choose **Cropping.** Here are four options **Crop left, crop right, crop Bottom,** and **crop Top.** You can drag the scale from left to right to adjust the crop settings according to the desired result.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-3.png)

### **3\. Retime and scaling**

Go to the **inspector** from the up-right corner and select **retime and scaling**. You can choose stretch, Fit, Fill, or crop for cropping the video from the drop-down list.

* The **Crop** function is used to remove the unnecessary or uneven part of the video.
* The **Fit** function is to have the video auto-center and the selected clips are formatted according to the screen dimensions.
* **Stretch** Function allows changing the length of the certain clip at a certain duration.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-4.png)

After transforming, cropping, and resizing the videos, you can copy the same settings without repeating the above steps for each video.

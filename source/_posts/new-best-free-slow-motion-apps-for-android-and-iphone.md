## Part 2: How to Edit Time-Lapse Video on a Computer

There are a few things to keep in mind when creating a time-lapse video on a computer. First, make sure the video resolution is high enough to create a good image. Second, make sure the video is smooth and free from any choppy or jittery movements. Finally, make sure the video is timed correctly so that the scenes move in smooth, chronological order.

**Here's how you can make a time-lapse video on your computer:**

Step1 Install a program like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. These programs allow you to set up scenes and transitions in advance so that when you start filming, everything is ready to go.

Step2 Get started by choosing a period and location this will help you decide what kind of scenery will make sense for your scene. The longer the period, the more important it is to pick one that has a lot of natural light. If there are no natural light sources available, consider shooting on an overcast day or at night instead.

Step3 Next, choose what type of camera angle works best for showing off your subject matter; this could be static shots or moving ones that mimic motion through time or space. Also, consider how far away from your subject matter you want viewers to see them from before deciding on which angle works best for showing both sides equally well without making either side too large.

### Benefits of editing time-lapse on computer

Time-lapse videos are a great way to capture incredible footage of your life with minimal effort. You can set the speed of your camera, and then sit back and watch as it moves through time in real-time.

1) You can play with the speed of the camera to get just the right look. You might find that you want it to go faster or slower, or even stop altogether so that you can get a good shot of something specific in your life (like the chirping of birds or water droplets).

2) Editing time-lapses on your computer allows you to zoom in and out at will you don't have to worry about adjusting the zoom on your camera when you're filming something out of frame, which means less work for you!

3) Time-lapses are great for making movies that go from beginning to end you can make one movie that shows how you spend each day from sunrise until sunset or one where every hour is its scene. This way, people who watch your videos will see exactly what they need without having to listen over and over again about all things related to everyday life (which would be boring!).

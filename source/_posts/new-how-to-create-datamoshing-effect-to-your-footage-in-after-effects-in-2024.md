## How to Create Datamoshing Effect to Your Footage in After Effects?

Experimenting with new effects and filters has become part and parcel of life, especially for creative professionals. Datamoshing is a similar effect that displays errors and flaws in the video clips to leave an impression on the audience. In most terms, the datamoshing effect shares similarities with the glitch effect.

Henceforth, the write-up shall focus on the introduction of this effect along with its workability. The procedure to create datamosh After Effects would also be covered. So, let us begin!

#### In this article

01 [What is the Datamoshing Effect?](#part1)

02 [How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?](#part2)

03 [Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)](#part3)

04 [How to Do Datamoshing Effect with Datamosh Plugin in After Effects](#part4)

## Part 1: What is the Datamoshing Effect?

Before going into the depths of workability and operation of the datamoshing effect in After Effects, let us understand the effect in detail. The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.

In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.

Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.

## Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?

The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.

Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.

The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.

The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.

The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.

## Part 3: Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)

Understanding the datamosh After Effects is one thing, and incorporating it in your footage is another. The section shall walk you through the step-by-step guide to create the After Effects' datamoshing effect without a plugin. So, let's go, shall we?

### Step 1: Preliminary Process

The first step is easy. Open After Effects from your system. Import the targeted video that needs the datamosh effect. After that, head to the "Content-Aware Fill" to begin the process.

![tap on content aware fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Creating the Reference Frame

Use the playhead where you wish to create the effect, and then click on "Create Reference Frame." The picture frame opens in Photoshop, and the user is expected to save it. Now, go back to the After Effects.

![create reference frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Smearing Process

Now, hide the top layer so that the smearing can occur. Turn the Masks to "None" so that you can perform the masking. Split the second layer to duplicate the layer as we make changes to it. Set the "Masks" to "Subtract and then add a refine soft matte.

![ smearing process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-3.jpg)

### Step 4: Pre-composing the Clip

It is important to pre-compose the clip, so right-click on the timeline and hit "Pre-compose" to the menu list that appears. Tick mark "Move all attributes into the new composition" and rename the clip afterward. Hit "OK."

![pre-compose clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Rendering Queue

Double-click on the timeline, hold shift and drag it until the clip snaps. Press "B" on your keyboard and "N" on the other side to snap the work area. Navigate to "File" and "Export" and then click on "Render Queue."

![render queue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-5.jpg)

### Step 6: Generating Fill Layer

Import the file when it is done rendering and drag it to the timeline. Trim the work area again using B and N buttons from the keyboard. Ensure that the fill method is "Surface," and the range is "Work Area." Click on "Generate Fill Layer" to start the analyzing process.

![generate fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-6.jpg)

### Step 7: Creating the Transition

The user is expected to create a transition between the two shots. Use the track matte to make solid and fractal noise. In the "Noise and Grain" section, click on "Fractal noise" and then switch the fractal type to "Basic." Now, keyframe the "Brightness" and simultaneously turn its level to black and white to create a transition.

![create transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Achieving a Glitchy Effect

To give the glitchy effect, head to the "Effects and Presets" and hit "Posterize," and reduce its level to a couple of integers. Pull the transition down to the fill layer and set it to "Luma Matte." It will showcase the halo sign that we masked around the image.

![create glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Have a Finer Imprint

To eliminate it, use the "Set Matte" channel and alter its layer to the one we pre-composed. Now, invert the matte. Moving on, navigate to the "Simple Choker" and reduce it to one pixel. For perfection, duplicate it and get a finer imprint.

![customize simple choker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-9.jpg)

### Step 10: Final Process

Duplicate the grey solid and then extend the second clip to our fill. In the last step, change the layer of the second clip to "Luma Matte" and save the video. You are done with the process.

![change to luma matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-10.jpg)

## Part 1: What is the Datamoshing Effect?

Before going into the depths of workability and operation of the datamoshing effect in After Effects, let us understand the effect in detail. The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.

In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.

Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.

## Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?

The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.

Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.

The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.

The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.

The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.

## Part 3: Step by Step to Create Datamoshing Effect in After Effects (Without Plugin)

Understanding the datamosh After Effects is one thing, and incorporating it in your footage is another. The section shall walk you through the step-by-step guide to create the After Effects' datamoshing effect without a plugin. So, let's go, shall we?

### Step 1: Preliminary Process

The first step is easy. Open After Effects from your system. Import the targeted video that needs the datamosh effect. After that, head to the "Content-Aware Fill" to begin the process.

![tap on content aware fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Creating the Reference Frame

Use the playhead where you wish to create the effect, and then click on "Create Reference Frame." The picture frame opens in Photoshop, and the user is expected to save it. Now, go back to the After Effects.

![create reference frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-2.jpg)

### Step 3: Smearing Process

Now, hide the top layer so that the smearing can occur. Turn the Masks to "None" so that you can perform the masking. Split the second layer to duplicate the layer as we make changes to it. Set the "Masks" to "Subtract and then add a refine soft matte.

![ smearing process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-3.jpg)

### Step 4: Pre-composing the Clip

It is important to pre-compose the clip, so right-click on the timeline and hit "Pre-compose" to the menu list that appears. Tick mark "Move all attributes into the new composition" and rename the clip afterward. Hit "OK."

![pre-compose clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-4.jpg)

### Step 5: Rendering Queue

Double-click on the timeline, hold shift and drag it until the clip snaps. Press "B" on your keyboard and "N" on the other side to snap the work area. Navigate to "File" and "Export" and then click on "Render Queue."

![render queue](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-5.jpg)

### Step 6: Generating Fill Layer

Import the file when it is done rendering and drag it to the timeline. Trim the work area again using B and N buttons from the keyboard. Ensure that the fill method is "Surface," and the range is "Work Area." Click on "Generate Fill Layer" to start the analyzing process.

![generate fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-6.jpg)

### Step 7: Creating the Transition

The user is expected to create a transition between the two shots. Use the track matte to make solid and fractal noise. In the "Noise and Grain" section, click on "Fractal noise" and then switch the fractal type to "Basic." Now, keyframe the "Brightness" and simultaneously turn its level to black and white to create a transition.

![create transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Achieving a Glitchy Effect

To give the glitchy effect, head to the "Effects and Presets" and hit "Posterize," and reduce its level to a couple of integers. Pull the transition down to the fill layer and set it to "Luma Matte." It will showcase the halo sign that we masked around the image.

![create glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Have a Finer Imprint

To eliminate it, use the "Set Matte" channel and alter its layer to the one we pre-composed. Now, invert the matte. Moving on, navigate to the "Simple Choker" and reduce it to one pixel. For perfection, duplicate it and get a finer imprint.

![customize simple choker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-9.jpg)

### Step 10: Final Process

Duplicate the grey solid and then extend the second clip to our fill. In the last step, change the layer of the second clip to "Luma Matte" and save the video. You are done with the process.

![change to luma matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-10.jpg)

## How to Remove Audio From Videos with FFmpeg?

Unbelievably, the globe has been making headway in its endeavors. Considering how far the world has come in producing amazing things in recent times, it is impossible to fathom the progress made in the digital industry. There are now millions of video editing programs like **FFmpeg that remove audio**, each allowing you to accomplish anything. In addition to video editing, it is now possible to modify the music playing in the backdrop of a video. Doesn't it seem impossible to you? However, it has an actual appearance and is simple to pull audio from a video. You will, however, need to choose a tool with great care and consideration.

In the following parts, we will discuss how to **remove audio from video with FFmpeg** successfully. In addition, we have also looked at other software that has the potential to be an alternative to FFmpeg that is far more effective.

![remove audio from video ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Use FFmpeg to Remove Audio from Videos?

FFMPEG is a highly flexible video editing program from the command line. You may use it for various purposes, including converting between different file formats. But in addition to that, you may use it to **remove audio from your videos** or clips. Here are two different ways to delete audio using FFMPEG, depending on what you want to do. But most crucially, speed and quality are not sacrificed with any of these choices. It's about coding. When using other people's code, also label the author. Using FFmpeg, you can separate the audio. The audio in video files may be removed, added, extracted, and added again with the help of this powerful utility.

You will only need to [**install FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) on your computer after you have purchased it. Removing video is straightforward, so you won't have to put in much effort to achieve this goal. Let's look at the many methods available.

**Use the Command Line**

Step1 The command to extract audio from your video file is visible for your review.

![ffmpeg use the command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-2.jpg)

Step2 It would be helpful if you updated the extension and the name of the file that was entered, but other than that, you won't need to do anything else.

![ffmpeg audio command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-3.jpg)

The preceding command is successful if the input file certifies. This is why you need to find the codec for the audio stream. If you obey this order, you will accomplish what you set out to do. A user might sometimes use an audio format returned by the previous command. However, this will only occasionally be successful.

The storage format that FFmpeg employs is determined by looking at the output file's extension. It would help if you knew that a storage format, a container, and an audio format are distinct. You will encounter a scenario where the audio format does not have a container named after it. Two problematic formats are among the most common formats; they are PCM and Vorbis. OGG is compatible with Vorbis, whereas WAV is compatible with PCM.

Let's investigate another approach to extract audio from a video using FFmpeg if the prior one was too difficult for you to grasp.

**Use the Terminal**

Step1 Verify that the format remains the same.

You will need to locate the video in its original format to be able to extract the audio from it. If you are unfamiliar with the primary format, you will be unable to determine the appropriate file extension. Because of this, you are going to need to make use of the ffprobe command.

![ffmpeg check the original format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-4.jpg)

Now, change "myvideo.mp4" to the name of the video file you want to use. This will verify that you are familiar with the video's original file format.

After learning about the original audio's format, you can reencode a video clip to remove the audio from it.

![ffmpeg reencoding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-5.jpg)

Step2 Modify the format, please.

You might try replacing myvideo.mp4 with the directory and filename to see if it helps. Additionally, it would be helpful if you updated the name of the audio.ogg file with the name you want to use.

Therefore, if you follow the two approaches discussed above, you can extract audio from your video files with little to no work. To completely comprehend the stages, you must examine them in great detail.

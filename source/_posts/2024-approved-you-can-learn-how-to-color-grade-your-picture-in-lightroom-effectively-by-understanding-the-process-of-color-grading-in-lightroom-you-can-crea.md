## What Is Color Grading?

Color grading is one of the essential processes for creating the perfect video and image content. Like with color correction, color grading helps enhance the appearance of your image or video and makes it appealing to viewers. However, unlike color correction, it focuses on creating stylistic or cinematic effects rather than rectifying mistakes in the image.

Color grading enhances an already edited or otherwise perfect image or video. So, in color grading, you are not trying to balance out colors or make your pictures look natural to the human eyes. Color correction does all that. Instead, with color grading, you aim to "paint over" a color-corrected content to evoke specific emotions or moods in the viewers.

Colors carry different emotions or visual tones. So, they're essential in the post-production process to manipulate viewers into specific moods that tell your story best. In other words, color grading aligns your viewer's emotions to the central theme in your story.

![color grading in lightroom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-lightroom-1.jpg)

For example, if your image or video's theme is passion, power, violence, or danger, red portrays them perfectly. Meanwhile, blue does it when you wish to evoke calmness and melancholy in your viewers.

Other examples include:

* pink for beauty, innocence, and femininity,
* Green for nature, darkness, and corruption
* Purple for fantasies, and the mystical
* Yellow for obsession, sickness, and naivety
* Orange for warmth, friendliness, youth, and happiness

Have you noticed that turning your pictures black and white makes them look timeless? That's color grading in action.

## Color Grading in LightRoom

Are you amazed by the thrilling power of color grading to manipulate viewers' emotions? Are you wondering how you can achieve that effect seamlessly? Then, you don't need to worry about it. With Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, you too can make magic.

Since Lightroom is an advanced photo editor, it has a lot to offer in features. Unfortunately, this may also mean that it can be complex to understand, especially if you're new to photo editing. So, first things first, you must understand the color grading panel in Lightroom to appreciate it better.

Lightroom's color grading panel is right beneath the HSL panel in the Develop Panel. It serves as a replacement for the Split Toning Panel from earlier versions, so it's pretty easy to find.

The color grading panel comprises five small icons, three color wheels, and a blending/balance slider:

### ● The Five Small Icons

Lightroom's small icons are a 3-way default layout, shadows, mid-tones, highlights, and global. With 3-way, you can manipulate the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones. Mid-tones, highlights, and shadows hide all color wheels, excluding the necessary ones that adjust them.

Meanwhile, Global combines and blends the highlights, mid-tones, and shadow adjustments no matter the luminosity. Global ensures that the color wheels work harmoniously.

When adjusting icons, it's best to use each color wheel one after another one. You'll get better and more precise outcomes that way compared to using them together.

### ● Lightroom's Color Wheels

You can view Lightroom's three-color wheels through the 3-way default layout. The color wheels help to enhance distinct image parts by providing various color hues. It also allows you to introduce saturation through an adjustable knob.

Each lightroom's color wheels feature a luminance slide beneath them that adjusts color brightness. Between the luminance slide and the wheel is a visible eye icon that you can use to turn the effects on or off.

### ● The Blending and Balance Slider

The blending and balance sliders offer you advanced control over how your colors look after introducing them. With the blending slider, you can control the color distinctiveness between highlights and shadows. In other words, this feature helps to merge colors to produce a much more balanced and beautiful result.

The balance slider adjusts altered mid-tones, highlights, and shadows to balance the effects. By default, the slider is set at 0 in the middle and allows you to move it in opposite directions for distinct effects. For example, you can use this tool to balance shadows with over-concentrated colors.

While the above features are visible to everyone in the 3-way view, there are two more hidden sliders. You may only view them when editing highlights, shadows, mid-tones, or the global color wheels. They're the hue and saturation sliders that you can only uncover by clicking on the arrow below the eye icon.

There's no idea why the hue and saturation sliders aren't visible in the 3-way view. That's especially when you discover that they do the all-important job of making minor but precise changes to final adjustments. This produces an excellent fine-tuned outcome and gives your image a professional finish.

## How To Color Grade Your Picture in LightRoom

If you wish to use the color grading Lightroom tool to enhance photos, here's a comprehensive guide for you. You'll learn the best practices to apply when using the specific Lightroom features to produce your desired effects:

#### ● Pick Your Color Scheme

What's color grading without the right colors? Choosing an appropriate color scheme is one of the essential steps in Lightroom color grading. That's because it sets the tone for the next steps. If you choose the wrong colors, you won't get the excellent result you desire no matter how hard you try.

First, take a good look at your picture and its visible colors. Then think of the colors that compliment or contrast with them. For example, you should base images with red highlights around red. You can also try colors close to red in the color wheel, like orange.

Once you've found the colors that suit your image, you're ready for the next steps in your color grading process. However, more than just adding colors, you must also pay attention to contrasting colors during processing. If you find such unwanted colors, use the HSL panel to pale them out.

#### ● Prioritize Precision

In earlier paragraphs, you learned that working with the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones individually is best. That's because individual adjustments are a painstaking process that guarantees the most accurate results. This makes a lot of difference in the final product compared to when you work with the wheel.

Working on the shadows, highlights, and mid-tones individually also connects to the hue and saturation sliders. So you remember how vital these hidden sliders are? You wouldn't be able to access them by working on the tools one after another. Take that as your reward for being detail-oriented.

#### ● Increase Saturation Values

Sometimes, the effect of one tool tells on another. For example, leaving your saturation values below may render your hue slider ineffective. To avoid that confusion, it's best to increase your saturation levels to some values higher than your preferred one.

Yes, it wouldn't look nice initially as you adjust the hue. However, it will ensure that you get the perfect color for your image. You can always go back to adjust the saturation to your choice values later on.

#### ● Use Color Wheels To Find Color, Use Shadows to Refine

When discussing how to choose your color scheme, you must have understood how vital the color wheel is in finding harmonious hues. However, picking your preferred color isn't the complete process. You must learn to fine-tune your chosen color by using the hue slider. Do this after adjusting the saturation to your preferred level as in the previous step. The result is always mind-blowing.

![how to use color grading in lightroom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-lightroom-3.jpg)

#### ● Learn the Short Cuts

There are some shortcuts to learn when color grading in Lightroom to enhance accuracy and convenience. For example, option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) gives you better control over your image's outcomes. Option/Alt + Up will increase saturation by one while the shift key adjusts it. You can use Command (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows) to adjust the hue. Also, the reset button on the right side of your panel takes you back to your initial image.

#### ● Extra Tips

These best practices will help you to achieve excellent results:

1. Don't color grade without understanding the psychology of colors. Know what colors convey different moods or emotions.
2. Be sure to work with high-quality pictures. Color grading isn't magic; it wouldn't correct an already lousy image.
3. Shooting your pictures in RAW gives you more color control.

## Conclusion

● Now that you've learned how to color grade using Lightroom, there's no limit to what you can achieve. You can now explore your creative side with so much fun. However, know that you will likely not get it right the first time. Perfection comes with consistent practice or trial and error.

Colors carry different emotions or visual tones. So, they're essential in the post-production process to manipulate viewers into specific moods that tell your story best. In other words, color grading aligns your viewer's emotions to the central theme in your story.

![color grading in lightroom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-lightroom-1.jpg)

For example, if your image or video's theme is passion, power, violence, or danger, red portrays them perfectly. Meanwhile, blue does it when you wish to evoke calmness and melancholy in your viewers.

Other examples include:

* pink for beauty, innocence, and femininity,
* Green for nature, darkness, and corruption
* Purple for fantasies, and the mystical
* Yellow for obsession, sickness, and naivety
* Orange for warmth, friendliness, youth, and happiness

Have you noticed that turning your pictures black and white makes them look timeless? That's color grading in action.

## Color Grading in LightRoom

Are you amazed by the thrilling power of color grading to manipulate viewers' emotions? Are you wondering how you can achieve that effect seamlessly? Then, you don't need to worry about it. With Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, you too can make magic.

Since Lightroom is an advanced photo editor, it has a lot to offer in features. Unfortunately, this may also mean that it can be complex to understand, especially if you're new to photo editing. So, first things first, you must understand the color grading panel in Lightroom to appreciate it better.

Lightroom's color grading panel is right beneath the HSL panel in the Develop Panel. It serves as a replacement for the Split Toning Panel from earlier versions, so it's pretty easy to find.

The color grading panel comprises five small icons, three color wheels, and a blending/balance slider:

### ● The Five Small Icons

Lightroom's small icons are a 3-way default layout, shadows, mid-tones, highlights, and global. With 3-way, you can manipulate the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones. Mid-tones, highlights, and shadows hide all color wheels, excluding the necessary ones that adjust them.

Meanwhile, Global combines and blends the highlights, mid-tones, and shadow adjustments no matter the luminosity. Global ensures that the color wheels work harmoniously.

When adjusting icons, it's best to use each color wheel one after another one. You'll get better and more precise outcomes that way compared to using them together.

### ● Lightroom's Color Wheels

You can view Lightroom's three-color wheels through the 3-way default layout. The color wheels help to enhance distinct image parts by providing various color hues. It also allows you to introduce saturation through an adjustable knob.

Each lightroom's color wheels feature a luminance slide beneath them that adjusts color brightness. Between the luminance slide and the wheel is a visible eye icon that you can use to turn the effects on or off.

### ● The Blending and Balance Slider

The blending and balance sliders offer you advanced control over how your colors look after introducing them. With the blending slider, you can control the color distinctiveness between highlights and shadows. In other words, this feature helps to merge colors to produce a much more balanced and beautiful result.

The balance slider adjusts altered mid-tones, highlights, and shadows to balance the effects. By default, the slider is set at 0 in the middle and allows you to move it in opposite directions for distinct effects. For example, you can use this tool to balance shadows with over-concentrated colors.

While the above features are visible to everyone in the 3-way view, there are two more hidden sliders. You may only view them when editing highlights, shadows, mid-tones, or the global color wheels. They're the hue and saturation sliders that you can only uncover by clicking on the arrow below the eye icon.

There's no idea why the hue and saturation sliders aren't visible in the 3-way view. That's especially when you discover that they do the all-important job of making minor but precise changes to final adjustments. This produces an excellent fine-tuned outcome and gives your image a professional finish.

## How To Color Grade Your Picture in LightRoom

If you wish to use the color grading Lightroom tool to enhance photos, here's a comprehensive guide for you. You'll learn the best practices to apply when using the specific Lightroom features to produce your desired effects:

#### ● Pick Your Color Scheme

What's color grading without the right colors? Choosing an appropriate color scheme is one of the essential steps in Lightroom color grading. That's because it sets the tone for the next steps. If you choose the wrong colors, you won't get the excellent result you desire no matter how hard you try.

First, take a good look at your picture and its visible colors. Then think of the colors that compliment or contrast with them. For example, you should base images with red highlights around red. You can also try colors close to red in the color wheel, like orange.

Once you've found the colors that suit your image, you're ready for the next steps in your color grading process. However, more than just adding colors, you must also pay attention to contrasting colors during processing. If you find such unwanted colors, use the HSL panel to pale them out.

#### ● Prioritize Precision

In earlier paragraphs, you learned that working with the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones individually is best. That's because individual adjustments are a painstaking process that guarantees the most accurate results. This makes a lot of difference in the final product compared to when you work with the wheel.

Working on the shadows, highlights, and mid-tones individually also connects to the hue and saturation sliders. So you remember how vital these hidden sliders are? You wouldn't be able to access them by working on the tools one after another. Take that as your reward for being detail-oriented.

#### ● Increase Saturation Values

Sometimes, the effect of one tool tells on another. For example, leaving your saturation values below may render your hue slider ineffective. To avoid that confusion, it's best to increase your saturation levels to some values higher than your preferred one.

Yes, it wouldn't look nice initially as you adjust the hue. However, it will ensure that you get the perfect color for your image. You can always go back to adjust the saturation to your choice values later on.

#### ● Use Color Wheels To Find Color, Use Shadows to Refine

When discussing how to choose your color scheme, you must have understood how vital the color wheel is in finding harmonious hues. However, picking your preferred color isn't the complete process. You must learn to fine-tune your chosen color by using the hue slider. Do this after adjusting the saturation to your preferred level as in the previous step. The result is always mind-blowing.

![how to use color grading in lightroom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-lightroom-3.jpg)

#### ● Learn the Short Cuts

There are some shortcuts to learn when color grading in Lightroom to enhance accuracy and convenience. For example, option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) gives you better control over your image's outcomes. Option/Alt + Up will increase saturation by one while the shift key adjusts it. You can use Command (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows) to adjust the hue. Also, the reset button on the right side of your panel takes you back to your initial image.

#### ● Extra Tips

These best practices will help you to achieve excellent results:

1. Don't color grade without understanding the psychology of colors. Know what colors convey different moods or emotions.
2. Be sure to work with high-quality pictures. Color grading isn't magic; it wouldn't correct an already lousy image.
3. Shooting your pictures in RAW gives you more color control.

## Conclusion

● Now that you've learned how to color grade using Lightroom, there's no limit to what you can achieve. You can now explore your creative side with so much fun. However, know that you will likely not get it right the first time. Perfection comes with consistent practice or trial and error.

## How to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

With the vast number of devices available in the market today, storing data and video files has become difficult. Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.

In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you'll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video's resolution, let's look into what a video resolution is!

## Part 1\. What Is a Video Resolution?

A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of **tiny pixels** and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.

Video resolution is rendered in a **vertical** and **horizontal** orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., **480p**, **720p**, **1080p,** etc.

In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a **720p** video is **1280 x 720,** and a **1080p** video is a **1920 x 1080** resolution.

![a video resolution dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-1.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.

![difference between a 4k and 8k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-6.png)

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

Now let's move to understanding the steps involved in changing the resolution of a video!

## Part 4\. Steps to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

## Part 1: What is HDR photography?

First things first. Before using the HDR feature on your smartphone, let’s learn what actually is the function of HDR.

Standing for High Dynamic Range, HDR is an image capturing method where the dynamic range of an image is high. When we talk about dynamic range, it refers to the difference between the lightest and the darkest elements of a picture. Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.

While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.

Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.

* For the Nexus 4 device that runs on Android 4.2 OS, the option of HDR mode can be turned on by simply long-tapping the viewfinder and then tapping on the HDR icon.
* You may also find the option of HDR mode under the labels like Backlight HDR or Backlight Correction HDR. On the Samsung Galaxy devices, HDR is labeled as Rich Tone and can be located under the Smart Modes menu.

## Part 4\. How To Make A Slow-Motion Video On Desktop Alternative?

Desktop video editing apps are better than mobile apps when editing slow-mo or ramping features. For one, the processing power of desktop computers is generally much higher than mobile devices. This means that desktop apps can handle more complex tasks without running into performance issues.

Another advantage of desktop video editing apps is that they usually come with a more robust set of features than their mobile counterparts. This is because app developers typically have more room to add features on desktop than they do on mobile.

Below are some simple and easy steps on how to use the speed ramping tool in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/):

Step1To begin, open **Filmora** on your PC and import the video you want to edit.

Step2Drag it into the timeline once the video is imported.

Step3Next, select the **"Speed"** option from the **Tools** option in the toolbar and click **"Speed Ramping."**

![using filmora software on the desktop for ramping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/using-filmora-software-on-the-desktop-for-ramping.jpg)

Step4Select the point in the video where you want the speed ramp to begin. Now, use the **slider** to adjust the speed of your video. You can make your video faster or slower.

![adjusting video speed on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/adjusting-video-speed-on-filmora.jpg)

What Are The Stages Of Film Production

## 1\. Pre-Production

The pre-production phase comes early in the process, it usually comes after the development and before the production itself. This stage includes finalizing the scripts, bringing together the actors and crew, browse for locations, deciding which equipment is needed, and deciding on the budget. Pre-production is a planning stage of the movie, where you confirm all the details of the project before starting on production.

Pre-production

## 2\. Production

Now the fun part begins. It is time to get the movie on camera. All the producers and directors finished making the plans from the use of all the production assets that are needed to make the movie. Once the cast and locations are set, the actual filming process can begin and this can take from days, weeks, to months depending on how many locations are used, how much scenes are being filmed and if there are any problems that occur that delays the filming process.

## 3\. Post-Production

![Post-Production](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/what-are-the-stages-of-film-production-04.jpg)

Post-Production

After the filming process, any re-taking, and other filming phases the entire crew has to go through, it is time for post-production. This stage is when the audio and visual materials are combined together to create the movie. An editor, or multiple editors are using the following procedures to create the film:

### A. Cutting and Trimming Shots

Tips

###### ▷ What's a Cut

In the film and video industry, a cut is described by when one clip ends and another one starts. For example, say you have a wide shot clip of a car driving as well as clip of a man’s eyes watching.

###### ▷ When Would the Cut Happen

The cut would happen when the first shot has ended and is followed by the second shot. Repeating that will have an impact on how the viewer sees the movie and follows the story.

### B. Adding Music and Sound Effect

Tips

###### ▷ Sound Effects

Depending on what kind of movie it is, sound effects can make a huge difference in the viewing experience. No matter if it’s an explosion, an extra wind sound, a door crackle, or laughing people in the background.

###### ▷ Deliver the Emotion

Many sound effects are placed into the film to deliver the emotion and get the viewer onto the edge of their seat as it amplifies the moment.

### C. Adding Visual Effects

Tips

###### ▷ The Benefit of Post-production

When there are visual effects showing in the movie, these are not made physically on set. The benefit of post-production is that there are unlimited choices of adding visual effects to strengthen a moment and the impact on the viewer.

###### ▷ Visual Effects

A lot of results are accomplished by visual effects because they would be impossible to re-create on set.

## 4\. Distribution

Distribution is the final stage of production, which happens after the film has been edited, and is ready for release. Many film makers and production companies will advertise the movie’s trailer on social media and the general internet to target the audience that loves the type of movie that has been made. They will either see it on social media or on television to drive people to theaters to watch the movie and get them into the story. A lot of movies have follow-ups when it’s been received really well creating a storyline.

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a **freeze-frame** as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.

They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a **freeze-frame** before uttering the lines, "As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster."

This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.

People, especially video editors prefer using Final Cut Pro for multiple reasons. Final Cut Pro features the most advanced organizing tools out of all the professional video editing software. Create Smart Collections that automatically compile content based on a set of specified criteria and tag entire clips or clip ranges with metadata for searching.

Considering its importance, this guide is to introduce different ways to split and merge video and answer the question that has been raised in your mind about whether there is any other software program that can be used as a Final Cut Pro alternative.

## Part 1\. How to split a clip in Final Cut Pro?

One of the most fundamental video editing skills you'll need to master is how to split clips in Final Cut Pro. After being divided in two, you can modify or reorganize one half of your clip without affecting the other.

### Way 1: Split a Clip in the Timeline (shortcut: Command+B)

**You can follow these steps to split a clip in the timeline:**

Step1The blade can be selected in Final Cut Pro by clicking the Tools pop-up menu in the timeline's upper left corner (or press B).

![clicking the tools pop up menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-1.jpg)

Step2Then click and move the skimmer to the frame in the video you wish to cut from.

Step3You can split the video by following these two methods:

* Choose Trim > Join Clips after selecting one or both sides of the edit point (or press Delete).
* Choose Trim > Join Clips after selecting the clips on either side of the edit.

### Way 2\. Split several clips at the same time

**You can follow these steps to split several clips at the same time:**

Step1Move the skimmer to the desired cutting frame in the Final Cut Pro timeline.

![final cut pro timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-4.jpg)

Step2Deciding on Trim > Blade All (or press **Shift+Command+B**). At the skimmer position, all clips are removed.

### Way 3\. Split all clips at once

The Blade command allows you to simultaneously cut selected core storyline segments and related clips.

![cut the chosen clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-6.jpg)

**Tips: How to heal the sliced clips?**

**How should I recover if there is an error in the edited video? Here are 3 methods for you.**

### Way 1: Delete the cut point (by pressing Delete)

You can follow these steps to merge 2 clips by clicking delete:

Step1Move the mouse over the time point you want to remove, then select Delete directly to restore the original full video.

![delete the cut point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

### Way 2: Undo the action (by pressing Command + Z)

You can either click **"Command + Z"** to reverse the process if you want to link the clips back together to repair a clip in the timeline.

### Way 3: merge 2 clips (by clicking &quot; Join Clips&quot;)

Choose two neighboring portions, then select **"Join Clips"** from the drop-down option under "Trim" to join the individual clips together into one.

![merge 2 clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/how-to-split-video-in-final-cut-pro-8.jpg)

**Tips:** These 3 ways only work if the two clips come from the same clip.

## Part 2\. How to split a clip in alternative to Final Cut Pro?

Final Cut Pro is a more complex user to understand; It can sometimes corrupt your file if it isn't saved properly, leading to all your work becoming lost. To save your work, you should do this every 5 minutes to ensure that your work doesn't corrupt. There are limited export settings; you are limited in the formats and sizes you can export from FCPX; whereas before, you could export many codecs and formats out of FCP, you must complete more specific encoding in a compressor.

Therefore, the alternative to Final Cut Pro is Filmora because it allows you to edit, split or merge clips in one go.

### Split a clip in the best alternative to FCP - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.

Unfortunately, you won’t be able to **make a gif in after effects** directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.

Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.

In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create **after effects GIFs** within a matter of minutes.

02 [What Is the Difference Between After Effects Gifs’ Making and Photoshop Gifs’ Making?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create After Effects Gifs](#Part 3)

## Part 1 General Knowledge on GIF Animation

### 01What is a GIF?

The acronym GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and the file is created in bitmap image format. This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.

This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.

However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.

Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.

You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.

### 02Why create a GIF?

Here are a handful of things you can keep your eye on if you are just starting on making GIFs;

**●** Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.

**●** You can provide instructions in a short span of time.

**●** UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.

**●** You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.

**●** You can display some amazing things on your website.

## Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop

Creating GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop are both one in the same thing but the results may vary depending on which choice of tools and features suits you better.

Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.

### 01What’s Similar?

Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.

### 02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition

In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.

Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.

Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.

### 03Vector and Shapes

You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.

### 04Destructive Effects

After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.

You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.

## Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs

After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.

Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.

### 01Animating in After Effects

**Step 1:** Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.

![new composition after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.

![project panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.

![timeline panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg)

Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.

![set scale after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg)

You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.

![set scale after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-5.jpg)

Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.

![repeat process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-6.jpg)

Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.

![set position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-7.jpg)

Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.

**Step 4:** Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.

![render after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-8.jpg)

If you find **exporting gifs from After Effects** too complicated, you can also upload and loop videos using **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** which has plenty of other amazing video editing features you can drag and drop to create.

### 02Converting Animation to GIF in Photoshop

**Step 1:** Create a new file in Photoshop with the same specs as you did in After Effects. Now go to ‘File’ > ‘Import’ > ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.

![import file photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-9.jpg)

**Step 2:** If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows > Timeline.

![timeline photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ > Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.

![export and save as gif photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-11.jpg)

**Step 4:** In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.

## Part 1 Ending Thoughts

**●** GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe **after effects gifs** or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.

**●** You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.

**●** After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after **exporting after effects to gif**. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.

### 02Converting Animation to GIF in Photoshop

**Step 1:** Create a new file in Photoshop with the same specs as you did in After Effects. Now go to ‘File’ > ‘Import’ > ‘Frames to Layers’ and import the saved .mov file.

![import file photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-9.jpg)

**Step 2:** If you don’t automatically see the timeline, go to Windows > Timeline.

![timeline photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-10.jpg)

**Step 3:** Decide on how many loops you want in your animation. Once you are done with your GIF, go to ‘File’ > Export. Apply the Legacy Save for Web and choose the format for your GIF.

![export and save as gif photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-11.jpg)

**Step 4:** In Export options, you can gain access to several presets to apply to your animated GIFs. The more color displayed in your GIF, the larger its size. You can use Dethering to smoothen gradients and shades. Looping is also turned off on Photoshop but you can apply looping from the ‘Options’ shown at the bottom of the menu.

## Part 1 Ending Thoughts

**●** GIFs are a popular type of media that is quite trendy and easy to make using Adobe **after effects gifs** or Photoshop. They are called Graphics Interchange Format and are best used as simple graphic images.

**●** You require a combination of both Photoshop and After Effects, though both share similar interfaces, tools, and effects. You can group or nest compositions, apply filters or effects, and adjust vectors and shapes.

**●** After Effects is better than Photoshop in terms of creating videos, so you can first create a project in AE and then import the project onto PS after **exporting after effects to gif**. You can also use Filmora for the first step of this process.

GIFs have been around for quite some time but as the flow of content continues to plummet on popular social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram, the demand for GIFs would continue to increase.

Unfortunately, you won’t be able to **make a gif in after effects** directly, unless with the help of a plug-in like GIFGun.

Before moving forward, keep in mind that using Adobe Media Encoder is an easier method for compressing your exports rather than any third-party compressor.

In this article, you will find easy to follow methods using which you can create **after effects GIFs** within a matter of minutes.

## Part 1 General Knowledge on GIF Animation

### 01What is a GIF?

The acronym GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and the file is created in bitmap image format. This was developed back in 1987 by a working in CompuServe.

This format was incredibly successful on the WEB due to benefits like smaller file sizes, broader support, and its easy compatibility with Operating Systems.

However, GIFs are much more suitable as simple graphics and logos rather than Live Action Videos with its palette limitation of 256 per image.

Creating a GIF is like looping an animation or animated elements. You can use these animated GIFs in banners to engage your audience or even create fun sharable content for your Facebook pages.

You can start by creating basic easy animations in Photoshop and then elevate them by using After Effects.

### 02Why create a GIF?

Here are a handful of things you can keep your eye on if you are just starting on making GIFs;

**●** Simple Product Demonstrations. With simple 3 to 4 step GIFs, you can briefly introduce steps on how to use a product.

**●** You can provide instructions in a short span of time.

**●** UX designers use GIFs to show the functioning of certain digital experiences.

**●** You can introduce GIFs on your page to keep followers engaged.

**●** You can display some amazing things on your website.

## Part 2 Difference between making GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop

Creating GIFs in After Effects and Photoshop are both one in the same thing but the results may vary depending on which choice of tools and features suits you better.

Now, for those who are learning Photoshop and After Effects for the first time, to understand the difference in results between both these software lets familiarize you with their features in brief.

### 01What’s Similar?

Since both are designed by Adobe, there are bound to be similarities in the tools and interface they use. Both these software enables you to use layers of editing from the layer panel where you separate the blending or transform multiple layers. You can apply masks to these layers in different ways on both software.

### 02Groups (PS) and Nested (AE) Composition

In Photoshop, you can group layers together and apply styles, blends, and transformations together. However, in After Effects, this is called Nesting.

Both are in a way similar to each other but Nesting Comps give users more functionality as it interprets probable compositions during the nesting process.

Smart objects used in PS are also comparable to Nested Comps as you can apply filters over one while applying effects to the other.

### 03Vector and Shapes

You can use the Pen tool or Shape tool in both PS and AE that creates shape layers without losing any integrity. Both the applications support Bezier which lets you control curves between anchor points in PS and vertices in AE.

### 04Destructive Effects

After Effects does not provide you with destructive effects while in Photoshop you can apply non-destructive filters. You can also combine several layers to apply changes or distort your images but these permanent changes cannot be made in After Effects.

You will also notice that although there are several similarities, there are tools and features which are not shared between both applications. The types of tool categories would also vary. Like with After Effects, you can create paragraph and character styles that you can apply to texts.

## Part 3 How to Create After Effects Gifs

After Effects harbors greater video editing capabilities rather than the basic animating options you can try on Photoshop. In creating a GIF, you would want to leverage the combination of tools offered on both After Effects and Photoshop.

Let’s first get into how you can create an animated video on After Effects and then convert it into an animated GIF in Photoshop.

### 01Animating in After Effects

**Step 1:** Open After Effects, go to ‘Composition’ and create ‘New Composition’. You will need to fill out the dimensions and specs for your project on the window that pops up. For example, 300x250 px at 30 fps and 6 sec duration.

![new composition after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** You can import assets by dragging and dropping, or by going to the ‘Project Panel’ in the After Effects Workspace as shown in the image.

![project panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, you can begin animating your Assets. Drag them and add them to the ‘Composition’ panel or ‘Timeline’ panel. Placing them in either one will make them appear on both. Adjust the layers according to the topmost layer on the panel.

![timeline panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-3.jpg)

Dial down the scale of every animation to 0% so that can be animated in a growing sequence. Select the layer you wish to adjust and click on ‘Transform’. Click on ‘Scale’ to give that layer an active marker on the timeline. Set the scale to 0%.

![set scale after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-4.jpg)

You can now begin animating the first item by moving the current time indicator to 06f (the 6th frame on the 30fps timeline). Scale the item back to 100% and the marker will reappear.

![set scale after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-5.jpg)

Repeat this for the other items. Keep in mind that each item has a 06f space between them for later adjustability.

![repeat process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-6.jpg)

Your equation is now complete and all that is left to do is animate your CTA button. Adjust the position of the top layer on your CTA and set the current time indicator to start time on the button animation. Click on ‘position’ to set up a marker on your Timeline. Forward the 04f then nudge the button and reverse back to the original position so that it looks like a button clicking animation.

![set position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-7.jpg)

Your animation is now complete. Now go to ‘Composition’ and shorten the time in the ‘Duration’ panel.

**Step 4:** Go to Composition. Click on Pre-Render and a new selection will pop up. Now click on ‘Render’. Your output will be a .mov file.

![render after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/how-to-create-after-effects-gifs-8.jpg)

If you find **exporting gifs from After Effects** too complicated, you can also upload and loop videos using **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** which has plenty of other amazing video editing features you can drag and drop to create.

## Keyframes Interval: Everything You Need To Know

Many people may not understand what the **Keyframe Interval** stands for. However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.

The **Keyframe Interval** is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.

**Keyframe Interval** is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we'll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.

## Part 1\. What Is Keyframe Interval

Keyframe Intervals, also known as "Keyframe Frequency" in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or "GOP size" by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation's file size, quality, and smoothness.

Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.

![keyframe interval in a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyframe-interval-in-a-video.png)

## Part 2\. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?

Keyframes are important in video and animation because they mark specific points in time that can be used to create a smooth and consistent transition between different states or images. The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.

In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are "difference" frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.

Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.

The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.

For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.

## Part 3\. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates

The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.

When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video's bitrate, the better the quality.

Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.

For example, if you're using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.

This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it's working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the [delta frames.](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes.)

## Part 4\. What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval

After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.

Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream's frame rate and bitrate. However, if you want to set the keyframe gap manually, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

* Set the frame interval at 2 seconds. Do not increase it from 4 seconds.
* Disable the "auto" keyframe feature.
* To allow for b-frames, use an encoding profile higher than baseline and use IDR-based keyframes.

## Part 5\. How To Change The Keyframe Interval On OBS Studio

Above is the basic knowledge of the keyframe interval. Then, how to apply it to your real video-editing work? In this part, we will choose OBS to show you the application process.

OBS Studio is a powerful yet free and open-source screen recorder and live streaming tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux. One of the most useful features of OBS Studio is its ability to change the keyframe interval on the fly without having to restart your recording or stream.

The process for changing the it in OBS Studio has been made more efficient since the classic version. However, some users may have trouble locating the new setting.

Here's how to change the it on OBS Studio:

Step1 Launch the **OBS Studio** on your PC or laptop.

![launching the obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/launching-the-obs-studio.png)

Step2 From the bottom right of the screen, open the **"Settings"** menu.

![obs studio settings menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/obs-studio-settings-menu.png)

Step3 On the Settings Window, click **"Output"** and configure the output mode to **"Advanced."**

![setting the output mode to advance in obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/setting-the-output-mode-to-advance-in-obs-studio.png)

Step4 Finally, edit the **Keyframe Interval,** set it to **2** seconds, and click **"OK"** to save your changes.

![changing the keyframe interval value on obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/changing-the-keyframe-interval-value-on-obs-studio.png)

## Part 6\. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?

When you try to set the keyframe gap by yourself, you may feel confused about the difference a higher or lower interval make to your video. Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?

In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.

Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.

A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.

For instance, you don't need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.

## Easy Way to Create an Alternate Reality Effect

Ditch boring one-dimensional videos and create a mesmerizing video with this alternative reality effect you can easily create using Wondershare Filmora.

This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?

Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.

![a preview of the alternate reality effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-1.gif)

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

## Editing the video

If you have your footage or stock video ready, then you can start editing. Follow this simple step-by-step guide to create your own alternate reality using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## What You Should Know About Speech-to-Text Technology

Speech-to-text technology (**STT**) improves communication, especially in a multi-language setting. One of the ways we practice multilingualism is via **speech-to-text technology:** speakers input a language, and viewers read another language. Other advantages include converting oral speech into a document, real-time compatibility, and offline usage. This article explains how you can utilize **speech-to-text assistance** technology for optimal productivity.

![speech to text technology](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology.jpg)

## Part 1: What is speech-to-text technology?

Speech-to-text technology (STT) identifies oral pronunciation and converts them into computer codes: electronic words. The computer electro-communication requires a medium of conversion: receiver and interpreter. Therefore, speech-to-text technology contains both the receiver and interpreter, which exist electronically. The medium or receiver can be software installed on a device; it must have a receiver and a screen. The computer serves a good purpose, although other devices can receive words without displaying them.

A speech-to-text technology does not necessarily have to contain displaying screen: a sound interpreter may replace the screen. Thus, speech-to-text can be oral words - electronic recognition - word encoding - display, or recitation. Oral wordings are the human's contribution to speech-to-text technology, although all communication (especially speech) may be generated from a computer. Inter-device communication is another advancement of speech-to-text technology. For example, combining one or more devices allow you to use speech-to-text assistance technology in different languages.

Communication is the paramount importance in speech-to-text technology. Still, some advantages include easy data conversion, documentation, workflow flexibility, and easy access to data. For example, documentation is incomplete if every human cannot access the file. All humans cannot read; improvising data into oral documents reduces the percentage of people who cannot access the file. Speech-to-text increases the channel for less privileged individuals. For instance, the deaf who cannot listen to a recorded file can read the file via speech-to-text technology.

Speech-to-text technology incorporates many advantages. Learning to use the technology is the first step in familiarizing and getting yourself equipped.

## Part 2: What are the stages for the technology?

STT gives so many stages and applications for a daily and smooth organization. Some include:

### 1\. Education

Education and the love to study other languages increase with speech-to-text technology. The educative application is not limited to four corners of the room; it extends to all daily learning activities. Communication is educative if you learn new things via communication.

STT improves all processes associated with less privileged education. For example, everyone easily pours their mind into a computer screen page when they speak, especially in the language they understand using STT. Time and submission date are important factors in the educational system; STT improves time, submission, accuracy, and authentication.

### 2\. Video Subtitles

Videography and filmmaking carry a large percentage of today's media. Data input and integration in the video-making process weigh a lot, and the concept of STT reduces the load on the data specialist. Instead of long hours of typing, oral communication is applicable. Processing time is a factor of productivity; STTs do not only affect the time of production but also maintain accuracy.

### 3\. Chatbots

Chatbots are available on websites. Users have different preferences: some can type while others like to communicate via speech. The chatbots attend to users' needs; you can do more with STT if installed on the website. STT promotes freedom of communication and increases user interaction on your website. STT may be incorporated into mobile applications too. There is more to STT, and the advantage is unlimited if you add it to your chatbots.

## Part 3\. Free Premiere Filter Presets to Use

Adobe Premiere Pro comes with a handful of video filters. However, you can add various free Premiere Pro filter presets and apply them to your video. Here is the list of the free Premiere Pro filter presets to use on your video.

**Retro Preset Pack -**

There is a craze to have retro filters on the video so that the video looks different and takes the audience back to the golden old days. This is a collection of filter presets where you can get different old-school styles. Starting from VHS filter effect to RGB split, there are ample filter presets to make your video look retro.

**Cinematic LUT Pack -**

There is no doubt that cinematic videos always look class apart from the rest of the videos and this is the perfect collection of video filters you need. Use these filters to deepen and sharpen colors and cut down brightness so that the video becomes eye-catching and eye-soothing. This is a must-have video filter you should have in Premiere Pro so that you can make regular videos look extraordinary.

**Panoramic Transitions Pack -**

Transitions are a part of video filters in Premiere Pro and if you want something different in transition effects, you should opt for Panoramic transitions. Starting from fish-eye effect to spinning effect, you can apply them when you move from one scene to another or one clip to another.

**Free Animated Text Preset Pack -**

Text is an important part of any video and you need video filter presets to apply to the textual part. Instead of the regular text filters, the animated text presets are extremely eye-catching. Starting from shake animations to bounce animations, 13 free animation titles can transform your video especially the part where texts are the main highlights.

**Glitch Effects Pack -**

If you make videos for social media or you make informational videos, glitch effects must be in your videos. You can get quick attention of your audience with glitch effects, make scene transitions, and add some comedy scenes. Your video will have some extra kick and look more interesting to watch.

## Conclusion

If you are using Adobe Premiere Pro to edit your videos, adding filters to your videos could be quite common. We have illustrated how to add filter to video in Premiere Pro to enhance your video quality and outlook. We have also listed the must-have free Premiere Pro filter presents.

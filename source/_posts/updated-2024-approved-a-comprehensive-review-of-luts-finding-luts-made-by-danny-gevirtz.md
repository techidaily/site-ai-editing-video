LUTs are like magic formulas that make your videos and images look better. They tweak the colors and tones in your footage to create a new visual experience. Following are the basic details of using and applying LUTs in basic video editing operations.

**Types of LUTs**

* **Technical LUTs:** These are for technical stuff like adjusting color spaces or correcting gamma. They ensure your colors and tones stay consistent across different devices and platforms.
* **Creative LUTs:** This type is a fun type of LUT. Creative LUTs help you achieve specific looks or styles. They can make your videos look like they were shot on film or create different moods and visual effects.

**Apply LUTs with the Correct LUT Format**

You can apply LUTs using different video editing software. For instance, there is Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, and others to apply LUT. Just load the LUT and apply it to your video clips or the whole project. Moreover, you can make adjustments to the LUT according to your preference.

In addition, LUTs come in different file formats, such as .cube, .3dl, .look, or .icc. The most common one is .cube. Furthermore, different video editing tools support different formats. Moreover, choose the right format for your editing software and the colors you want.

The great thing about LUTs is that they don't mess with your original video file. They're like a layer that sits on top, making real-time changes during playback or rendering. Moreover, you can always return to the original footage or make further adjustments without losing data.

## [Step by Step] to Rotate Video in Google Photos

Google photos let you store, view, edit and share your videos and photos and are automatically organized. It is a very great cloud storage service and most people use it. Google Photos has introduced an artificial intelligence technology into the app. That’s why it can automatically organize and rotate.

You have videos on google photos that are automatically rotated, others are not.

How do you rotate them manually?

It’s is so simple and will not take much of your time.

Let’s dive in…

## **Rotating videos in google photos**

Rotating a video in google photos is pretty simple and will not take much of your time. You can easily fix the rotation and aspect ratio of your videos. But it’s a little tricky.

I'm going to show you how to flip your videos from portrait mode to landscape mode or from landscape mode to portrait mode.

You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you're going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-1.png)

You will see a diamond with a circular arrow on it. You're going to hit that until you find the way you want it to be.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-2.png)

Once you're happy, in the top right hand corner, hit Save Copy and that's it, the size of the file determines how long it takes to finish this process later.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-3.png)

## **An easier way to rotate videos in Google Photos**

If you just need to rotate a video in portrait mode to the landscape mode or 180 degrees, Google photos will be the best choice to do that. However, what if rotate a video 32 degrees or 157 degrees, or maybe you need to do more editing operations, you can’t rely on Google Photos anymore.

But stop worrying, you can set your video at any angle with [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . It is one of the best video editing software that provides you with the editing tools you need to edit and share your videos across the globe.

Here’s How to do it…

### Rotate video at any angle

You can also rotate the video by using the **Transform** tab located at the top right corner.

* Drag your video into the **timeline**.
* Double click on the video to bring up the **editing panel**.
* Hit the **basic** tab under the **video** tab in the menu bar.
* Select the **Transform**
* Click the **rotate**
* Here you can move the rotate slider or directly enter the rotating value.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-4.png)

You will notice that I have changed the rotation of my video from its original position to the rotated angle.

You can rotate upside down, rotate left, rotate right or 90 degrees clockwise, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, 360 degrees rotate, and back to the original. Check the video result in the preview window. Once you get satisfied with the rotation.

* Hit the **ok**
* Select the **save**

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-5.png)

Similarly, you can drag the video from the preview panel and adjust it as required.

Here, you can **Flip** function your video to change the direction. Like in this screenshot, suppose you want to change the place from right to left. You can easily change the direction by hitting on the flip tab.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-6.png)

Now you can see that the image has flipped without making a big effort you can also do it. I have done it for you, you are smarter.

Just go ahead and start…

 Scale is also used to remove the unwanted and rubbish scenes from the selected video. Like if you don’t want to show something behind the scene, you can use the scale function to cut that scene from your video.

### **What’s more you can do with Filmora**

**Changing the Aspect ratio**

After you rotate the video at an angle you like. You can change the aspect ratio of the video furthermore.

* **Import** the desired video and drag it into the **timeline**. Then click the Aspect Ratio icon at the bottom of the preview window.
* You can select the 16:9, 1:1, 4:3, or custom aspect ratio.
* Press **OK**

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-7.png)

By the way, you can choose the suitable aspect ratio according to the social media platform you are using. Like, a 1:1 aspect ratio for Instagram, a 9:16 aspect ratio for portrait videos, and a 4:3 standard video.

## **Conclusion**

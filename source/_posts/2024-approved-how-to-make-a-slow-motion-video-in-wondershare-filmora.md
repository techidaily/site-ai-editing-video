## How To Polish Your Music Video Edits Using Filmora

A common understanding in cinematography circles is that editing makes the seventy percent of the total job. It is editing that makes a significant difference, and Filmora, a professional video editor, comes in handy when you want to edit your photos.

Filmora has multiple features that allow you to shine your videos in countless ways. This article will clarify everything you need to improve your music video. Also, it is just the tip of the iceberg. The more you try to be creative, the more options Filmora will provide you. The following points highlight how you can polish your music video editing skills.

## Part 1\. Duplicate your project before editing

Before you begin unleashing your inner creativity, you must make a duplicate copy of your project file. Of course, it would help if you did so to keep a backup file.

It will help you get back to the pre-edit file if you want to start from the beginning or if you want to save the file for use in the future. You can make a duplicate file of your project by following the subsequent steps.

##### Step1Download and install Filmora

You can download Filmora from its [official website.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step2Create or import your project

* Create a project if you are using Filmora for the first time.
* Import the project from your computer directory. Then, go to **file** in the menu bar, and click on the open project.

![opening a project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/opening-a-project.jpg)

* Select the project you want to open.

##### Step3Duplicate the project file and rename it

* When you open Filmora, a start-up window will appear.
* Right-click on the project you want to duplicate.

![making a duplicate file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/making-a-duplicate-file-in-flimora.jpg)

##### Step4Rename the duplicate file

* Rename the file to keep a record of new editions.

![rename the file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/rename-the-file-in-filmora.jpg)

The file is renamed. It will help you remember which file is original. If your files become corrupted, you can easily access the original ones.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

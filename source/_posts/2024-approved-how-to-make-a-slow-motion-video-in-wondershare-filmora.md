## How To Polish Your Music Video Edits Using Filmora

A common understanding in cinematography circles is that editing makes the seventy percent of the total job. It is editing that makes a significant difference, and Filmora, a professional video editor, comes in handy when you want to edit your photos.

Filmora has multiple features that allow you to shine your videos in countless ways. This article will clarify everything you need to improve your music video. Also, it is just the tip of the iceberg. The more you try to be creative, the more options Filmora will provide you. The following points highlight how you can polish your music video editing skills.

## Part 1\. Duplicate your project before editing

Before you begin unleashing your inner creativity, you must make a duplicate copy of your project file. Of course, it would help if you did so to keep a backup file.

It will help you get back to the pre-edit file if you want to start from the beginning or if you want to save the file for use in the future. You can make a duplicate file of your project by following the subsequent steps.

##### Step1Download and install Filmora

You can download Filmora from its [official website.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step2Create or import your project

* Create a project if you are using Filmora for the first time.
* Import the project from your computer directory. Then, go to **file** in the menu bar, and click on the open project.

![opening a project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/opening-a-project.jpg)

* Select the project you want to open.

##### Step3Duplicate the project file and rename it

* When you open Filmora, a start-up window will appear.
* Right-click on the project you want to duplicate.

![making a duplicate file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/making-a-duplicate-file-in-flimora.jpg)

##### Step4Rename the duplicate file

* Rename the file to keep a record of new editions.

![rename the file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/rename-the-file-in-filmora.jpg)

The file is renamed. It will help you remember which file is original. If your files become corrupted, you can easily access the original ones.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

From the beginning of this piece until now, all we have discussed is getting or making a GIF. However, we will define the simplest way to make your profile pic a GIF in Discord in this case. Ensure that you read through this section.

Generally, discord nitro users are more privileged compared to normal discord users. Of course, the Nitro subscribers pay a fee to access these privileges. There are two options:

**●** Making your profile picture a GIF

**●** Utilizing the Tenor GIFs

**●** Uploading them from your files

### 02How to create your profile picture a GIF?

Step 1: Log into your Discord account

Step 2: Visit the user settings gear icon and go to edit profile to access your account details.

Step 3: Click on your current profile or click on the Change Avatar option

Step 5: Use the available GIF search engine or upload files from your device. It depends on whether you are a Nitro subscriber or a normal user. Select your GIF and go to the Apply option to save the file

Step 6: Move to the escape button to exit the settings, and you realize that your PFP is officially a GIF.

## Part 4 **How to Put a GIF in Discord profile Picture?**

Discord is quite a popular platform with millions of users worldwide. Thanks to the user-friendly interface it includes, this number is enormous, especially when you wish to edit your profile picture. In our case, we explain facts about having a GIF as a PFP in discord.

Like most social media platforms, this process is relatively easy. It only requires you to be a discord user, and it is better if you are a nitro subscriber. Why? Because the latter have the discord GIF options easing the process. Note that you can still add a GIF even without nitro.

The first point is to log into your account, go to setting and click on the edit your profile option. Upon clicking on the available PFP, you will automatically access a file dialogue that prompts you to include your GIF. Later save these changes and get **a GIF profile in discord.**

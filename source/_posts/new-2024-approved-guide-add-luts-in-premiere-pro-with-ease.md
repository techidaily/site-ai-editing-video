## Twitch Green Screen Guide

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished. With Twitch green screen background, you can easily configure Chroma key settings and detect your green screen with a single click.

The twitch green screen attaches directly to the back of your chair. You don't have to worry about stands, or spacing behind your chair. Just attach it and go. This portable green screen can fit on the back of your chair a feature that makes it easy to assemble and use for start-up twitchers.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

## How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion  & Free LUTs Resource

LumaFusion is one of the most complex iPad and iPhone video editing apps. Many of its customers adore it, and it has some incredible capabilities that you'd find incompetent editing software. They've effectively opened up the realm of LUTs to iPhone and iPad users.

LumaFusion LUTs are individual files that act as containers in LumaFusion. This container file includes standard LUT data as well as LumaFusion-specific color preset data. A LumaFusion LUT Preset file is similar to a Super LUT. LumaFusion can only employ one standard LUT at a time; however, LumaFusion LUT presets enable simultaneous Color Grading and Color Corrections.

## How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion

Colors in today's cameras are vibrant, but they may continuously be improved. Color correction corrects the color that's already there, whether it's boosting the exposure to brighten a darker photo or increasing the saturation to make the colors pop. Color correction in other NLEs can be difficult, but not in LumaFusion.

The Color Presets tab in the Color & Effects section is where you begin color correcting footage. There are various presets from which to pick. I wouldn't use these settings on my videos because they're too stylized, but they're there. You may alter any of the presets to your taste, so some of the more dramatic ones can be toned down. By picking the original setting, purists can color-fix their raw footage without using LumaFusion. Moving the sliders till the color seems perfect is all that's required from there.

Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, mid-tones, and saturation and hue are all controlled by sliders. The color sliders can be used for a more forceful approach. But proceed with caution. The sliders are delicate, and it's easy to overdo them. Play around with the sliders until you get the look you want. If you don't like it, toss it in the trashcan and start over.

Color grading and color correction are not interchangeable terms. Color correction is a technical requirement, but color grading is primarily creative. You'll have no command over the color grading process if you're working with film material where primary colors aren't even visible. Before diving into the creative LUTs, make sure you complete adequate color correcting.

Color grading, unlike color correction, adjusts the shot's color to modify the atmosphere or feel. The only way to do that in LumaFusion is to play around with the color sliders under the Color Presets tab, but that's not ideal. As previously stated, the three sliders are sensitive and limited. LumaFusion isn't designed for color grading, which is OK. Thankfully, LumaFusion allows you to use LUTs.

Always color correct your footage before utilizing any LUTS, which entails changing the White-balance, Highlights, Contrast, and Shadows. Do not apply the LUTS to your footage directly.

## How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?

Videographers, colorists, and editors use LUTs because they are efficient. Rather than starting from zero every time you work on a video editing project, you may speed up the color grading process using a LUT with predefined color profiles. It's elementary to import LUTs. Simply import the preset files into LumaFusion and add the preset to your footage like an Instagram filter.

The Import button in the Color & Effects editor is the easiest way to load LUTs.

1. Double click on any video/photo clip on the timeline to access the Clip Editors.
2. At the bottom of the Clip Editor UI, select the Color & Effects tab.
3. The import button is located directly below the effect preset library.

LUTs must be loaded via the LumaFX clip editor at the moment. Follow the steps below to accomplish this:

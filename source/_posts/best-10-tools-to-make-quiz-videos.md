## 6 Best Text to Speech Generators for YouTube Videos [Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone & Online]

#### Best Text To Speech Converter and Video Editor

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

## **#1:** [Murf](https://murf.ai/)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online**

Murf is a text-based voice-over maker. You can either compose your script or submit a voice clip to convert it into hyper-realistic AI voices. Murf delivers expert voice-over artists with experienced voices. You can check multiple parameters in the voices. You can use Murf to signify a brand, a product, a company, a presentation, and many more.

![text-to-speech-youtube-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/text-to-speech-youtube-1.jpg)

### **Features:**

* Murf allows you to create voice-overs from the text. It also allows you to transform your speech into editable text, which you can subsequently edit or convert into AI voice.
* Murf Studio provides the ability to synchronize your speech with visuals.
* Murf provides over 100 authentic voices in 19 languages.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

* The paid version is very expensive in comparison to others.

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

### Cons

* It does not have a preview. You have to generate the voice-over to listen.
* You can't combine a single audio file out of many audio files.
* The Voiceover & Editor Page is unique in that it has two sections: one for creating the voice-over and another for obtaining audio files. Switching between them will take some time. If you're working on a large project, moving between bot sites will be a hassle.
* No project-based organization

### Cons

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

You should check for text-to-speech software with natural voices enabled in commercial applications. A top-rated system should include real-time speech capabilities and a user-friendly UI.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

### Cons

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

You should check for text-to-speech software with natural voices enabled in commercial applications. A top-rated system should include real-time speech capabilities and a user-friendly UI.

## **Text to Speech Services' Advantages**

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

## Cropping a Video in Final Cut Pro [Step by Step]

“Storytelling at its most powerful”, - words we read on the first page of the official web-site of Final Cut Pro, non-linear video editing software program which runs on Mac computers. The software lets us to log and transfer videos onto a hard drive, where it can be edited, processed, and output to a wide variety of formats. Final Cut Pro is so advanced that it is used by hobbyist filmmakers and industry professionals in TV, Film, and media. Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99\. It’s evident that Final Cut Pro can’t be downloaded, installed, and thus used on Windows, which is unfortunate, but for Mac users, it’s a very powerful video editing software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-1.jpeg)

What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:

* Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;
* Blazing pro performance;
* Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;
* The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.

One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.

The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM), with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-2.jpeg)

Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-23.jpeg)

Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!

## How to Add Video Transitions in Videos

Editing a video is equally important as recording a video. A raw video footage is never appealing to the eyes because of sudden cuts, unnecessary parts, and lack of eye-catching effects. That is why video editing is crucial for turning an unappealing raw video into an attention-grabbing video. As a matter of fact, the way you edit your video makes your video stand out when you are posting on social media platforms.

One of the most important aspects of video editing is adding transitions to video clips. When you jump from one scene to another and make sudden cuts, you need to apply some video transitions so that the move from one scene to another becomes soothing to the eyes. Different video editors have different transition effects and [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has the best collection of transitions. We will illustrate how to add transition in Filmora and how to improve your video with video transitions.

## Part 1\. What is a Video transition effect?

A video transition effect is the most commonly used graphical effect in video editing. A video transition effect is essential whereby you connect one shot to another, especially when you are making sudden cuts in the video. Therefore, a video transition effect sits in between two shots and connects them together smoothly so that it does not look odd to the eyes. Video editing with transitions is a common practice for short videos on social media, presentation videos, and even movies.

A video transition effect is effective when you are jumping from two moods and emotions in the video. It is equally useful while jumping between storylines, points of view, and timelines. Besides, you can spice up your narrative and make your video eye-catching as well as eye-soothing. There are different types of video transition effects such as fade in and out, zoom in and out, dissolve, wipe and pan.

## Part 2\. How to add transitions in video?

To add transitions to your video, you will need a video editor. You should choose a video editor that has a wide collection of transition effects so that you can apply them to your video as per your preference. If you are someone who regularly makes videos and edits them, a variety of transitions will make the videos look different. There are Movie Maker transitions for Windows users and iMovie transitions for Mac users. But we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as the best video editor for adding transitions.

Here are the steps how to add transition in Filmora.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

## Part 3\. Video transitions tips and tricks

If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.

**Consistency** – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.

**Experiment** – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.

**Out of the Box** – The reason you recommended [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.

**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.

**Meaningful** – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood. Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.

## The Bottom Line

Video transition effects are essential in almost all types of videos. They enhance the video content and make the transition between scenes smoother. You should choose your video editor wisely so that you can avail different types of video transition effects. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for its better collection of video transition effects for all types of videos.

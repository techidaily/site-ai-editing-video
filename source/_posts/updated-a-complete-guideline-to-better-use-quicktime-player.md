Once you know how QuickTime Player makes it easy for Mac users to play their video, it is time to understand the steps associated with the procedure. Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:

Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.

![select quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-1.jpg)

![tap on open button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-2.jpg)

Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach. If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.

Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.

![choose your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-3.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Do Screen Recording with QuickTime?

Several functions can be performed across QuickTime. While the QuickTime video format allows you to play different videos across the platform, it also helps users record screens of their choice. To understand the step-by-step procedure, you need to follow the steps displayed below. Come along and learn more about it.

Step 1: Open QuickTime Player on your device and tap on the "File" tab on the top of the screen. Select the option of "New Screen Recording" from the available options to initiate screen recording.

![select new screen recording option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-5.jpg)

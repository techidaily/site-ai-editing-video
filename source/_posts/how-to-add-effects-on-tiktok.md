The program enables users to apply effects to TikTok videos in order to facilitate this kind of production. TikTok offers a lot of features, making it simple to become lost inside the application. The utilization of TikTok's built-in effects is one of the elements that contributes to their films' engaging nature.

With this guide you can add effects to your video to make it more visually appealing; this is one of the best possibilities.

## Part 1\. Using TikTok In-App Effects

If you use Tik Tok often, you undoubtedly already know that this app has several effects available as well. These consist of stickers, time effects, video coverings, and filter effects. As soon as you record or submit a video clip, these effects are readily triggered. Simply locate the "Effects" option to begin adding them to your movie. However, using text or caption effects is not possible in this manner. However, it is a useful method for improving your Tik Tok video before sharing it.

## Part 2\. Adding Effects Before Recording

Many people are hesitant to record a TikTok video with more than one filter effect applied. You've probably seen that a lot of well-known makers create videos that combine many different effects. Actually, the procedure is rather easy. You may apply as many filters as you'd like on the TikTok app while recording time stamps one at a time only! It is not feasible or the option is not presently accessible on the app if you wish to apply many effects at once.

**Steps to Add Effects to TikTok Videos Before Recording:**

Step1 Open the TikTok app and click the Create button in the lower-middle of the screen.

![tap create new video tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-create-new-video-tiktok.jpg)

Step2 On the right side of the screen, tap Filters. The screen's bottom will reveal a pop-up menu for filters.

Step3 To see the choices, swipe. By tapping the tabs, you may quickly navigate to that particular set of filters. Alternatively, you may just swipe and browse through each choice. Select a filter by tapping it. To lessen or intensify the filter effect, move the slider to the left or right.

## Part 3\. Adding Effects After Recording

Forgot to use a filter effect before to beginning your recording? Not to worry! On the Preview page, you may also apply a filter to your clips. By selecting Visual under Effects after recording or uploading your TikTok video, you may also add some lovely dynamic filter effects. You may achieve that by saving the films to your camera roll after applying each effect individually to the same clip. then launch the app's video recorder, add the previously recorded video, and choose a new filter to apply to the video clip.

**Steps to Add Effects to TikTok After Recording:**

Step1 The first step is to launch the program on your phone and touch the "+" icon. Simply choose a filter effect for your movie by going right to the Filters section here.

![tap add icon tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-add-icon-tiktok.jpg)

Step2 The filters button, which is indicated by three circles, must be tapped in the second stage. You may choose the TikTok effect you wish to use once all of the effects are shown on the screen.

![choose effects tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-effects-tiktok.jpg)

Step3 You have access to a wide variety of effects once you enter the effects gallery. Select the effect that best suits your video and that you prefer. After making your decision, leave the effects gallery and upload the recording.

## Part 4\. Add Filter on Video in TikTok

You may apply the filters after you film the movie, just as you do with the effects. You just need to visit visual. There is no way to identify the filter that your favorite TikToker used on his video on TikTok. Don't worry, they often include the effect they employ in the hashtag or description, so you are still welcome to utilize it. To hunt for filter effects on TikTok, you might request a search function.

**Steps to Add Filter on Videos in TikTok:**

Step1 Click the "+" symbol in the bottom menu's center after launching the TikTok app on your phone. Press the "+" button to start your camera before applying a specific filter.

![add filter tiktok videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-filter-tiktok-videos.jpg)

Step4 You may apply the filter to your video after you have officially made your decision. After doing this, leave the filter gallery and begin recording your video. Now that all of these procedures have been completed, you are able to capture your video with the effect on it.

## The Bottom Line

Filters on TikTok work similarly to filters on other social media applications. However, there is no option or function in the TikTok app that allows you to look for a filter effect under the Filters or Effects tab. However, since most TikTok users constantly upload videos with any filter and strive to put the filter's name and hashtags on the films, you may search for some videos with the identical filter. Your films will get flair and individuality thanks to this simple technique, which also gives certain filters a chance to catch on as trends.

## How to Create Video in Text Intro?

Have you ever seen videos on social media apps or movies and seen a video in text like the title as the intro? The highly appealing and unique style makes the video introduction stand out. Not to mention, it creates an illusion of almost-transparent titles that showcase the video playing in a subdued manner in the background, thereby showcasing a modern, funky intro.

![the example of text intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-0.gif)

Now, are you planning to create an effect such as that on your own video project?

## How to Take Slow Motion Videos

Scenes that might otherwise be monotonous can be made more interesting by the use of slow-motion photography in movies and television shows. For instance, a battle sequence between two characters can be portrayed in its entirety, but if it is later replayed in slow motion, the intensity of the action is amplified significantly.

Let’s dive in!

## 1\. What is slow motion?

Filmmakers use the slow-motion effect to create the illusion that the passage of time has been slowed down on the screen. In the early 20th century, an Austrian priest named August Musger was the one who came up with the idea. Playing normally recorded material at a slower pace is another method for creating the illusion of slow motion.

When a film is recorded at 25 frames per second, but played back at 24 frames per second, it will seem as if it is being shown in slow motion because all of the movements will be slightly slower than when they were actually performed. This is because the film was recorded at 25 frames per second, but the playback was done at 24 frames per second.

Because there are not enough frames to show all of the details of each frame when a 24-frame animation is played at a 25-frame rate (or a 30-frame animation at a 32-frame rate), certain frames have to be repeated (every 5th one in this case). When there is a dramatic event taking place, this manipulation of the film speed makes the action on screen appear even more dramatic or "tensioned."

![what is a slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-a-slow-motion-video.jpg)

## 2\. Understanding frame rates

When filming video, there are a set number of frames per second that you can choose from. One picture is all you get when you take a still photograph. Click. That is only one example. A frame is the name of that picture. With video, however, you take 30 or 24 images per second, which you then combine. You now have footage.

The video is a combination of tens of thousands of frames or images that are flashing before your eyes. With a normal frame rate of 24 frames per second, you are essentially taking 24 pictures per second and stitching them together to create video. When you stretch it out in post for slow motion, you double or triple the frame rate, which results in more images per second and eliminates empty gaps and jarring actions.

This is how video that has been sped up for slow motion may still preserve its quality. But you can't just choose a frame rate based on taste. Frame rates vary depending on the different types of emotions. 60 fps will do if the video is a slo-mo of a person's emotion. However, if your shot contains a lot of movement and you want to show it, such as when automobiles collide or explode, you may require a higher frame rate, such as 120 fps.

![understand frame rates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/understand-frame-rates.jpg)

## 3\. Post processing

This is when it gets a bit complicated. Some cameras come equipped with a slow-motion feature. To capture the video in slow motion at a higher frame rate, go to your settings. You might not have this built-in slow-motion feature in other models.

Therefore, even though the footage was taken at a higher frame rate, the camera is playing the movie back at the same pace it was shot at, so when you shoot at a higher frame rate, you end up with footage of a normal speed. There is a solution to that. The footage's speed can be adjusted during post-production.

The 24/30 fps editing timelines are pre-set. The majority of the video you capture at this frame rate plays back just nicely on this timeline. You must stretch out video that was shot at a higher frame rate to match this timeline, though. That effectively doubles or triples the length of a video, depending on the multiple of the timeline's typical frame rate.

![post processing filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/post-processing-filmora.jpg)

## 4\. Lighting

While watching TV or movies, you might have observed anything. The majority of the extremely slow photos happen in broad daylight. Not after dark or in dimly lit areas. The reason for this is that sufficient lighting is required in order to capture motion. Lighting becomes crucial as your frame rate exceeds 300 frames per second. Therefore, if you must take these pictures, you must do so in a studio environment with lots of artificial lighting.

To create that cinematic magic, you can use high CRI lighting. On the screen, a flickering light may spell doom. Flickering lights have the potential to damage slow-motion film even though they would be OK for any other scene. Because there is no risk of voltage fluctuation, LED lights are a safe bet. The reason for this is that some models do not require an electrical outlet to function. Prior to departure, make sure you have checked each and every light.

If you are filming during the day and you point your camera toward the sun, you may end up with a significant amount of glare that cannot be hidden up in the post-production stage nor can it be ignored. This is not merely a problem that occurs throughout the daytime. Flares can also be obtained from moving vehicles and various other sources of light. If you use a flat lens when you're out at night, you can eliminate the risk of something like that happening.

![choose light for slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-light-for-slow-motion-video.jpg)

## 5\. Why use slow motion?

When you first begin working with slow-motion video, you need to ask yourself, "What exactly is the purpose behind me choosing this effect?" Once you have an answer to that question, you may move on to the next step.

**In most cases, there are often two primary causes for it.**

1\. It makes sense to present emotions on the screen for a longer period of time in order for the audience to be able to absorb and comprehend it in its whole if they are shown for a longer period of time since moments that are packed with emotions seem to endure longer than ordinary ones.

2\. The second strategy is to draw attention to striking visuals that you might have overlooked in other circumstances and that contribute significantly to the aesthetic value of your setting. A flutter of the eyelid, a butterfly stretching its wings, rains falling on a flower petal, shards of fire breaking free, etc. are all examples of how quickly things may happen. You need to have a good reason for using slow motion, and you shouldn't abuse the effect too much too. You should only do so at those moments where it makes logical sense to do so.

![draw attention with slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/draw-attention-with-slow-motion-video.jpg)

Subconscious slow-motion. Overusing or misusing a function ruins its appeal. Filming isn't an exact science, but it does nothing unnecessary. For a cinematic effect, slow-motion should be introduced carefully.

As of now, Alight Motion offers 100+ effects that you can use to enhance your videos and make them stand out. These effects include a wide range of motion graphics, visual effects, and animation tools. Some of the effects available in Alight Motion include shaking effects, panning, zooming, rotation, color correction, and many more.

The app is regularly updated, so the number of effects available may increase over time. The wide range of effects gives you the power to create dynamic and visually engaging videos. With Alight Motion, the possibilities are endless.

### Q3\. Is 8GB RAM Enough for Alight Motion?

8GB of RAM is generally enough for running Alight Motion, although the app's recommended minimum is 2GB of RAM. Having more RAM would allow for smoother performance and the ability to handle larger and more complex projects. However, with 8GB of RAM, you should still be able to run Alight Motion without any major issues.

## Conclusion

Alight Motion and Filmora for mobile are powerful video editing apps that offer a wide range of features and effects. Each app has its strengths and weaknesses, and it ultimately depends on your specific needs and preferences.

Alight Motion offers more shake effects, while Filmora for mobile offers more simplicity. Both apps can be used to create high-quality and professional-looking videos. It's recommended to try both apps and see which one works best for you.

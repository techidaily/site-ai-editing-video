## Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured

You can use GIF makers to create loops in videos you upload but the trick to making your 3D GIF stand out is about to be explained in the following.

**●** **Step 1:** Choosing an Image.

Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels.

The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.

**●** **Step 5:** Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.

From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.

**●** **Step 6:** For the final touch.

Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.

## Do You Have the Habit to Create Subtitle for Your Video? You Can Always Add Open and Close Subtitles to Your Video to Make It Perfect. Follow This Article to Learn More About It

Subtitles are very common for people who watch videos very often. It is simply the text or dialogue usually displayed at the base of the screen of a video. We often use subtitles to watch movies or television programs, play video games, etc. The subtitle makes all the difference when you are watching a video in a language different from the one you know and understand.

A lot of videos will be really difficult to watch when there is no knowledge of the language which the producers used in creating the video. That is where the need for subtitles is seen. It breaks language barriers to publicity of a video i.e it tries to bridge that gap of understanding that exists when you watch a video. It also assists in as little as helping you understand a video that is recorded in a language you speak but in a different accent. An American might find it a bit difficult to understand the accent used in a British movie. So basically, what subtitles do is make understanding better and easier.

## 1\. Types of Subtitle Videos

There are two (2) broad types of subtitling

1. Open Subtitles
2. Closed subtitles

**Open Subtitles**

Open subtitles are subtitles that are included and incorporated as part of the original video and cannot be removed from the screen. No additional program or tool is required before they are activated and ready for use. Also, no additional tool is needed to edit or remove it. This is because they are part and parcel of the original video and cannot be edited. They are rooted in the original video as part of it and not just as an extension. An example of where it is used is karaoke. These subtitles cannot be switched on and off by the user.

**Close Subtitles**

Closed subtitles are more malleable than open subtitles. It is relatively easier to add or remove when compared to the open subtitles. They are substantially separate from the original video. They are usually encoded in the transmission signal of the cable or satellite technology and sent separately from the original broadcast, in this case, video. This makes it possible to remove it from the video. They are mostly found on DVDs.

Other classifications sometimes include a third known as soft subtitles. They usually need player support to work effectively. They are the easiest to use because of the flexibility in adding and editing.

## 2\. Subtitle Formats

Subtitle formats are often represented funnily. You see extensions like .srt, .sub, .stl, .mtv, etc. They are the extensions of different subtitle formats. Let’s talk about some of them.

**SubRip:** This is one of the most common formats for subtitles. Its extension is ‘.srt’ and they are also the most widely used by modern video subtitling technology. It is stored sequentially along a line with its basic timing and in a human-readable format.

**SubViewer:** The sub viewer format is another popular subtitle format. It stores information about periods with tag information. Its extension is ‘.sub’.

**Micro DVD:** This subtitle format is compatible with digital videos. They equally carry the ‘. sub’ extension.

**Spruce subtitle format:** They usually operate in sequential periods and frames. They have the ‘.stl’ format.

## 3\. What Are Subtitles Used For?

Now that we’ve known what subtitles are and the various formats they exist in, let’s take a deeper dive into what they’re used for.

**Marketing:**

You’re probably wondering what marketing is doing at the top of this list. If you work in a multi-national company which branches in different countries and continents, you will find subtitles very helpful in promotional videos for your company. On the other hand, you may not work in a multi-national company but have your business in a multi-ethnic country like Nigeria, New Guinea, Chad, etc. instead of creating videos in all the languages which apply to the people you hope to reach, you can produce one video, add subtitles for the various languages and save cost.

**Education:**

Educational videos can be produced alongside subtitles in various languages to aid learning, especially for campuses that attract foreign students who might have little to no knowledge of how to speak the language of the school.

**Understanding better deaf people:**

Subtitle for Deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH) was introduced by the movie industry specifically made for people with hearing deficiencies. This allows them access to information they would normally be unable to hear or listen to.

**Translation:**

As already mentioned earlier, some videos are produced in languages other than the ones we understand. Subtitles help to understand what is being said in the video irrespective of the language in which it was originally produced.

**Low-quality speakers:**

Watching a video with low quality or faulty speakers can be a bit frustrating without subtitles.

**Watching videos in a noisy environment:**

We have all been in places that are noisy and we have had the need to watch a video or listen to an audio file. Subtitles come in handy at this point. They are also useful when we do not want to distract others while watching a video.

**Learn foreign languages:**

Subtitles are a very good way to learn new languages, sometimes consciously, other times it happens with any conscious effort. While watching a movie discovered ‘_Lo Siento'_ means I’m sorry in Spanish while ‘_Arigatou_’ means ‘thank you in Japanese.

**Reading speed:**

If you want to improve your reading speed, subtitles equally help you do that.

## 4\. Subtitle Tips and Tricks

Subtitle software applications let you add captions to videos, edit them, translate them to languages of your choice, etc. Let us look at a few of them below:

**Subtitle Edit:**

Subtitle Edit is largely free software that allows users to create timecoded subtitles. Users can also import and convert subtitles from one format to another format. If you’re new to subtitling, this is a good place to start before moving up to other advanced software applications.

**Annotation Edit:**

Annotation Edit is another application but it is specific to mac users. It has a very good user-friendly interface which makes it easy software to use.

Other software applications are equally very useful in subtitling.

When creating subtitles, ensure they are automated so as not to make it difficult to read when certain colors are displayed on the screen. Timing is very important. Make sure the subtitle is properly synchronized with the actual sound being produced.

Use a user-friendly font style. Each font style is unique for each viewing and it speaks volumes of what the video has to say or the message it wants to pass. So, it is expedient to learn more about font style, font color, font size etc. for a better-subtitled video.

## The Bottom Line

Subtitled videos are more likely to be used than videos without subtitles. So as a content creator, entrepreneur or in any field where you work with videos, adding a subtitle to your videos could be the turning point even for your organization for a wider audience.

## Part 5: Bonus! Use Filmora – Easy to Use Video Editor for Color LUTs

Besides Final Cut Pro and PowerDirector, Filmora is another excellent video editing software that you can use to apply LUTs to your video.

Designed for beginners and intermediate users, Filmora is an intuitive yet powerful video editing software.

For instance, you can apply 3D LUTs to your video using Filmora. Unlike 1D LUTs, which can only control one value setting, 3D LUTs can allow you to control various value settings. As a result, 3D LUTs can give you more control over specific color values in your video.

Here’s how you can apply LUTs using Filmora:

### Step 1\.  Import the Footage

Launch Filmora and choose New Project. In the New Project window that opens, import the video you want to apply the LUT to by clicking on Import and selecting one of the drop-down options.

### Step 2\.  Add the Video to the Timeline

Drag and drop the video into your project’s timeline.

### Step 3\.  Open the Color Tab

Double click the video on the timeline to select it. Once it’s selected, go to the top left panel and click on the color tab.

![use lut in filmora - open color tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-5.jpg)

### Step 4\. Apply a LUT to the Video

Under the color tab, navigate to the 3D LUT option and select one of the available options in the 3D LUT drop-down menu to apply a LUT.

Many LUTs are named after popular TV shows and series whose visual styles they mimic, such as Batman, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more.

Once you apply a LUT, you can see your changes in the Preview Window. Besides using the preset LUTs, Filmora also allows you to use custom LUTs. Instead of choosing one of the presets, click on the Load New LUT option to import your custom LUT into Filmora.

### Step 5\. Make Fine Adjustments

Once you apply a LUT, Filmora can allow you to make further modifications to the video. Click on the Advanced button at the bottom of the color tab to view advanced color correction options.

In the new window that opens, you can adjust several things, such as color, light, HSL, and more. You can also choose from a variety of other available presets.

![use lut in filmora - make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-6.jpg)

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

Color grading can be a tedious process, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to achieve the desired result. That’s where a LUT can come in handy. So, what is a LUT?

LUT stands for “look up table.” Simply put, a LUT is a color preset that you can apply to your video footage to speed up the color grading process. While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.

Designed for beginners and intermediate users, Filmora is an intuitive yet powerful video editing software.

For instance, you can apply 3D LUTs to your video using Filmora. Unlike 1D LUTs, which can only control one value setting, 3D LUTs can allow you to control various value settings. As a result, 3D LUTs can give you more control over specific color values in your video.

Here’s how you can apply LUTs using Filmora:

### Step 1\.  Import the Footage

Launch Filmora and choose New Project. In the New Project window that opens, import the video you want to apply the LUT to by clicking on Import and selecting one of the drop-down options.

### Step 2\.  Add the Video to the Timeline

Drag and drop the video into your project’s timeline.

### Step 3\.  Open the Color Tab

Double click the video on the timeline to select it. Once it’s selected, go to the top left panel and click on the color tab.

![use lut in filmora - open color tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-5.jpg)

### Step 4\. Apply a LUT to the Video

Under the color tab, navigate to the 3D LUT option and select one of the available options in the 3D LUT drop-down menu to apply a LUT.

Many LUTs are named after popular TV shows and series whose visual styles they mimic, such as Batman, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more.

Once you apply a LUT, you can see your changes in the Preview Window. Besides using the preset LUTs, Filmora also allows you to use custom LUTs. Instead of choosing one of the presets, click on the Load New LUT option to import your custom LUT into Filmora.

### Step 5\. Make Fine Adjustments

Once you apply a LUT, Filmora can allow you to make further modifications to the video. Click on the Advanced button at the bottom of the color tab to view advanced color correction options.

In the new window that opens, you can adjust several things, such as color, light, HSL, and more. You can also choose from a variety of other available presets.

![use lut in filmora - make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-6.jpg)

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

02 [Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

**Step 2: Color Selection**

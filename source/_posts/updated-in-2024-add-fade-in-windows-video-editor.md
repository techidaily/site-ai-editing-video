## How To Add Fade In Windows Video Editor

A recent development in the media business is the fading into and out of videos, which significantly improves and cools down a scene. It causes the movie to twist and gives it a photorealistic appearance, giving the sense of depth. Too much or too little fading might ruin the whole impact of the video that has been generated, which is why we're providing instructions on how to apply fade in Windows video editors.

People often search for How to Add Fade in after effects but in such tools, backgrounds are used to achieve fading, so what should you do if you want your movie on your Windows 10 desktop to fade to black, white, or another color? We suggest the solution in this article that would be of assistance. It is suggested that you apply the video fades using a backdrop clip which is either black or white. Video fades come in two varieties: fade in and fade out. A video or picture may gradually appear from a black, white, or colored backdrop using a technique called a "fade-in." On the other hand, a video or picture may gradually blend into a white, black, or multicolored backdrop using the fade-out technique.

## Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor

To begin with, you'll need top-notch editing software for your movies. We advise you to try Windows Video Editor if you use Windows. It is slick, simple, and enjoyable to use. The Microsoft Store's most downloaded video editing app is also this one. To test how it works, you may install it for free. The Windows video editor is a strong tool that makes it simple for users to utilize the fundamentals of video editing. It has the ability to move, concatenate, cut, and add the Fading effects to videos. However, it lacks the transitions needed to insert them into videos or in between them.

**Steps to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor**

The built-in windows tool does not have any option of 'transition'.

In case of Filmora, and other such tools, there is a straight up option for transitions where you can fade in and out with a lot of other cool stuff. For fading you can follow the method mentioned above in the article.

You can take the first of the two clips and lower its sound and in the next clip, you can mute the clip, note: the clips must be kept small, otherwise it will sound quite weird. If the respective lengths of the clips are kept quite small, only then will the fade feel natural. Due to unavailability of a direct command, fading the music out can be a very taxing job.

##### Step3 Add the Number to Your Countdown

Now, add the numbers for the countdown, e.g., if you want a 10-second countdown, type in the number "10". You can pick a basic text effect and manually enter the number.

After you've created the number, go to the timeline and control how long the number will appear and when it will disappear.

##### Step4 Add Music or Sound Effects to Your Countdown Video

FlexClip lets you upload your audio files from a local folder, or you can select one from FlexClip's library. Once you're done adding the countdown music, you can trim the duration, set it to start and end at any time, and use the fade-in/out effect to make the music match your countdown. Plus, you can also adjust the volume to make the music softer.

### Method 3: Make a Countdown Timer with a Graphic Design Platform

Today’s graphic design platforms give designers more options than ever before, but many designers struggle to make the most of these resources. Let us share some tips and tricks on designing a countdown timer using the tools available through Canva, a graphic design platform.

#### **Canva**

![canva web interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-11.png)

Many types of graphic design software are available, and Canva is one of the best. While its critics may disagree, Canva is an undeniable tool to help millions of business owners and marketers improve their social media graphics and redesign their brand image without needing to learn graphic design.

**Key Features:**

* Drag and drop feature
* Free templates
* Background Removal Tool
* Canva Brand Kit
* Magic Resizing

**How to make a countdown animation with Canva**

Canva offers a range of great-looking countdown templates that'll help you create one in just a few minutes. And if you need a simple countdown animation, you can download one of their free templates. Let's make it from scratch:

##### Step1 Select The Background

With Canva, you get a wide range of free backgrounds. Click on the button labeled "Search." Now choose the "light old film" background element and click Add.

![select background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-12.png)

##### Step2 Enter Your Text (Number)

Then select the text tab and choose any font style, color, and size.

![enter your number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-13.png)

##### Step3 Animate Text

Next, select the font again, and then, at the top, there's an option for Text Animation.

Adding text animation to your countdown timer will make it more realistic and match your background better than a straight-up countdown timer.

![animate text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-14.png)

##### Step4 Edit The Page Timing

Next, click on the “Edit Timing” option. You can set the timer for each page as per your choice

![edit page timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-15.png)

##### Step5 Duplicate The Page

Now, select the duplicate page option and change the number of duplicate pages from 3 to 2,1, with the same design and formatting.

![duplicate the page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-16.png)

##### Step6 Export / Download Video

You're finally done! Click the Download button to export your design.

The background of this photo is not a static image, so you cannot select the JPG, PNG, or SVG. You must choose an MP4 video or a GIF when creating an animation.

By 1980, VHS had captured 70% of the market and had established itself as the industry standard for entertainment and instruction.

The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.

## What Is VHS?

Since its introduction in 1976, VHS has been the most frequently used video cassette recording technology. The VHS format is a consumer-level analog video cassette recording standard for videotaping. The acronym VHS referred to Vertical Helical Scan and was eventually modified as the popularity of this technology increased.

Produced by a Japan Victor Company, the technology uses a magnetic tape measuring half an inch. By the 1950s, magnetic tape video recording had become a vital part of the television industry. The technology is exclusively utilized in professional settings like TV studios and medical imaging (fluoroscopy).

As consumer access to videotape increased in the 1970s, a new economy centered on home video emerged, drastically altering the economics of the film and television industries. By 1980, VHS had captured 70% of the market and had established itself as the industry standard for entertainment and instruction.

The original standard has a picture quality equivalent to that of analog television. High-definition television content could be recorded and re-created using digital VHS (D-VHS). Progressively, a new format was launched dubbed S-VHS (Super VHS), which featured improved video quality from 240 to 400 lines; however, people did not use it extensively.

VHS tape, compared to its competition at the time, Betamax tapes had longer tape lifespans. VHS tapes were preferred because they recorded three times as long as Betamax tapes because of their higher storage capacity.

The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.

## Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?

For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

![ar in teaching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-1.jpg)

If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home/office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating **Augmented Reality in classrooms** and the education sector.

## Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education

### 01No Special Equipment Required

One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.

### 02Better Student Engagement

Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.

### 03Practical Learning

Another major advantage of **Augmented Reality in teaching** is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.

### 04Combined Learning

Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With **Augmented Reality in schools,** students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.

### 05Affordable

Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.

## Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples

Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, **AR classrooms** have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality in classrooms**.

### 01Exploring the Universe With Skyview

Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?

### 04Froggipedia

This is where things get interesting. Froggipedia is a great example of **Augmented Reality in teaching**. It’s basically a smartphone app that lets users explore the internal organs of a frog in a virtual environment. It means students would no longer have to get involved in the mess that dissecting an actual frog creates in the classroom and still get familiar with each organ easily.

![froggipedia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-4.jpg)

### 05Effective Marketing

Another example of **Augmented Reality in the teaching** world has nothing to do with learning, but the marketing aspect of the industry. With AR-based platforms, universities and colleges can market their brands among the target consumers and get a higher number of applications in return. They can launch digital publications and AR-powered videos to maximize engagement and achieve the desired results through their marketing campaigns.

![effecting marketing with ar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-5.jpg)

### 06Virtual Classrooms

The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of virtual classrooms as many schools still haven’t resumed physical classes to restrict the virus's spread. In VR classrooms, mixed reality - a combination of VR and AR - can help students stay engaged, even if they are sitting apart from each other. Virtual Classrooms will eliminate boredom from remote learning and keep the engagement level high for students.

![virtual classrooms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-6.jpg)

### 07Secure Training

As we mentioned earlier, AR integration makes training more effective and risk-free. For example, with Microsoft Holo-lens, medical students understand the inner anatomy of the human body and understand complex procedures without having to risk a patient’s life. Once they are confident and know about each organ, they can move towards the next procedure and gain expertise in the particular domain more effectively.

### 08Google Expeditions

For a student, exploring the world is a great way to familiarize himself with different cultures. But, it’s not always possible for young kids to go on trips alone. Well, not anymore! Thanks to virtual tour platforms like Google Expeditions, teachers can take their students on virtual trips to different corners of the world, be it Mount Everest Base Camp or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

![google expeditions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-7.jpg)

### 09Augmented Reality in Museums

The younger generation craves interactivity. They don’t have the time to read brochures in a Museum. That’s the reason why many Museums have started to launch AR-powered tech to keep the visitors engaged and let them learn various historical facts more precisely. For instance, in a nature-themed museum, visitors can experience digital animals and their position in history.

### 10Virtual Speech

Not particularly an Augmented Reality (AR) example, Virtual Speech is a combination of AR and VR that lets users virtually practice their public speaking skills without going on a real stage. This is a great tool to fight stage fear and speak with confidence in front of an actual crowd.

![virtual speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-8.jpg)

## Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?

For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

![ar in teaching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-1.jpg)

If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home/office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating **Augmented Reality in classrooms** and the education sector.

## Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education

### 01No Special Equipment Required

One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.

### 02Better Student Engagement

Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.

### 03Practical Learning

Another major advantage of **Augmented Reality in teaching** is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.

### 04Combined Learning

Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With **Augmented Reality in schools,** students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.

### 05Affordable

Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.

## Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples

Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, **AR classrooms** have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality in classrooms**.

### 01Exploring the Universe With Skyview

Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?

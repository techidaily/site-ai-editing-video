## Part 1: Backup Your Original Video

Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup. Making this a habit will save you a lot of time and work in the long term. How many copies of your data should you make? You should create at least three project duplicates in the best-case scenario. Also, make sure they're preserved in various formats and places—one on an SD card, another on a hard drive, or a USB drive.

## Part 1: Backup Your Original Video

Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup. Making this a habit will save you a lot of time and work in the long term. How many copies of your data should you make? You should create at least three project duplicates in the best-case scenario. Also, make sure they're preserved in various formats and places—one on an SD card, another on a hard drive, or a USB drive.

## Part 5: How to Split Video with Filmora

##### Step1Import your videos to Filmora Video Cutter

Launch the video cutter once it has been installed and click New Project to access the video editing interface. Now you must import the video, which must be divided into numerous portions.

![Upload files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fig-1.jpg)

Upload files

You can either drag and drop files to the media library before adding them to the timeline for editing, or you can click "Import" on the main interface and choose files from your computer.

VOB, 3GP, 3G2, MP4, FLV, AVI, MOV, F4V, M4V, TRP, M2TS, MTS, TP, DAT, WMV, MPG, MPEG, TS, MKV, ASF, DV, EVO, MOD, NSV, and TOD files are all supported by Filmora video cutter.

If your video contains a lot of distinct sequences, Filmora can help you discover the clip you want to trim. The "Scene Detection" tool will assist you in rapidly locating the part you wish to clip. To open the Scene Detection window, choose the video in the media library (not the timeline), right-click it, and select "Scene Detection."

![Detect video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fig-2.jpg)

Detect video

When you click Detect, Filmora will automatically split your films into multiple segments depending on scene changes.

Scenes detected automatically

By clicking the Delete symbol next to the clip, you may delete the undesired sequences and quickly get to the section you want. When you click the Add to Timeline button, all of the segmented video sections will be instantly imported into the timeline, which you can then modify.

##### Step2Manually trim/split/cut/delete videos

To trim video files, drag clips from the media library to the video track on the timeline and follow these steps. You may use the trim option to chop off the beginning or conclusion of a video swiftly.

* ii.You may edit a movie into portions, eliminate unnecessary aspects, and combine them into a new film, in addition to chopping off segments at the beginning or conclusion.
* iii.Move the play head to the beginning of the video part you want to cut, then click the Split icon (scissor icon) on the toolbar or the Split button on the play head to split the video. You will get the starting frame, then move the play head to the ending frame and click the Split button again to get the ending part.
* iv.To cut a video into many sections, repeat the procedure. You will get multiple clipped portions, which you may either remove or re-order and alter further.
* v.You may edit out an undesirable cut video by hitting the Delete symbol on the toolbar.

##### Step3Export your video

Click the Export button on the screen after you've completed cutting and basic editing. By choosing "Format" and specifying the essential options such as frame rate and resolution, you may save the video in different formats on your local computer.

If you wish to see your video production on your iPod, iPhone, or iPad, go to "Device" and choose your device's thumbnail. You may also instantly post your films on YouTube or Vimeo, or burn them to DVDs for long-term storage.

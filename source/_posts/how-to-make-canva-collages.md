If you are a Mac user, QuickTime Player is where you play and watch videos. QuickTime by Apple comes pre-installed on every Mac. It happens to be the default video player for macOS users. Under normal circumstances, QuickTime plays a video only once. However, there are times when you want to watch a video repeatedly in a loop.

When you have a short video clip, it is usual that you want to watch it in a loop. The same is applicable to music videos.

Quicktime Player is an Apple Inc. software that is compatible with all current versions of macOS X as well as Windows.

The user interface of the Quicktime media player is straightforward to navigate. The majority of video formats may be supported, as well. Like VLC, you can quickly speed up or slow down videos with Quicktime player using specific hotkeys or by manually altering the speed of the video.

![Man using quicktime player on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-change-quicktime-player-speed-on-mac.png)

A broad number of formats may be handled by QuickTime, including music, graphics, and panoramic photography. All of your music and video files will play without a hitch, and it is a fully complete media player.

The option to increase the Quicktime player speed is one of these hidden features' which is most popular and helpful. This is particularly true if you have to sit through a presentation or lecture.

## How to Speed up Videos in Quicktime Player?

If you want to watch your movies on Quicktime player as quickly as possible, go with a long-term solution. The pace of the clip may be raised or lowered from the toolbar, and the settings of the application can be altered.

![Control Speed on your computer using Quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-change-quicktime-player-speed-on-mac.png)

There are two ways to achieve this goal, one is manually through settings whereas the second way is using hotkeys. Let’s discuss both by understanding how to increase QuickTime player speed manually.

### Manually Setting Up Quicktime player speed

* Embedding video within the interface is recommended.
* Go to the Toolbar and choose the Windows tab from the drop-down menu.
* To access the A/V controls, press the A/V Controls button. There will be a dialogue box that appears.

* Close the box and go to watch the video in its entirety.

### Speeding Up playback Speed Quicktime Using Hotkeys

* There isn't a special hotkey for Quicktime that allows you to speed up or slow down the video. Using your mouse and keyboard, on the other hand, you may do the task in an instant.
* Open the video in the Quicktime Player on your computer by clicking on it.
* Play the video clip, and then hit the “OPTIONS” key on your keyboard to stop it.
* Press the Fast Forward button on the player and the left mouse button at the same time. It will speed up the pace at which the video is played back.

* Increasing the speed is accomplished by repeatedly clicking until the desired speed is achieved.

* However, keep in mind that there has been a glitch that has existed for years that causes the audio to stop working after you reach 2x speed. To get around this problem, just accelerate to 1.9x and then stop.

* If you come across anything you like and want to view it again, you may stop the video by pressing the space bar twice. However, pressing the spacebar will cause the playing speed to be reset.

## How to Slow Down Videos in Quicktime Player?

When viewing a movie on your Mac, you may discover that you need to slow it down on a frequent basis. You may discover a range of slow down video editing tools that can help you slow down a video on the internet. Furthermore, various video players may be able to let you quickly slow down your movie.

We sometimes overlook the enormous capacity inherent inside the dependable and dependable QuickTime Player. QuickTime contains a number of key capabilities meant to help you deal with your media files and play video and audio files.

### Steps to follow to slow down Quicktime Player speed

#### Manual Setup

## What If Quicktime Player Speed up With No Sound?

No sound may be heard when the video is played back if it was encoded in a format that QuickTime cannot understand. Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.

### Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.

## How to Play Videos at 2X Speed with Sound in Quicktime?

Follow the below-mentioned steps to play video at 2x speed with sound in Quicktime:

* Launch QuickTime.
* Click on Edit, which is located on the toolbar on the top. A drop-down menu will appear.
* From the drop-down menu, click on QuickTime Preferences.
* Then select Audio from the dialogue box.
* Then moving forward, change the music synthesizer to Promethean Audio Device, Promethean USB Audio or USB Audio Device. These options might vary depending on the user's specific hardware.
* Click on Apply and then OK.

### Unique and Distinct Features of Filmora

Software is not nearly as good if it does not have the appropriate set of functionalities, and most users will not bother to use it if it does not include these features. Listed here are the most eagerly anticipated features of Filmora's latest version:

#### Motion Tracking

The Motion Tracking module enables you to identify an object or point inside a video and then have the computer track that object or point to generate a moving path.

It allows you to capture the motion of a moving object in the frame and add text, subtitles, effects, and other components to the frame that follow the moving object's motion as it moves around the screen.

#### Colour Matching Feature

This team has always considered that Filmora's colour grading and correction tools were excellent, but their most recent addition to the 'Color Matching' program has garnered them even more praise.

Colour matching is crucial when trying to merge several video images obtained by two different cameras. In this semi-automated module, you may match video from multiple sources or footage acquired at different times of day with one another.

#### Keyframing Feature

Keyframing is an essential feature for users who wish to boost the appeal of their video by incorporating critical animation sequences throughout the film.

It enables you to create custom animations and have fine-grained control over the effects you apply to your projects via the use of keyframes.

Keyframing becomes critical when creating special effects, custom title cards at the beginning or middle of a film or conjuring precise paths for visuals or picture-in-picture movies to follow.

#### Audio Ducking

Audio ducking is a method used in video editing and production that allows the narrator's voice to be heard consistently and clearly over other sounds on the recording that are happening at the same time, such as background music, without being dominated.

#### Transitions and Vast Amount of Effects

Over 300 special effects, objects, overlays, transitions, and music and audio effects are available whenever and wherever you need them. The bundle includes 25 sound effects and 26 royalty-free recordings, making it a complete package.

Then there are 176 transitions, each of which may be customized to liven up your project. You may also alter and manipulate visuals and text to make your project more aesthetically appealing.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file.

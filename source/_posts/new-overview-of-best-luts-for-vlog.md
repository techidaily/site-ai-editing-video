02 [How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate](#Part 2)

## Part 1 How Animation Works in Procreate

GIFs are known to be the top ranked and most intuitive trendsetters in the world of infotainment and media service tools. Be it for fun or a targeted market influence, you can depend on GIFs for a variety of information solutions. Moving to the creative aspect, the experimentation belt with creating GIFs is huge. From making simple static and animated GIFs to creating professionally sound market promotion tools; you can play with your editing skills to extract just anything from these quick snippets.

Having said that, let’s take a dive into creating animated **Procreate GIFs**. Being a relatively new dimension of GIF editing, a merge of the two produces matchless and classic results. Read through the further article to get a complete guide for working on GIF creation and editing with Procreate.

**●** **Underlying Concept**

Before you begin creating a **Procreate GIF**, let’s get a bit familiar with the concept behind this GIF creation utility. This one is an excellent and advanced means of exploring your skills in digital drawing and animations. It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.

Procreate allows you to work with animation in its ‘Animation Assist’ tool, where you get a generous workspace with the perfect editing canvas to experiment with a plethora of tools, effects and filters to create exciting GIFs with basic and complex animation craft.

The software allows frame-by-frame animation that refers to working with different frames of a particular illustration, while making minimal changes in each frame. Once you finish, your final creation gets played in a motion loop.

## Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate

As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:

**●** **Step 1: Select an Artwork**

Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.

If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.

![Procreate Animated GIF Creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-1.JPG)

**●** **Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool**

From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.

![Procreate- Animation Assist Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-2.JPG)

**●** **Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments**

At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.

While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.

**●** **Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.**

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

**Step 5: Almost There.**

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.

Procreate is undoubtedly an excellent tool for creating animated GIFs, but if you are looking for alternatives, another software to rely on is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** GIF creator.

As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:

**●** **Step 1: Select an Artwork**

Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.

If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.

**●** **Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool**

From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.

![Procreate- Animation Assist Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-2.JPG)

**●** **Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments**

At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.

While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.

**●** **Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.**

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

**Step 5: Almost There.**

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.

It is no secret that videos are a powerful marketing tool. In fact, studies have shown that including video on a landing page can increase conversion rates by up to 80%.

![Powerful Marketing Tool ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-create-video-contents-that-convert-sales-01.jpg)

Powerful Marketing Tool

Sales videos are all about encouraging potential customers to buy a product or service. They usually include persuasive tactics, such as an authoritative voice, logical arguments, and emotional appeals. By effectively communicating the benefits of a product or service, sales videos can be highly effective in influencing someone to make a purchase.

![Sales videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-create-video-contents-that-convert-sales-02.jpg)

Sales videos

A sales video is a powerful tool that can help you to generate sales leads and close more deals. By providing potential customers with an overview of your products or services, you can give them the information they need to make an informed purchase decision. In addition, a sales video can help to build trust and credibility with your audience. By featuring testimonials from satisfied customers, you can show potential buyers that your products or services deliver on their promises.

Moreover, a sales video can be an excellent way to showcase your company's unique strengths and capabilities. By highlighting your company's unique selling points, you can give potential customers a good reason to choose your business over the competition. When used effectively, a sales video can be a powerful tool for generating new sales and increasing your bottom line.

But maybe you are wondering what's the key to creating videos that actually generate sales?

Key to Creating Videos

###### 1\. Understand Audience

The first thing that you need to do when creating a sales video is to understand your audience. Who are they? What do they want? What are their problems?

Once you know who your target audience is, it'll be a lot easier to create a video that will appeal to them and sell your product or service.

###### 2\. Explain What It is and How It Works

Now, let's say that you're selling a new type of product or service. In this case, it's best to create a video that introduces your product or service and explains what it is and how it works.

###### 3\. Case Studies

You can also use case studies or testimonials from happy customers to help boost the credibility of your product or service and convince potential buyers that it's worth investing in.

###### 4\. Create Video Content

Once you know who your target audience are, then it’s time for you to create a video content

![Target Audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-create-video-contents-that-convert-sales-03.jpg)

Target Audience

## 1\. Start with a Strong Hook

A strong hook is the key to creating a video that converts into sales. You have to make sure that your video is engaging and informative, while also offering something that viewers can't find elsewhere. A good hook will grab attention and keep viewers engaged throughout the entire video. There are a few different things you can do to create a strong hook for your video such as:

![Strong Hook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-create-video-contents-that-convert-sales-04.jpg)

Strong Hook

* Attention-grabbing headline. This should be something that makes viewers want to learn more.
* Give a brief overview of what they can expect from the video.
* Targeting the most common pain of your audience.

![Attention-Grabbing Headline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-create-video-contents-that-convert-sales-05.jpg)

Attention-Grabbing Headline

You only have a few seconds to make a strong impression. Use a strong wisely and you'll soon see your sales start to climb.

## 2\. Keep It Short And Sweet

In a fast-paced world, it can be tempting to try and pack as much information into a video as possible. However, when it comes to creating a video that converts into sales, less is definitely more.

## How To Add Fade In Windows Video Editor

A recent development in the media business is the fading into and out of videos, which significantly improves and cools down a scene. It causes the movie to twist and gives it a photorealistic appearance, giving the sense of depth. Too much or too little fading might ruin the whole impact of the video that has been generated, which is why we're providing instructions on how to apply fade in Windows video editors.

People often search for How to Add Fade in after effects but in such tools, backgrounds are used to achieve fading, so what should you do if you want your movie on your Windows 10 desktop to fade to black, white, or another color? We suggest the solution in this article that would be of assistance. It is suggested that you apply the video fades using a backdrop clip which is either black or white. Video fades come in two varieties: fade in and fade out. A video or picture may gradually appear from a black, white, or colored backdrop using a technique called a "fade-in." On the other hand, a video or picture may gradually blend into a white, black, or multicolored backdrop using the fade-out technique.

## Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor

To begin with, you'll need top-notch editing software for your movies. We advise you to try Windows Video Editor if you use Windows. It is slick, simple, and enjoyable to use. The Microsoft Store's most downloaded video editing app is also this one. To test how it works, you may install it for free. The Windows video editor is a strong tool that makes it simple for users to utilize the fundamentals of video editing. It has the ability to move, concatenate, cut, and add the Fading effects to videos. However, it lacks the transitions needed to insert them into videos or in between them.

**Steps to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor**

Step1Open Windows Video Editor and choose the video clip you wish to apply a fade to.

![choose video windows video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-video-windows-video-editor.jpg)

Step2To display further effects, click the down arrow in the corner of the effects tray after selecting the Visual Effects tab. The effects are divided into a group named Motions and Fades. To get an explanation and a sample of what the effects do, hover your mouse cursor over the thumbnails of the effects.

![click video tools windows editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-video-tools-windows-editor.jpg)

The available effects include pixelate, ripple, and a simple fade in or fade out to black or white. Apply No Effect, the first thumbnail in the list of visual effects, after choosing the clip and the visual effect you wish to remove.

Step3Select the desired video portion, then click the Edit tab under Video Tools to fade the video sound. The ribbon's initial part is devoted to audio controls. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.

## Part 3: FAQs Regarding Video Fade

### 1\. What is the fade panel in Windows video editor?

In the windows video editor, there is a panel for basic video editing tools. But for fading in/out of a video or text, there is no option available. The built-in windows tool does not have any option of 'transition'. It straight forwardly moves from one video clip to the other without any sort of transition because Microsoft believe these transitions to be lame and unnecessary. Hence, they are not available. In case of Filmora, and other such tools, there is a straight up option for transitions where you can fade in and out with a lot of other cool stuff. For fading you can follow the method mentioned above in the article.

### 2\. How do I fade text in Windows video editor?

As stated earlier, there is no option for fading in windows video editor, hence, even the text cannot be faded in or out. There is a panel for basic video editing tools in the Windows video editor. However, there is no ability for a video or text to fade in and out. There is no "transition" option in the built-in Windows programme. Microsoft considers these transitions to be unnecessary, so it simply switches from one video clip to the next without making any other effects.

### 3\. How do I fade out music in Windows video editor?

There is no direct command for making the music or sound fade out but you can do it manually, that is, in the video where ever you want the music or sound to fade out is that you can trim that clip out and then divide into two more clips. You can take the first of the two clips and lower its sound and in the next clip, you can mute the clip, note: the clips must be kept small, otherwise it will sound quite weird. If the respective lengths of the clips are kept quite small, only then will the fade feel natural. Due to unavailability of a direct command, fading the music out can be a very taxing job.

### The Bottom Line

The built-in video editor for Windows does not have a direct option, therefore fading procedures cannot be utilized without downloading and installing other software, such as Filmora, which may assist with such problems. Filmora comes with built-in tools for text, video, and audio fading. In Filmora, there are at least four different ways to fade media. As a consequence, the conclusion we reach is that although the Windows video editor is strong and useful in a professional setting, it cannot be utilized to create effects that are often employed in the current world to draw in viewers.

You can take the first of the two clips and lower its sound and in the next clip, you can mute the clip, note: the clips must be kept small, otherwise it will sound quite weird. If the respective lengths of the clips are kept quite small, only then will the fade feel natural. Due to unavailability of a direct command, fading the music out can be a very taxing job.

### The Bottom Line

The built-in video editor for Windows does not have a direct option, therefore fading procedures cannot be utilized without downloading and installing other software, such as Filmora, which may assist with such problems. Filmora comes with built-in tools for text, video, and audio fading. In Filmora, there are at least four different ways to fade media. As a consequence, the conclusion we reach is that although the Windows video editor is strong and useful in a professional setting, it cannot be utilized to create effects that are often employed in the current world to draw in viewers.

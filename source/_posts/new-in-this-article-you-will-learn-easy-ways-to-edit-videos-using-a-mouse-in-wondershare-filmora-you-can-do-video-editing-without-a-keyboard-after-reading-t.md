![buying wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-2.gif)

## Create a Music Video Without a Keyboard

Let us get started! Whether you have a real mouseless experience or want to take it as a challenge, let's get the things clear first.

* We need to create a **20 seconds** music video.
* We will only be using the footage from the **stock library**.
* We will be using music from the **Wondershare** Filmora **library**.
* We will have 5 minutes to **review** the footage and the music available.
* And most importantly, we don’t have a **keyboard**.

Step 1\. Review your footage

Our first and most crucial step will be to use our imagination and creativity. So get those neurons firing, and let us go!

![reviewing the footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-3.gif)

* Head to the **stock media** folder on the bar mentioned above, the Wondershare Filmora.
* Or you can simply look towards the left window, where you will find the sample **videos tab.**
* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.
* Here you will find almost more than **20 videos.**
* So apart from using the actual recorded footage, we will work our way with what we have from **default**.
* For the music, we would be scrolling in the **stock audio library.**
* Click on the **audio tab** above and start **scrolling**.
* You will also find some categories in the **left window**.
* Choose the category of your choice and **listen** to the audio.

Do whatever suit you best. Keep in mind you only have 5 minutes.

Step 2\. Pick music for your clips

Suppose you have found audio that speaks your vibe. The next step would be to find a video that tallies that audio. Let us suppose we have audio that is of the hip-hop genre. Let that creativity shine now!

![drone shot of rooftops](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-4.gif)

If you like to add a more **classical vibe**, pick a classical song or audio from the audio library.

* After picking the song, move on to the sample videos tab and search for videos that match a **classic vibe.**
* Now random **close-up shots** of a piano, cinematic footage of a big **orchestra**, or simple landscapes with minimalistic movement while focusing on a single object, consider the example below.

![still shot of a bench](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-5.gif)

Now that a scenario is constructed, our next step is to arrange these clips in the Wondershare Filmora timeline.

Step 3\. Download the clips and audio

**You have 15 minutes to create the music video. Start the timer!** Once you have selected a sample video and audio that matches your scenario, you can **download** them from the bottom right icon on the thumbnail. Only if you still need to download them.

Step 4\. Insert the audio into the timeline

* The first step is to drag the audio to the **timeline**.
* Now play the **audio** from the start. If you can work with the audio as a whole, then it's perfect.

If you want your audio to **start** at a certain point. You have to follow the below-mentioned steps. It is as simple as that!

![splitting the audio on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-6.gif)

* **Add** your audio to the timeline.
* Then move the **timer** or the slider where you want your audio to start.
* **Right-click** on the audio file. Select split.
* Your audio file will split into two parts.
* Delete the prior file and drag the file ahead to the start of the timeline.

The next step is to add the videos to the timeline.

Step 5\. Add the video to the timeline

When you have your audio in the timeline, your next step is adding the video. After you have trimmed or split your audio to your wish, follow the below steps.

![adding sample videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-7.gif)

* **Click** and **drag** to drop the video clips where you want the video to start.
* **Play** the audio first is a good feature for where you want your video to insert.
* Then adjust the **timeline** slider on that point.
* Simply drag your video and drop it into the timeline.

## Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?

It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist's ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.

You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:

### 1\. Choose an image that you like

It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.

### 2\. Break the image down into single-color sections

This is the part where "careful planning" comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.

### 3\. Obtain the necessary resources

You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.

### 4\. Start building

Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece's complexity.

## Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art

There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.

* Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.
* Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you'll need to make your pixel art.
* Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.
* If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.

### Conclusion

Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.

Many of its key features are, for example, exporting images, dynamic size adjustment of the ability to save in several different formats. Its tools range from the regular pencil to eraser, paint bucket, line and circle drawer, move/zoom function, color wheel, and eyedropper.

## Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?

It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist's ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.

You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:

### 1\. Choose an image that you like

It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.

### 2\. Break the image down into single-color sections

This is the part where "careful planning" comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.

### 3\. Obtain the necessary resources

You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.

### 4\. Start building

Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece's complexity.

## Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art

There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.

* Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.
* Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you'll need to make your pixel art.
* Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.
* If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.

### Conclusion

Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.

## Part 1\. Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film

Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the **call of duty montage**.

In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.

Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie "Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual/metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).

### 3 Top Montages in Film for All Times

If the above two examples did not fully express **what is a montage video**, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.

**1\. Rocky (1976)**

One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer "Rocky". The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots' full training progression process.

To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character's passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.

**2\. Mulan (1998)**

Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.

Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character's struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX5zkYnGB0) to get an idea of how music and visuals can partner for tonal video montages.

**3\. Creed (2015)**

Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.

Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky's health deterioration against Creed's training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NH1A6CLIrY) to understand **what is a montage video** of the tonal type.

## Part 2\. Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media

Of course, movies and TV shows are the only types of media where video montage techniques are useful. Many non-professionals use options like a **fortnite montage editor** to create and edit montage videos for other projects they can share across platforms. Some even create video montages to create videos for social media.

These include vlog-like videos that people record and then edit together into a montage which different techniques. Plus, some users create montages of different things that interest them, like gameplay. Then, they share those videos across social media for views, like on TikTok or YouTube.

### · Gaming Montages

Different creators focus on developing **gaming montage**s to create projects for the games they operate. These can include videos showcasing the skills or gameplays of the creation, all explaining a specific theme in some cases.

### · Wedding Montages

Many users turn to edit video montages for specific occasions, adding clips of different moments instead of one long-running documentary. They incorporate stylish effects like slow motion and transitions, incorporate a moving background score, and more.

Many top influencers and celebrities have used this technique for their wedding videos on social media. Additionally, regular people also adopt the style.

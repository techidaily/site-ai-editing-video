Step 1

The first thing you want to do is download the [Filmora video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Hit Install and allow the application to start automatically.

Step 2

Once the program loads, head straight over to the **Titles** tab and drag the Basic Title to Track 3 on the Timeline.

Also, drag the clip from the right side towards the left to make it 4 seconds long.

Step 3

Double-click on the Title clip in the Timeline and edit your Title’s font and size. A panel like this one should pop up when you double-click. When you’re done, click **OK.**

![edit text in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-text-in-filmora.png)

Step 4

Now, take a snapshot of the new Title that you just created.

![make snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-snapshot-in-filmora.png)

Step 5

Next, we’re going to need a few more snapshots. But this time, double-click on the Title again and change its color to whichever one you like. Once you’ve changed its color, go ahead and click the same button as in Step 4 to take another snapshot.

![change text color in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-text-color-in-filmora.png)

Step 6

Next, double-click on the Title once again and go to **“ADVANCED”.** From there, go to **Add Shape** and select the **Rectangle** shape.

![add shape to text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-shape-to-text.png)

Step 7

Look to the left side panel and switch **OFF** the **Text Fill** button. Then, scroll down to the bottom and change the **Shape Fill** color to White.

![change shape fill color filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-shape-fill-color-filmora.png)

Step 8

Now, adjust the rectangle’s shape to a thin line, rotate it, and move it into position like in the image.

![adjust shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adjust-shape.png)

Step 9

Delete the text layer from the Advanced panel.

![delete text layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/delete-text-layer.png)

Step 10

The final step in the Advanced panel is to go to the **Animation** tab from the left side panel and select the **Round Zoom Out** animation preset. Then, click **OK.**

![round zoom out animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/round-zoom-out-animation.png)

Step 11

Now, it’s time to align the clips in the Timeline. First, move your Default Title clip 5 frames further. Then, drag the first snapshot to Track one and move it 8 frames forward.

![align clips in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/align-clips-in-filmora.png)

Step 12

Go to **Sample Color** and drag the Black color to Track 3 in the Timeline. Align it directly on top of where the clip in Track 1 starts. Then, double-click on the black color clip and align it like in the image here.

![align clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/align-clip.png)

Step 13

Now, place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip in Track 1\. Then, double-click the snapshot clip in Track 1\. Now, start increasing the value of the X-axis until it makes the text disappear, just as in this image here.

![edit snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-snapshot-in-filmora.png)

Step 14

Next, move the Playhead 10 frames further. Then, reset the position values by clicking on this button.

![reset position values](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reset-position-values.png)

Step 15

Now, move the Playhead once more and set it at 3 seconds and 10 frames. Then, click on the “+**Add”** button to add another keyframe.

![add keyframe in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-keyframe-in-filmora.png)

Step 16

Move the Playhead to the end of the snapshot clip and set the value of the X axis to 391\. Then, reduce the opacity to 0%. Move the Playhead at the start of the snapshot clip and reduce the opacity to 0% there as well.

![change opacity in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-opacity-in-filmora.png)

Step 17

Next, **Export** the clip to your PC. Just hit the Export button near the top-center of the screen. Then, select all of your clips in the Timeline and move them one track above. Then, drag the second snapshot you took earlier to Track 1.

![drag snapshot to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-snapshot-to-timeline.png)

Step 18

Select the Black Color clip once again and move the position of the Black box like this.

![move position of clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/move-position-of-clip.png)

Step 19

Now, hide the clip on Track 2 by pressing this button next to it.

![hide clip in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/hide-clip-in-filmora.png)

Step 20

Click on the second snapshot clip located in Track 1\. Then, repeat the process of adding keyframes just like we did with the first snapshot. Review the previous steps to get this right. This time, **remember** to slide the X axis to the **LEFT** instead of RIGHT. Just drag the values to the left.

Step 21

Export this. Then, delete all the clips in the Timeline. Now, import both clips you exported earlier during these steps. Also, import a background video that you’d like to appear behind your slide masking text effect.

Step 22

Next, drag the clips to Timeline and adjust each of them to be the same length. Four seconds is a good option.

Step 23

Double-click on the first clip (not the background clip). Go to **Video** and under **Blending Mode** select **Lighten.**

![blending mode filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/blending-mode-filmora.png)

Step 24

Drop your second clip to Track three and repeat the same edits for it.

Step 25

Set the Playhead on frame three and drop the **Motion Shape** element from the Elements tab on Track 4.

![motion shape element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/motion-shape-element.png)

Step 26

Finally, copy and paste the element near the end of the video and Render the project. Then, review your masterpiece. That’s it!

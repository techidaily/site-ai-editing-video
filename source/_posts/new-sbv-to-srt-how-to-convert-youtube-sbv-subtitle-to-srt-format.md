## Best Jump Cut Editing Tricks

The jump cut is more common than ever, from YouTube to movie montages. A jump cut is a method for transitioning from one shot to another without including any interstitial video. A jump cut is a cinematic technique when the editor abruptly cuts from one shot to another without any discernible transition.

When filmmakers wish to display someone's views or ideas without having to invest time and money in recording them, for example, this may be utilized for creative effects. Learn all there is to know about jump cuts in the next paragraphs, including their history, how to create one, how to edit one, and how to utilize one in your next social media video.

## Part 1: What is Jump Cut in Films?

To produce a smooth viewing experience, the director, editor, and cinematographer collaborate. Certain cuts have the power to startle a viewer out of this experience and remind them that they are watching a movie. The term "jump cut" refers to one of these cuts. Jump cuts are often discouraged in cinema, yet there are efficient methods to use them to provide the greatest narrative possible.

In video editing, a jump cut is the transition between two images of the same topic taken from the same or comparable angles and at two distinct times. This gives the impression that the action is 'jumping' ahead in time.

Most of the time, you want your videos' cuts to flow seamlessly. This offers continuity and a nice watching experience for your viewers. Although it's one of the most fundamental editing procedures, doing it correctly requires a bit more experience and ability. Let's thus try to make your jump cut technique even better.

## Part 2: 10 Most Shocking Jump Cuts in Film History

### 1\. City of God

With the combination of jump cuts, repetitive action, frantic montage, and a final bullet time graphic match wipe, the opening sequence of City of God drives the viewer into the pulse of the music and the violence in Rio. This seems like a prescription for catastrophe, yet it works in City of God. The screen is made electrified.

The chicken forces the characters to cross paths, which causes the two scenes to collide. Rezende now captures Rocket and Liz's expressions in slow motion, resulting in a dramatic scene. After a circular pan-centering Rocket, which melts into a different moment of ten years ago, the shot comes to a close.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/city-of-god.jpg)

#### 2\. The Ring

In the pivotal scenes of "The Ring," director Gore Verbinski used a jump cut to give the impression that Samara Morgan, the ghost, moves quickly around the room. By deleting or including anything in the frame, which is unsettling for both characters and viewers, this is a tried-and-true method of increasing the number of scares.

Jump cuts may also be distracting if done improperly or inappropriately, even though they are often intended to confuse or surprise the audience. There is a time and place for the method, even if a jump cut is far from the sole tool in the video editor's toolbox.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/the-ring.jpg)

#### 3\. Juno

In the movie Juno, director Jason Reitman portrays the tale of a young adolescent who becomes pregnant and ultimately gives her kid up. Each leap represents a new stage in the character's development as a result of this life-changing experience. Jump cuts in Jason Reitman's comedy-drama Juno depict the youthful heroine's journey both physically and mentally.

Jump cuts are a technique used by Reitman to convey both the passage of time and the changes in Juno's life. like visiting the adoptive parents or getting regular checks at the doctor. You might think of each jump cut as one of the five phases of grieving. In the last chapter, "summer," Juno has a better understanding of what she is giving up and how it will impact both her life and everyone else's.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/juno-jump-cuts.jpg)

#### 4\. Samara Kills Noah the Ring

It's a tremendously imaginative and horrifying conclusion after a whole film's worth of very subtle build-up that couldn't be farther from the really low expectations U.S. horror remakes often attract. Gerbinski cleverly arranges for Samara to "jump cut" in front of Noah while still flashing with TV static, shocking him and causing him to trip and fall.

It's fair to say that American horror films tend to rely on lazy jump scares, created by quick-cut images and loud sound effects, and that typically goes double for cynical state-side remakes of foreign language horror hits. However, Gore Verbinski's surprisingly stylish and moody 2002 remake of The Ring makes clever use of jump cuts during a crucial climactic scene to fully hammer home the terror of the film's spectral, black-haired antagonist Sam

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/samara-kills-noah-the-ring.jpg)

#### 5\. Dan’s Corpse – The Birds

Instead of using a single cut or even zooming on Dan's disfigured face, Hitch chooses to use two jump cuts that each bring us a little bit closer to Fawcett's face.

When seen now, it is a straightforward yet shocking effect, but in 1963, it was unquestionably genuinely horrifying. It was just one more of his many deliberate choices to depart from established cinematic norms. Although the jump cut is a simple editing method by today's standards, it was far less popular in earlier times, as seen by its skillful and startling use in Alfred Hitchcock's great 1963 horror film The Birds.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/dans-corpse.jpg)

#### 6\. Taking A Ride – Breathless

According to the Director Pierre Rissient, the jump cut technique was unplanned and developed out of a pressing necessity to trim Breathless from two and a half hours down to ninety minutes. The best example of this is when Patricia and Michel are driving about in their automobile, and Godard cuts between identical pictures of Patricia to show time passing while also heightening the urgency of the story of the couple on the run in the movie.

The significance of this sequence is that it dismantled rules for how a scene might be put together, despite the fact that it seemed absolutely primitive in retrospect. Not every movie that uses a jump cut in a dramatic or unexpected way must be in the horror category.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/take-a-ride-jump-cuts.jpg)

#### 7\. Charlie’s Head Hereditary

It's one of the strangest and really unsettling jump cuts we've seen in recent memory, and it definitely deserves the surprisingly intricate gore display that it has. One of the most eerie and masterfully orchestrated horror movies of the decade, if not the whole 21st century, is Ari Aster's Hereditary. Aster turns his attention to Peter, who is gazing out into the horizon, just as Annie can be heard screaming in agony, having found Charlie's corpse in the garage.

While Annie's screams can still be heard, the editor jump cuts from Peter's face to Charlie's severed, mangled head by the side of the road as it is being eaten by insects. After bringing his sister's headless corpse-filled automobile home, a terrified Peter parks it and gets into bed.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/charlies-head-hereditary.jpg)

#### 8\. Human Evolution in a Single Cut 2001: A Space Odyssey

This brief clip illustrates how man evolved from the monkey to the contemporary day, where we had been to space. In this brief sequence, which depicts the origins of modern man, new technology that has evolved over millions of years is dramatically upgraded.

The sequence includes a jump cut as the bone, a weapon of prehistoric man, travels through the air. Then, the picture jumps forward by nearly a million years, and the bone is replaced by a spacecraft with a like form.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/a-space-odyssey-jump-cuts.jpg)

#### 9\. Dr Erin Mears’s Death Contagion

In the masterpiece Contagion, the jump cut clustering that is seen experimentally is produced by the model. Afterward, leap intensities mean-revert until the next jump. But more crucially, Contagion vividly captures the danger of widespread fear, prejudice, and disinformation during a pandemic, particularly when it comes to social media and the internet.

In this shocking edit in film history, the editor made it all feasible by using a jump cut. Regardless of how realistic Contagion seems, it should still be seen as a work of fiction.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/dr-erin-mears-death-contagion.jpg)

#### 10\. The Jump Cut as a Special Effect the Haunted Castle

Whether a visual effect is created by hand or with a computer, selling it needs a community. The same is true for editing as well. In some cases, the visual impression is really the cuts. The modest cut is the most basic and traditional visual effect in movie magic. The method really dates back to early filmmakers and cinematic illusionists.

Amazed by the unexpected outcome, using a cut that has been deftly snuck into a whip-pan, two shots may be combined with full-scale sets and miniatures. A progressive makeup effect, such as the notorious metamorphosis in The Haunted Castle, may likewise be covered up using cuts.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/haunted-castle-jump-cuts.jpg)

## Part 3: How do We Use Jump Cuts Today?

The viewing experience is impacted differently by various editing methods. Jump cuts may be helpful for video editing in filmmaking since they highlight just the most important elements of a story while also indicating the passage of time. The jump cut is now often used in music videos, vlogs, and YouTuber material, making it a preferred option for creators of online content.

Today's movies often use "jump cuts," particularly as the number of horror movies produced has increased. The use of jump cuts makes the picture highly unsettling. One editing method, the jump cut, is still as effective now as it was back when pictures were stitched together and celluloid was cut with a razor blade. It is a well-liked method of video editing that is often used to indicate the passage of time, highlight an emotion, or heighten tension.

The shots did not quite run in a fluid session in the early phases of filming to provide the audience with a steady view of the screen. Instead, there were "jumps" in the movie, and the forward return was partially omitted. This "jump shot" idea may be compared to the expression. Today, however, despite all of the technological advancements we have at our disposal, movie makers and producers are attempting to recreate the look.

## Part 4: Top 9 Editing Tools to Smooth Over Jump Cuts

Jump from your lodge to the Subtropical Swimming Paradise to Archery to exploring the forest - the possibilities are endless - using the Jump Cut in social media videos, it's a unique way to capture all those experiences for you and your family to look back on later.

### Jump Cuts on TikTok

Jump cuts are quite simple to master and apply to almost all of the other transitions. After shooting your first clip, change the subject or the action in preparation for shooting your second clip. Try to keep the new action or subject in the same position. The magic will happen in the edit, when you combine the clips.

### Jump Cuts on Instagram

You will need a smartphone to film your jump cut and a tool to "edit" your video to help you put it all together. Once all your video clips are in order, the next step is to cut down each video to just your jumps. You need to crop the video as you land in the location and as you jump out. You will need to use Instagram to film your separate clips on your smartphone first, then put them together in Instagram Reels.

## Part 6: Creative Ways to Jump Cuts Like a Pro

Jump cuts can enhance your videos' quality, making them worthwhile to learn for any content creator who wants to use editing as a tool rather than a barrier.

### Way 1: Add shots and cutaways

When it comes to integrating jump cuts, think about immersing your audience in the story. Jump cuts are the opposite of continuity editing. instead of a seamless and immersive progression, we create something that feels less natural by chopping up a single clip. If you need even more convincing, keep in mind that boosting your content will also improve the experience of your viewers. And focusing on that will make them keep coming back to your videos for the foreseeable future.

### Way 2: Intentionally Using Jump Cuts

While this editing method does serve that purpose, a good jump cut is more of a stylistic choice, and stylistic choices are what make a film stronger as long as they are planned and integrated, rather than thrown together during editing. Of course, the added benefit is that you'll likely get some advice on other types of cuts you can use in your videos.

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

### 2\. How to Create APNG File?

**Step 1: Select Image**

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

**Step 2**: Choose Image Format

Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select "Change width and height" and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a \[width\]x\[height\] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.

### 1\. What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics)

The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG).

You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10's iMessage apps.

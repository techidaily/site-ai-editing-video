## Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?

Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.

**1\. History and Current Policies**

Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.

**2\. Accessibility**

Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.

**3\. Deletion**

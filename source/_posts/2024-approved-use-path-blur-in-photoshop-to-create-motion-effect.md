LUTs are like magic formulas that make your videos and images look better. They tweak the colors and tones in your footage to create a new visual experience. Following are the basic details of using and applying LUTs in basic video editing operations.

**Types of LUTs**

* **Technical LUTs:** These are for technical stuff like adjusting color spaces or correcting gamma. They ensure your colors and tones stay consistent across different devices and platforms.
* **Creative LUTs:** This type is a fun type of LUT. Creative LUTs help you achieve specific looks or styles. They can make your videos look like they were shot on film or create different moods and visual effects.

**Apply LUTs with the Correct LUT Format**

You can apply LUTs using different video editing software. For instance, there is Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, and others to apply LUT. Just load the LUT and apply it to your video clips or the whole project. Moreover, you can make adjustments to the LUT according to your preference.

## How to Create A Freeze Frame Sequence in Video

_Are you considering getting your video editing skills to a new high level? Are you worried about spicing your videos with stylish shots and bringing attention to particular aspects of your video?_

Freeze frame sequence is one the most stunning effects that can help you greatly. The freeze frame sequence has been used in many classic and present-day movies. And it will never go out of fashion.

Here, we will guide you on creating freeze frame sequences in your videos using Filmora. It is critical here to know what exactly the freeze frame sequence is. So let's jump right into it!

## Part 1\. What Is A Freeze Frame?

A freeze frame is a specific single frame of the video clip shown repeatedly in the video. It gives the illusion of a static picture. It is used to draw the viewers' attention to the minute details of a specific moment, to set up a powerful narrative, or to introduce your main characters.

![freeze frame effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-1.jpg)

Content creators can also use the freeze-frame effect on fast-moving objects to draw the viewers' attention. Have a few examples of the most popular freeze frames used in the movies.

### Examples of freeze frames in popular movies

Alfred Hitchcock used the first-ever freeze-frame in his film Champagne (1928). There is a long list of many famous tv shows and movies in which the freeze frame effect has been used since then. But to count a few, three examples are given here.

**1\. Pulp Fiction (1994)**

In the beginning scene of Pulp Fiction, where robbery is about to occur, a freeze-frame effect is used to engage the audience. Later in the movie, it was relieved what would happen next. It was a dramatic pause to draw attention. It is a strong example of the freeze-frame effect.

![pulp fiction's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-2.png)

**2\. The Breakfast Club (1985)**

The ending of Breakfast Club is an iconic example of the freeze-frame effect. With a powerful narration, the freeze frame conveys the movie's central idea to the audience.

![the breakfast club's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-3.png)

**3\. Suicide Squad (2016)**

In the trailer of Suicide Squad, freeze frames were used by the director to introduce the characters. This trailer used stylish animations to give relevant information about the film's main characters.

![suicide squad's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-4.png)

Having discussed the famous examples, let's learn about the power of freeze frames.

### The power of freeze frame

The old freeze frames give a retro vibe. However, with the advancement in editing technology, this special effect has proved that there is no end. Furthermore, it has shown that you can do many things with pauses.

Especially when you are a content creator, this effect empowers you by advertising your skills impressively. It also conveys your message convincingly.

Being a content creator, you always want to reach the maximum audience. This special effect will serve this too. It will ultimately get you more viewership, more likes, and more subscriptions. But how to create a freeze frame?

## Part 2\. How To Create Freeze Frame Sequence? \[Step-Wise Guide\]

Let's see how to add a freeze frame sequence in your video step-wise and get started.

##### Step1 Download Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare Filmora is an all-in-one video editing platform. It is enhanced with multiple practical media resources. You can head to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) official site to download or upgrade your Filmora.

##### Step2 Import your clips and add them to the timeline

Open Filmora and create a new project. Import your clip into the media library. Add your clips to the first video layer on the timeline.

![import your video clip and add it to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-6.png)

##### Step3 Apply color correction to the footage

Before we start our edit, let's color correct our footage, so the corrected color is already applied when we take the screenshots.

![apply color correction to your clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Find your first action frame

Next, scrub through the clip to find your first action frame. **For example,** in this video, this is our first action frame.

![select the first action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-8.png)

##### Step5 Take a screenshot of the action frame

Let's head to the camera icon under the preview screen and click the icon. It will take a screenshot of the current frame that the playhead is on the timeline.

![take a screenshot of the action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-9.gif)

Make sure to keep the playhead the same after you've taken the snapshot. You can find your screenshot in the media tab.

##### Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline

Let's drag your screenshot onto video layer 2 and align it on the right side of the playhead. Then extend the screenshot so it lasts as long as your central clip.

![extend the screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-10.png)

##### Step7 Apply masks to the screenshot

Now, double-click on the screenshot. It will open the "Video" menu, then go into the "Mask" menu. Choose a mask shape and edit it so that it only covers where your subject is in the screenshot. **For example,** we choose the **"**Circle" mask shape in this video.

![choose your mask shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-11.png)

If you need help seeing what you're masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.

![hide the main video layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-12.gif)

Move the playhead forward and clean up your "mask." Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.

![editing of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-13.png)

##### Step8 Hide the first screenshot

Let's layer a couple more action frames! First, hide the first screenshot so it doesn't appear in your new screenshot.

![hide the first screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-14.png)

##### Step9 Select your second action frame

## Part 1\. Ideas for Making an Outstanding Educational Teaching Video

Creating an educational video is not enough. There are a few elements that should be kept in mind. Your content should be good enough. Another thing that needs attention is your viewers' interest. Your educational video is of no use if it cannot sustain the audience's interest.

What could be done to improve your videos? How can someone create outstanding educational teaching videos? All your questions will be answered in this section of the article. We are going to share ideas for good educational videos.

### · Digital Storytelling

How can digital storytelling help in educational videos? Well, it's simple. You need to attract and motivate students to study. For this purpose, digital storytelling is the best choice. You can merge different images and videos.

Add cute images from your institute. Insert videos of students working together. All these will attract the student to study.

### · Get Dressed

Do you think someone will listen to you with interest if you don’t have a personality? What we wear, how we present ourselves show our personality. If you want to create stunning educational videos, then work a little on yourself first.

Before you start recording, make sure you are well dressed. The more formally you present yourself, the more your students will be attracted.

### · Plan Everything

A pro tip for creating outstanding educational videos is your planning. Before properly planning everything, you should never start making a video. You need to gather everything you might need during the video. You should properly compose yourself before you start speaking and teaching.

You should make a mind map of how you will explain things. A storyboard for the sequence of actions should be specified well before. It helps stay on top of things.

### · Busy World

What if the video you want to watch is too long and you don’t have that much time? We are very busy in different aspects. For this purpose, it is essential to keep in mind that the educational video should be concise. The video must deliver the actual concept but in a short span of time.

### · Audience Hunt

## Adobe Lightroom Color Grading Tutorial

The main focus of color grading is changing the colors and tones in your photographs. Recent updates to Lightroom and Photoshop's color grading functionality have improved its use and increased its capabilities. Color grading is ideal for giving your photograph a bit extra interest and improving the lighting.

All forms of photography benefit from and depend on color grading. The color grading tools in Lightroom and Photoshop will be especially appreciated by landscape and portrait photographers. If you're wondering what happened to split toning, it was replaced by the Color Grading module, which is why split toning is now referred to as color grading.

## 1\. Getting to Color Grading

Select the photo you want to modify and go to the develop module in Lightroom to access the Color Grading tool. Then, move your cursor down to the Color Grading menu on the right side of the screen. To see three separate color wheels, choose this.

The same choices are available in Photoshop's Camera Raw Filter. Simply scroll down on the right side of the screen once you've opened a photo in the Camera Raw Filter until you see Color Grading. The process of color grading is identical in Photoshop and Lightroom. I'll be using Lightroom to demonstrate the example photographs for the purposes of this blog article.

## 2\. How to Use Color Grading

The first thing you'll notice is that there are actually three identical color wheels. Each color wheel, though, has a distinct purpose. Midtones are controlled by the top wheel, shadows, and highlights by the left and right wheels, respectively.

Before moving on to the color grading stage, it's crucial to notice that you should balance the temperature and tint of your image. Instead of balancing the colors to create the image, color grading is a technique for enhancing the colors in the image.

Avoid using the midtones color wheel when using the Color Grading tool for the first time. First, try modifying only the highlights and shadows wheel. Warm hues in the highlights and cold colors in the shadows appear great in the majority of photographs. However, when using these sliders to create some truly incredible photos, you may let your creativity run wild!

I've added some yellow (warmth) to the highlights and some blue (coolness) to the shadows in this particular example. As a result, the sunlight in my image appears to be very warm and inviting, and the shadows take on a colder, bluer appearance.

The color wheels are actually fairly easy to use. To select a color, merely click and drag it anywhere on the color wheel. The color will become stronger the further you are from the circle's center. Each circle has a hidden slider bar underneath it. This modifies the related color wheel's brightness value. In other words, you can brighten or darken the highlights by adjusting the bar underneath the highlights color wheel. The ability to quickly change the brightness levels in the highlights, shadows, or midtones is a convenient feature.

Blending and balancing are the other two parameters that you can modify. You can alter how well the color in the highlights, midtones, or shadows blend with one another with the blending slider. The colors will blend in more naturally by moving the blending slider higher.

The amount of the image that is judged to be in the highlights, shadows, or midtones can be changed with the balance slider. For instance, if I move the balance slider to the right, less of the highlights will show the adjustment. Only the highlights with the highest brightness will be affected by the change.

## 3\. HSL/Color Panel

Move to the HSL/Color Panel, which stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance, after your image is ready to use. It is located under Tone Curve in the Develop Panel. This adjustment panel, in contrast to the ones stated before, will let you change different colors in your image independently of one another. Hue, Saturation, and Luminance are the three modifications that each color will receive.

## 4\. Hue

Hue is measured in terms of the color wheel's degrees. It's possible to change the color's real shade in this panel. For instance, you can modify the turquoise or blue to a more greenish tone if your scenario is a beach (as in our example photo). It's advisable to begin making adjustments to your panel's Hue before moving on to the others.

## 5\. Saturation

The strength of the hue is known as saturation. (Remember that this HSL panel modification only affects the saturation of individual colors, not the saturation of the entire image.) In order to achieve a more subdued, muted appearance for this example, I reduced the Saturation on the aqua, blue, and green hues. To increase the intensity of your shot, you can do the exact reverse. Find the tweaks that suit your photo and the appearance you want to achieve best.

## 6\. Luminance

Each color's luminance measures how brightly it reflects light. Use this tool to brighten or darken specific areas of your image (it works especially well to provide contrast to black and white images). To make the water and sky behind the model darker in this example photograph, I decreased the Luminance setting on the aqua panel.

## 7\. Adjustment Brush

Further isolate a section of your image using the Adjustment Brush so that you can change the Hue and any other parameters you like. Your Adjustment Brush is the final brush icon on the top of your editing panel. Adjust your Hue and begin painting on your image where you wish to change the color to begin color grading.(At the bottom of the Adjustment Brush Panel, you can adjust the brush's size or feathering.)

This is perfect if you only want to edit one part of your shot. You can keep using the adjustments after you've painted your image to witness more changes as they happen in real time.

Here are a few tips to set you on the correct course because color grading might take some time and practice to master. Shooting in RAW will give you the most dynamic control over your colors, so be sure to do this. Try your best to start with a good photograph and to alter your default settings so that the canvas is even. Use color psychology to visually transmit the mood or feeling you wish to portray through color grading.

Utilize each panel to practice and experiment. There is no right or wrong method to color grade; it all depends on how you want your photographs to look stylistically. Press the Reset button in the right -hand corner of your panel to return to your original image.

## 5 Best Video Denoisers

We all know that our recorded videos are not always perfect – when we use a mobile phone or digital cameras to shoot, our clips may contain hiss, compression and particles. These are the impurities that make our videos look uncomfortable, but it’s not a final result impossible to altar – help can come in the form of several video denoise software.

Editing is the guarantor that makes sure we can do different operations and achieve our desired results – computer programs, tools, opportunities that give us a hand in this process are kind of endless.

So, sometimes it’s really difficult to choose among so many options that come into waves. And if we choose our preferred ways, some people might not agree with us. Even so that it is quite subjective, we can still explain which tools and software we like to modify our videos, and fight with the impurities they have.

It looks amateur if the video is grainy, even if it is night shooting. We can get rid of the noise when we add lights or shoot in well-lit places, but there are some situations we can just depend on the ISO. So, for these grainy videos, there is a thing called denoising – when you get rid of the grains and make your shots as clear as possible. There are different ways to do this, and that happens in different software as well. What are the 5 best video denoisers in 2024 for us to work with? That, as we have already mentioned, might be something very subjective, but here is our selection: Wondershare Filmora, Neat Video, Shotcut, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve

**Wondershare Filmora X**

Wondershare Filmora X offers to change our damaged scene into something more acceptable. How to operate it? - You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-1.jpg)

This ensures you see the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-2.jpg)

Reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

**Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise**

We already explained how video denoising works, and we will go on with our selection and explanatory article about the process, but, as we are on the Filmora topic, we might as well mention that denoising might mean another thing too – which, in this case, regards audio background noise. It means to remove unwanted hum from the audio in order for it to become more hearable. So, doing this in Wondershare Filmora works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:

Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-3.jpg)

Double-click on the audio track and have access to the editing panel, where you can see Remove background noise – it is not needed to emphasize what this option does for you!

That’s it – you are done, but keep in mind that there is a second way to achieve the same result as well, but this in case you don’t want to detach the audio: Double-click on the video clip in the timeline, the editing panel opens, so switch to Audio. Checking the box next to Remove background noise will show that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, and of course, you can choose to your liking!

If the voice recording doesn’t sound natural anymore, you can do the following: Click on Customize and Customize Equalizer window will open.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-5.jpg)

On the left, you can see the low tunes, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often on the left, so you can lower them to get rid of them, but in order to have a more natural sound, raise the middle ones a little – and you are done when you are content with the sound!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-6.jpg)

So, hmm… back to the original topic – denoising a video, shall we?..

**Neat video**

Neat Video kind of, speaks for itself… it is a powerful video editing tool suitable for Windows, macOS and Linux. It aims to reduce the digital noise, flicker, dust, scratches and other defects in the captured videos to improve the visual quality of the videos.

It is a plug-in for Premiere Pro, that does more or less what the product noise says: it makes grainy video look neater. It’s very easy to use and

How to do that in Neat Video? Here are the steps:

Find the clip you want to reduce the noise of and search for the neat video effect in the Effects Panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-7.jpg)

The video editors mostly use the SR version of it, because it seems faster and has kind of a better performance.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-8.jpg)

Then, you’ll have to drag the neat video plug-in to the clip to your choosing, take your attention to the Effect Controls panel on the left, and find: fx Reduce Noise v5 (SR) – press the button saying Prepare and this will open up the Build button as well, which wil open the Neat video effect window.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-9.jpg)

There, you’ll need to click on the Auto Profile. Selection window will appear, which you can move around the scene and resize, in order to select the noisy area of your footage. It is recommended to find the darkest or grainiest area there and select judging by this.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-10.jpg)

On the left side, you will find Filter Settings: under Spatial, you can play with the Noise Reduction Amount and Noise Level.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-11.jpg)

Then, you will hit Apply and – done, you can instantly see the results!

**Shotcut**

What about Shotcut? It is a free, open-source and cross-platform video denoiser for Windows operating system. It is also an outstanding video editor with trimming, splitting, color correction and other tools.

In order to reduce the noise there, do the following: first off, find filters, open that window and type in: Noise. This will open the options, and several of them are for noise reduction.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-12.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-13.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-14.jpg)

Choose Reduce Noise: Wavelet, add it to the Video and then feel free to modify the settings, such as: Decompose, Threshold, Percent. You can check and uncheck the effect in order to see the before-after difference. Then, click Apply button and it is ready to go!

Anyway, you can also try other similar effects such as Reduce Noise: HQDN3D and Reduce Noise: Smart Blur.

**Adobe Premiere Pro**

Even though we discussed video denoising in Adobe Premier Pro but with the help of a plug-in called Neat Video, reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved without the plug-in as well, through using effect which is called Median. And, Premiere Pro kind of deserves to be mentioned, so, let’s go for it!

Add the desired footage into the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Then, find the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found –drag and drop the effect to the clip.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-15.jpg)

The Median should modify the grainiest parts of the whole clip, so in order to do this, we need to use masks. In the Effects Control panel, select the mask shape for the clip – the options are: rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With Pen tool, you move the Mask around the screen and resize it – the covered area will be affected.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-16.jpg)

If you change Feather setting to 100, the effect will lose a sharp edge and instead, there will be a smooth border.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-17.jpg)

So, you might think it is needed to repeat these steps several time to create masks in different areas, in order to cover all of the grainy space of the scene.

And, at last, to reduce the noise, adjust the effect settings.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-18.jpg)

Actually, Median just blurs the grainy parts, without directly taking them away. Lastly, you can get to know the Radios settings, which will help you to achieve your most desired look!

**Davinci Resolve**

DaVinci Resolve is also worth mentioning in this list, in a way because it is also different from other video editors. Let’s see how it works and, meanwhile, differs:

Add the footage into the timeline. Find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-19.jpg)

There, MediaIn1 and MediaOut1 will appear, and first, click on MediaIn1, - the scene will be shown in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find Remove Noise (RN). Click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner there is an Inspector, which opens all the properties you can modify.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-20.jpg)

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar there is channel icons. Open it and click on red, but don’t get alarmed when your footage turns black and white – it’s just for a while. Go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-21.jpg)

This step helps remove grain from the red channel. Then repeat the same for green and blue channels. After finishing go to the same channel button and set it to “back to color”. The clip will be colorized again and now be clearer, compared to the first viewer.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-22.jpg)

So, Evrika – we hot to know 5 best video denoisers in 2024, with the addition of audio background noise removal in Wondershare Filmora – hope you enjoyed it, and hope this will help you create better videos for yourself and your viewers!

This ensures you see the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-2.jpg)

Reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

**Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise**

We already explained how video denoising works, and we will go on with our selection and explanatory article about the process, but, as we are on the Filmora topic, we might as well mention that denoising might mean another thing too – which, in this case, regards audio background noise. It means to remove unwanted hum from the audio in order for it to become more hearable. So, doing this in Wondershare Filmora works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:

Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.

Neat Video kind of, speaks for itself… it is a powerful video editing tool suitable for Windows, macOS and Linux. It aims to reduce the digital noise, flicker, dust, scratches and other defects in the captured videos to improve the visual quality of the videos.

It is a plug-in for Premiere Pro, that does more or less what the product noise says: it makes grainy video look neater. It’s very easy to use and

How to do that in Neat Video? Here are the steps:

Find the clip you want to reduce the noise of and search for the neat video effect in the Effects Panel.

The video editors mostly use the SR version of it, because it seems faster and has kind of a better performance.

Then, you’ll have to drag the neat video plug-in to the clip to your choosing, take your attention to the Effect Controls panel on the left, and find: fx Reduce Noise v5 (SR) – press the button saying Prepare and this will open up the Build button as well, which wil open the Neat video effect window.

There, you’ll need to click on the Auto Profile. Selection window will appear, which you can move around the scene and resize, in order to select the noisy area of your footage. It is recommended to find the darkest or grainiest area there and select judging by this.

On the left side, you will find Filter Settings: under Spatial, you can play with the Noise Reduction Amount and Noise Level.

Then, you will hit Apply and – done, you can instantly see the results!

**Shotcut**

What about Shotcut? It is a free, open-source and cross-platform video denoiser for Windows operating system. It is also an outstanding video editor with trimming, splitting, color correction and other tools.

In order to reduce the noise there, do the following: first off, find filters, open that window and type in: Noise. This will open the options, and several of them are for noise reduction.

Choose Reduce Noise: Wavelet, add it to the Video and then feel free to modify the settings, such as: Decompose, Threshold, Percent. You can check and uncheck the effect in order to see the before-after difference. Then, click Apply button and it is ready to go!

Anyway, you can also try other similar effects such as Reduce Noise: HQDN3D and Reduce Noise: Smart Blur.

**Adobe Premiere Pro**

Even though we discussed video denoising in Adobe Premier Pro but with the help of a plug-in called Neat Video, reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved without the plug-in as well, through using effect which is called Median. And, Premiere Pro kind of deserves to be mentioned, so, let’s go for it!

Add the desired footage into the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Then, find the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found –drag and drop the effect to the clip.

The Median should modify the grainiest parts of the whole clip, so in order to do this, we need to use masks. In the Effects Control panel, select the mask shape for the clip – the options are: rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With Pen tool, you move the Mask around the screen and resize it – the covered area will be affected.

If you change Feather setting to 100, the effect will lose a sharp edge and instead, there will be a smooth border.

So, you might think it is needed to repeat these steps several time to create masks in different areas, in order to cover all of the grainy space of the scene.

And, at last, to reduce the noise, adjust the effect settings.

Actually, Median just blurs the grainy parts, without directly taking them away. Lastly, you can get to know the Radios settings, which will help you to achieve your most desired look!

**Davinci Resolve**

DaVinci Resolve is also worth mentioning in this list, in a way because it is also different from other video editors. Let’s see how it works and, meanwhile, differs:

Add the footage into the timeline. Find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-19.jpg)

There, MediaIn1 and MediaOut1 will appear, and first, click on MediaIn1, - the scene will be shown in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find Remove Noise (RN). Click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner there is an Inspector, which opens all the properties you can modify.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-20.jpg)

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar there is channel icons. Open it and click on red, but don’t get alarmed when your footage turns black and white – it’s just for a while. Go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-21.jpg)

This step helps remove grain from the red channel. Then repeat the same for green and blue channels. After finishing go to the same channel button and set it to “back to color”. The clip will be colorized again and now be clearer, compared to the first viewer.

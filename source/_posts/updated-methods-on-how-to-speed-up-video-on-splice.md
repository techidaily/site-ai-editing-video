This can be useful for creating music videos, for example, or for creating small clips that loop seamlessly through the whole video.

The loop feature in Filmora software is a great way to put your video editing skills to the test. It allows you to edit a clip of any length and then play it back over and over again, which can be useful when you're looking for an ideal looping point or want to see how long a clip is before going back to find out why it didn't work.

Let's have a look that how can we loop the video on Filmora:

**Step 1: Download Filmora for free and Create a project in it:**

**Step 3: Add Transition to the video to make it more seamless**

Lastly, If you want to make your loop more seamless then go to the Transitions tab and type dissolve in the search bar. Drag the dissolve transition between the two clips on the timeline. This can be useful when you want viewers to watch the video repeatedly.

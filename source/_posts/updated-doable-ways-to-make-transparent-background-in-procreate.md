Aspect ratio is simply defined as the relationship between the width and height of an image, video, or screen. Various video posting platforms have a standard aspect ratio for videos. So. Before posting your video creation, you have to make sure that the aspect ratio of your video aligns with the website standards.

To tweak the aspect ratio of your videos, you can use iMovie, which is a powerful [video editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and iOS devices. You can also use Wondershare Filmora which is the best alternative to iMovie and is highly compatible with both Mac and Windows devices.

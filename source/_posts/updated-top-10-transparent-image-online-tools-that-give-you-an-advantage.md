01 [What Is a GIF File?](#Part 1)

02 [Are GIF Files Subject to Copyright?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Convert a GIF File](#Part 3)

04 [6 Places to Find the Best Gifs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What Is a GIF File?

**GIF** is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format. Talking of the explicit **GIF meaning**, this one is a short motion snippet created from a set of serially arranged still images in a looping motion. Talking of the origin of GIFs, these were first introduced in 1987 by Steve Wilhite from the US based online service provider CompuServe, precisely on June 15.

**GIFs** serve as portable image formats for still and animated images, and are primarily small sized files. However, these are very well compatible with large content files too. In today’s times, GIFs are a trending means of entertainment based content sharing and intensified message delivery to target audience. Additionally, you can conveniently use motion images in the **GIF format** as effective tools of improvising and upgrading your marketing straggles for an enhanced brand promotion.

Considering the immense content varieties of GIFs, these are an eminent part of blogs, social media posts and product websites. You can even use them to objectify your emotions and feelings when conversing with peers through the latest instant messaging applications. The bottom line is, GIFs are an integral part of today’s modern and dynamic communication patterns and needs.

## Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?

The straight and simple answer to this query is a ‘Yes’. CIFs are indeed subject to copyright, just like its creative counterparts. These essentially constitute an original copyrighted creation, or may even originate from an existing copyright protected work. However, you may encounter potential glitches when choosing to work with **GIF images** while sticking with legal constraints.

Talking of the potential issues with the legality of GIF usage, there are two major concerns; the first being the sharing of unlicensed copyrighted GIF content, while the absence of legalized methods for licensed commercial use of these short motion clips being the second. Talking of possible reasons, there is again a duel. At present, there no copyright exercise from the end of original creators of GIF content, along with the absence of exact copyright claim constraints that can be imposed by content owners.

This scenario poses a potential need to look for suitable mitigation methods to curb copyright claims and disputes resulting from illegal use of GIFs. As a matter of fact, the development of a proper legal framework for undisputed GIF usage is a time consuming process. However, you can stay cautious by adhering to the following measures in the meantime:

**●** Refrain from using GIFs in a manner that would appear unsolicited to you, had you been the content owner.

**●** Take a note to credit the original creators in case3 you are using the GIF content from a known copyright source.

**●** Avoid drawing content from doubtful sources, instead search for trusted alternatives, or creating a GIF of your own would be an even better and safe choice.

## Part 3 How to Convert a GIF File

GIFs are an exciting means of creating a buzz about the information being conveyed. You can ensure an effective reach and impact of your brand if you include these catchy, short animation loops in your promotion strategy. Counting upon the credibility of GIFs, it is equally exciting to create these on your own. Try hands at experimenting with your creative skills to make and share interesting content through GIFs.

When looking for an excellent GIF creator tool, you don’t need to have second thoughts on picking up the Wondershare Filmora GIF Creator.

Music is one of the most popular video categories on YouTube, with millions of users using the site to find and discover new music. Unfortunately, making music videos that stand out in a sea of similar content is difficult. Still, suppose you are not a professional filmmaker and want to make a movie quickly. In that case, you may use a music visualizer to create music videos that you can share on social media. Most online music visualizers allow you to choose an audio spectrum template, style the visualization and even add logos or links to your social media profiles. Below are the top ten best video visualizers that can be used to edit music on Mac, Windows, iOs, Android, and online. Let's dive into details:

These visualizers are available in various forms and may be easily placed on top of a picture or video. The technology makes it simple to create audio material that is very engaging. You start by uploading your video to a drag-and-drop editor, where you can reduce your music as needed for the presentation and overlay the relevant visualizer on a photo or video. You can also include a call to action and other features to spice your multimedia masterpiece. **Features**:

With over 250 effect scenes to choose from, you'll never have to stick to one view for the duration of a song. Instead, plane9 lets you blend scenes with flawless transitions, giving you a continuous musical experience. Apart from responding to a voice taken through a microphone, it dances to any music you're listening to, whether Spotify, iTunes, or whatever. A music visualizer can also be added to OBS for hackers. **Features**:

![audio-visualizers-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/audio-visualizers-4.jpg)

**Supported system**: iOS **Introduction**: Trapp - Music Visualizer is an excellent choice for iPhone users who desire complete control over the visualization process. Change the background and color scheme, make bespoke particles by modifying their form, size, and color, and experiment with the Bass Effect to create spectacular audio visualizations.

However, the worst part is that the free edition of this audio visualizer has minimal capabilities. **Features**:

**Price**: Free to use, but premium account costs as low as $3.99/month. **Cons**:

**Supported system**: Windows **Introduction**: VSXu is a 3D OpenGL-based audio visualizer for Windows. It's open-source and free, and it has a lot of graphic effects for your music. This standalone application responds to the record channel on the soundcard and works with any media player. VSXu is a platform for running presets; it does not generate visualization on its own. Anyone can make their graphics and share them with those who are interested. VSXu thrives with unlimited possibilities because of its capacity to modify. VSXu isn't your typical graphic modeling application, even if it doesn't require you to write code. To generate images for the sound, you'll need to put in some time and work. **Features**:

* Compatible with YouTube, Spotify, Tidal, and other streaming services.
* The ability to alter the speed and intensity of each visual
* Perfect for parties: connect your PC to your television and use this music visualizer.

SongRender is the program to use if you want to rapidly create a music video with a static background and basic animated waveforms that dance with the song. You can select the output video size by clicking the social media icon. After uploading the backdrop image and audio file, you can add the waveform, which can be customized in terms of shape, color, thickness, and other factors. However, because there are no color templates, you'll have to look up color schemes to match the color of the shapes to the background. **Features**:

* Simple to use with no learning curve
* Size profiles for YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos that are ready to use
* High-quality 1080p HD music video export

**Supported system**: Windows/Mac **Introduction**: Sonic Visualiser is a free and open-source audio visualizer that may be used to view and analyze music and audio files. This is not a music visualizer for enjoyment; instead, it is designed for folks who want to know what's inside an audio file. As a result, you'll need some basic knowledge of phonetics and phonology to figure out what the depicted images mean. The solid third-party plug-ins it supports, such as pitch estimation and onset detection, are a significant element of this audio visualizer. The official lessons on utilizing it for musicological reasons may be found here. **Features**:

So it's no surprise that it's one of the most reliable music visualization tools available. The Adobe Audio Spectrum Effect is simple to utilize if you have some prior Adobe experience. Even though it is a premium-based music visualizer, there are numerous music visualization capabilities to try out. You must first create a new composition and then add the sound file to it to utilize the tool. Then, finally, you set the audio duration and leave the rest to the visualizer. **Features**:

* The camera raw image file can be edited or imported.
* When you connect to a USB, this audio visualizer instantly updates the audio device.

But that's not all; the software also allows users to visualize their music online and even create a website. Users must create an account to utilize the app because it is online-based. Once you've created an account, you'll have access to Renderforest's massive visualization templates, which you can customize with the song title, artist name, and background photo or video. Then you pick your favorite visualization style and color. Then you finish up by uploading the song you want to use in your video.

* **ProjectM Music Visualizer**

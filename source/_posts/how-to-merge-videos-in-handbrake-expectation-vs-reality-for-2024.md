Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.

The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.

Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.

Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we'll show you in this article.

## How to Change Video Thumbnail on Google Drive

**What is a Google drive?**

“Google drive is a self-hosted cloud-based site that provides free space to store your files and pictures to share them with your friends and family”.

Google Drive is also used to promote businesses or websites. You can upload a video to Google Drive and embed the file in your blog or any other website.

**What is a Thumbnail?**

“A Thumbnail is a still image that acts as

a preview image of your video.”

A thumbnail is the first thing seen by the viewers while watching videos. It is the only thing that forces the viewer either to watch the video or not because it previews the video content. It is also shown in the search results. A thumbnail is just like the cover or title of a book. You will read a book by its cover. In the same way, a video is viewed by its thumbnail.

Google drive is also used for the promotion of websites and businesses. It does not offer to add a thumbnail or cover image like YouTube has the option to set and can change the thumbnail of the video. As we all know Google drive is not a streaming platform and has its own boundaries.

Normally, the google drive can generate a thumbnail from the video and uses the generated thumbnail ignoring the one you have uploaded. But on the other hand, if it cannot generate a thumbnail the uploaded thumbnail will be displayed. Usually, the default thumbnail may have weird facial expressions or may not be attractive for the viewers to open the video.

Here we are discussing a few alternatives to change the thumbnail of the video in Google drive.

Select a separate image to be housed in a separate column to set as a thumbnail image and then go into the **details, title,** and **Image settings.**

* Right-click on that picture or icon and select the **download cover art** or **add cover art from file.**

1. **Download cover art**; if you want to add pictures from the album from the internet.
2. **Add cover art from file**; if you want to put your own thumbnail image and browse from the storage.

![change-video-thumbnail-google-drive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/change-video-thumbnail-google-drive-19.jpg)

The information will be saved automatically and the thumbnail will be changed when you open the file.

### **Important points.**

You can use any other video editor to change the thumbnail of the video but keep a few points in mind.

* Thumbnails should be added at the start of the video.
* The Thumbnail should be a few seconds long so that google drive considers it as a cover image.
* It works for short videos but it can be applied for long videos.
* Use a high-quality HD image for the thumbnail so that Google Drive can accept it as valuable for the thumbnail image.
* Thumbnails should be uploaded in **PNG, GIF, or JPG**
* The image ratio should be **16:9** and resolution of **1920x1080** pixels for PNG and JPG and **960x480** pixels for GIFs.
* The maximum file size should be
* The minimum width should be 220 pixels.

![change-video-thumbnail-google-drive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/change-video-thumbnail-google-drive-20.jpg)

Even after keeping an eye on these important points, google drive sometimes does not show the thumbnail as a cover photo.

### **Conclusion.**

In the above article, I have discussed a couple of different ways to add a thumbnail of the video and upload it on Google drive. I personally recommend Wonder Share Filmora 11 to make and change thumbnail image of the video as it is a very powerful as well as simple tool.

## Part 1 **Why Do You Need to Freeze-Frame**

Freeze-Frames is an effective and quick way to begin a drama session when you want to edit a movie. Besides, users of any age, ranging from children to adults, can easily handle it. Participants can use it to create an image using their bodies with no movement, and Freeze-Frames can also be made by individuals, a whole group, or a small group.

Another perfect way to describe a Freeze-Frame is a "still image." It is a way of pressing the pause button on the remote control and making a statue or taking a photo. The image creation can be quick without discussion, planned, or rehearsed.

Here are some reasons you need a Freeze-Frame app:

**●** They are beneficial as a quick way of communicating ideas or telling a story.

**●** In addition, Freeze-Frame can represent objects or people and even abstract concepts like atmosphere or emotions.

## Part 2 **How to Freeze-Frames in Final Cut Pro?**

**FCPX Freeze-Frame** clips can temporarily hold a particular frame in place and stop the action onscreen. The Freeze-Frame, as its phrase, freezes or contains the specific frame you want to feature or focus on in a video.

You have to pick or select the frame you want to freeze and follow the steps in the article to freeze the frame of your choice.

In addition, if you do not want to create a separate freeze-frame clip, make a hold segment to stop the action for part of a clip temporarily. This action offers more precise control, especially when a variable speed effect is created.

You can Freeze-Frame on the fly by navigating to a specific frame in a clip or during playback. Thus, A Freeze-Frame clip will preserve any attributes applied to the source clip, such as settings and effects.

Here is how to **Freeze-Frame in Final Cut Pro** effectively.

**●** Begin playback of the clip and pause

**●** Move the Skimmer or Playhead to the portion you wish to freeze.

Step 2: Choose Edit > Add Freeze-Frame (or press Option-F).

Note: How Freeze-Frame gets added to the project depends on whether it got created from the browser or the timeline:

**●** If the Freeze-Frame was from a browser clip, a new freeze-frame clip gets attached as a connected clip at the Playhead site in the timeline.

**●** Alternatively, if the freeze-frame was from the timeline, a new freeze-frame clip gets inserted at the Playhead location or the Skimmer in the timeline.

Trimming your video is one of the most effective ways to get the viewer's attention. As such, you should always trim the end and beginning of your videos to a length that will not repel viewers. Premiere Pro can help you trim videos, leaving you with tight and compelling content that engages your audience. Developed by Adobe Inc., this timeline-based video editing software application is ideal for those who want to produce the best video. We'll explain how to trim videos in Premiere Pro.

03 [Extra Tips About Trimming Videos in Premiere Pro](#part3)

## What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?

If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you'll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let's look at the differences between these two operations.

### Trimming

Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.

The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers' attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.

### Cutting

Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You'll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.

This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What's more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.

You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.

People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.

## How to Trim videos in Premiere Pro in Different Ways

You can trim video Premiere Pro on the timeline or program. Let's look at these two methods.

### Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline

If you are wondering: What is a timeline? It's the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.

Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don't alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.

To learn how to trim video in Premiere Pro on the timeline, follow the steps below.

1. Double click on the video file you want to trim in Premiere Pro.
2. Adjust the timings of your edits. Drag the ends of your video clip as if you are resizing a window to shorten or extend by trimming. As your cursor gets closer at the edge of the video clip, you'll see a red arrow.

![how to trim video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-1.png)

1. The Ripple Edit tool lets you trim video clips without leaving a white gap. You can also use it to push adjacent video clips later in the sequence.

![trim video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-2.png)

1. The Rolling Edit tool allows you to adjust the timing of the edit you make between two video clips and extends a clip by the same size you shorten the other.
2. Click the padlock icon located on the tracker header to lock the entire track and prevent unwanted changes.

![trimming video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-3.png)

1. You can also use the Q and W keys on your keyboard to Premiere Pro trim video. The Q key removes unwanted content at the beginning of the clip, while the W key trims the end of the clip.
2. Choose the Selection tool once you've finished using the trimming tools.

### Method 2:Trim Clips in the Program

You can also trim videos in the Program Monitor. Follow the guide below to learn how to trim a video in Premiere Pro program monitor.

1. Double-click the end of your video clip to enter the Trim Mode in the program.
2. To trim, drag on the images of your video in the program monitor. You can also use the buttons on the panel.

![trimming video in premiere pro program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-4.png)

1. To exit Trim mode, click an empty section in the Timeline panel.

You can change how trimming works by Command-clicking (macOS) or Control-clicking (Windows) on the images of the video in the program while you are in the Timeline panel or Trim Mode. The yellow cursor means ripple trimming, while the red pointer means regular trimming.

The benefit of trimming videos in the Program Monitor is that the precision adjustment buttons under the footage allow you to trim 1 or 5 frames at a time.

## Extra Tips About Trimming Videos in Premiere Pro

We have provided some tips that you should keep in mind when using Adobe Premiere trim video.

### How to Trim a Video without Re-Rendering?

When adding a video to Premiere Pro, it will be rendered by this software application to ensure high-quality playback and speed. Rendering takes time afterward, leading to loss of quality; however, it makes sure you have gotten the best video quality as much as possible by removing skipped frames and lag from the video playback.

If you are wondering how to trim videos in Premiere Pro without re-render follow the steps below:

1. Import your video to Premiere Pro by launching the application and choosing 'Import Media to Start'. Browse and select the video you want to trim.
2. The video will appear in the media library area at the bottom of the screen.
3. Drag and drop the video from the media library to the timeline. You'll see the complete video clip duration in the timeline.
4. You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.
5. Hold the 'Ctrl' key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You'll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.
6. You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.
7. Choose the 'Laser Tool' located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.
8. Follow steps 2 to 4 to trim from cuts you've just made.

![trimming video without re-rendering in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-5.png)

1. Go to 'File' and choose the 'Export' option. Tap 'Media' from the list, and you will be directed to the export setting. Here, you can adjust specific settings, such as quality, name, and format. Click 'Export' after entering the appropriate information.

![trim video without re-rendering in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-6.png)

### Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming

When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.

Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.

![unlink audio from video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-7.png)

Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.

### How to Trim and Re-Encode Videos without Re-Rendering

Follow the method below to trim video Premiere Pro and encode it without rendering it.

1. Launch Premiere Pro and navigate to File, then choose import. Find the video that you want to trim and double click on it.
2. Drag and drop the video into the timeline.
3. Choose the 'Ripple Edit Tool' and then Press 'Sequence'. Head to 'Sequence Settings' and set or modify the codec, bitrate, name, format, and much more.
4. Adjust the Ripple so that it defines the end time and start time that you want for your video.
5. Now, finalize the trim by choosing 'File' and tap 'Export'. To 'Export Settings,' elect 'Media'.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to trim videos in Premiere Pro, you can remove unnecessary portions at the beginning or end of your videos. In turn, your videos will attract more viewers.

### Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming

When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.

Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.

![unlink audio from video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-7.png)

Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.

### How to Trim and Re-Encode Videos without Re-Rendering

## What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?

If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you'll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let's look at the differences between these two operations.

### Trimming

Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.

The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers' attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.

### Cutting

Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You'll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.

This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What's more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.

You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.

People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.

## How to Trim videos in Premiere Pro in Different Ways

You can trim video Premiere Pro on the timeline or program. Let's look at these two methods.

You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.

Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don't alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.

To learn how to trim video in Premiere Pro on the timeline, follow the steps below.

Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.

**Step1: Create a new project & import media**

When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.

At the top menu bar again, click _File > Import > Media_ to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.

After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press _‘Import Selected’_ and then close the media window.

**Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.**

The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.

In your browser, you can set the _‘In_ and _Out’_ points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.

After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the _'Trim tool’._ Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip's endings.

If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position.

The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘_Command + 4’_ and make the adjustments.

**Effects**: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘_Effects browser’_ icon to open it.

Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.

**Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.**

**Audio & Music:** At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.

To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word _'Jingle_' and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.

**Color correction**: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.

Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.

## Conclusion

Choosing an appropriate video editing tool is equally as important as the video itself. And with the availability of so many of these video editing tools, choosing among them is quite hard. You can easily get confused especially if you are a beginner in the video editing industry. To avoid the complications you need to know what editing software is the best for your project.

 As you can see in the table above there is no great deference seen when comparing Final cut pro X vs Techsmith Camtasia, but it can tell you if is Final cut pro better than Camtasia or reverse is the case.

## Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro is the perfect macOS video editing software that can help you achieve a professional-looking video. This software is built with the latest and most powerful tools that make it an effortless tool for video editing. It has impressive filters, graphics, and a range of other cool video editing features. Its coolest part is its ability to enable 360-degree video editing for VR and VR headset playback. This program uses multi-core multi-thread machines quickly to allow you to import the videos in different formats faster than others.

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-cut-pro.jpg)

Like any other software, Final Cut Pro possesses some pros and cons as listed below;

**Pros:**

* It is a stable program that can be very useful in small businesses.
* It has a powerful architecture for your complex and heavy projects.
* Its fast rendering speed can allow you to conduct Multicam editing.
* It has classic GPU utilization and powerful media organization to allow you to organize assets such as audio and video carefully.
* Its easy audio modification capabilities can allow you to create impeccable VR videos.
* It has a customizable and streamlined share interface that makes high-quality file delivery easy and fast.
* It can edit videos offline.
* It is tailored with real-time graphics and cool effects like text and blurs that are easy to apply.

 **Cons:**

* It is complex and thus difficult for beginners.
* It has limited export options.
* It only works on Mac computers.

Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.

**Step1: Create a new project & import media**

When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.

At the top menu bar, click _File > New > Project_ to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘_Use Automatic Settings’_.

At the top menu bar again, click _File > Import > Media_ to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.

After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press _‘Import Selected’_ and then close the media window.

**Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.**

The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.

In your browser, you can set the _‘In_ and _Out’_ points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.

After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the _'Trim tool’._ Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip's endings.

If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.

To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.

**Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects**

**Title and Texts**: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video's timeline. To access those titles you can press the _'Title and Generators’_ icon in the sidebar to open it.

**Transitions**: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “_hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’_ by clicking on its indicated icon.

The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘_Command + 4’_ and make the adjustments.

**Effects**: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘_Effects browser’_ icon to open it.

Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.

**Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.**

**Audio & Music:** At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.

To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word _'Jingle_' and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.

**Color correction**: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.

Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.

To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or _'Option + Cmd + B’_.

Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.

## Camtasia

Camtasia is a perfect all-in-one video editing and screen recording program. If you compare **Camtasia vs Final cut pro**, Camtasia is quite easy to use even for beginners. It can work in both Windows and macOS and provides the user with a demonstration and education video platform. It contains cool features to help you capture and edit your videos and audios appropriately.

![camtasia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-camtasia.jpg)

Here are some pros and cons of Camtasia.

* It has a good asset library
* Availability of mobile version.
* It offers great customer service.

Here are key steps to follow when editing a video with Camtasia.

**Step 1:** Break up steps of a process with lower thirds.

Break any long multi-step video to help lower the viewer’s cognitive load.

**Step 2:** Reinforce texts with video.

Remove any mistakes and extra content such as unnecessary footage from the ends of your recording. If you trim too much drag the clip back to restore. This process is known as trimming.

You can zoom in on the most important section to focus your viewer's attention there.

**Step 3:** Add narrative to video

## Part1 Basic Knowledge About Different Framing

Because framing is related to capturing or focusing an object by the camera lens, it can vary depending on your desired shot. Let's start with the full-shot first and understand how it works.

### 01 Full Shot (FS)

Remember the shot of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, where all the players are focused in one wide frame? This excerpt is a practical example of what a full shot looks like. Full-shot video framing is particularly common in action or thriller movies where the creator wants to generate suspense in the audience.

As the name indicates, a full shot often emphasizes the scenery as your subject fills the frame. Like the background isn't ignored or blurred out; instead, it isn't overly stressed as well. In most cases, the camera starts with a wide-angle shot and then eventually ends with focusing on the subject.

A full-camera shot greatly emphasizes the physical presence of the character. It tracks the subject's movements, gestures, or body language, making it the focal point. As a result, the shot obtained delivers a better understanding of actions and interactions among the character and its surroundings.

### 02 Medium Shot (MS)

We often see friends in movies, going to a casino, or playing cards at a bar. What do we observe in that shot? Hand movements, facial expressions, body language, and a little context of what is happening in the background. This shot is known as the medium shot and is often called the Â¾ shot.

Using the medium shot video framing technique, the camera lens allows the viewers to see the background while still focusing on the main character. It's like you will know what is happening at the back but still remain close to the character's emotions and gestures.

A medium shot usually begins by showing the subject from the knees to his face. In other cases, the shot can also start from the character's waist to the top of their head. Compared to long shots, a medium shot takes you closer to the subject's emotions.

For example, in The Princess Diary, you can see how medium-shot video framing has been useful in portraying comedic scenes. You can see Mia reaching out for plates and glasses around the tables and her eyes squinting to concentrate on the process. The medium shot captures even the smallest emotions while focusing on the background.

### 03 Close-Up (CU)

When the subject's head and face take up most of the frame, framing videos is known as a close-up shot. And a particular example of this shot can be spotted in the airport scene in "Casablanca." This scene shows how the camera lens takes various shots before ending up on the actor's face, showcasing a number of emotions and intimacy.

A close-up shot is an eye-level shot, and as a result, it takes the subject to the forefront. As a result, this shot establishes a distinct sense of connection between the audience and the character. Additionally, the environmental distraction is kept minimal throughout this shot. This setup helps maintain the emotional impact that the shot will portray.

Some of the common emotions that would be captured using close-up video framing techniques include:

* Tear-filled gaze
* Furrowed brow
* Subtle smile

Cinematographers often use such shots to intensify climaxes. These shots can be viewed as a window to the characters' souls, allowing viewers to adapt the emotions on another level.

### 04 Extreme Close-Up (XCU)

To understand the extreme close-up video framing technique, let us illustrate the movie that remained our favorite action thriller while growing up: Minority Report (2002). In this movie, the shots briefly focus on the character's eyes before hopping into the future view. This extreme close shot serves as a crucial plot to develop thematic elements in the audience.

So, an extremely close shot focuses on specific details of a character. This can be either the subject's eyes, ears, or mouth. However, the shot is not often employed casually. Instead, it is used in a stance where it is appropriate and when there is a need to develop heightened emotion among the viewers.

You can see this shot as a magnifying glass that draws attention to even the smallest emotion that would have gone unnoticed otherwise.

## Part2 Master framing types

Don't know how to master framing types? No worries, we have a comprehensive guide on that! First of all, let's start with the most basic way to frame a video:

### 01 Establishing Shots

An establishing shot is usually used to develop a context for the next upcoming scene. It is often a movie's first scene and portrays an extremely wide shot of the context. This frame on the video indicates the location and time of the scene to the audience to engage with them on a deeper level.

One of the least-known things about an establishing shot is that it doesn't require a narrative to explain what is happening. Instead, it is shot alone, and the context is shot so that the audience gets to know everything as soon as they see the excerpt.

An amazing example of establishing a shot can be seen in Stanely Kubrick's horror film, The Shining. In the movie's opening scene, the camera goes through the forest and mountains before getting onto the mountaintop hotel where the action occurs.

### 02 Single Shot

A single shot frames a video that includes a single subject or character. It occurs when a character is talking or reacting to a scenario. Here, remember that if the lens shifts focus from a subject, it is not a single shot.

In the movie Extraction 2020, you can see a single shot being utilized when the character goes on to rescue his son from the kidnappers. The shot extends a long way, including through a car crash, weapon chasing, and that iconic Hemsworth sliding off a building into a brutal fight. And the incredible part was that all of this was captured in a single shot.

### 03 Two Shot/Group Shot

As the name indicates, a two-shot or a group shot is used to frame a video that involves more than one character. It could be two people conversing or friends sitting at a cafe gossiping. This shot is particularly helpful in portraying the relationship between the characters in the frame.

A good example of two-shot video framing can be seen in the movie Silverado. During the final shooting scene, you can see two cowboys standing far apart while facing each other. Here, the two-shot technique emphasizes tension before the cowboys draw their guns.

### 04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)

OTS, or Over-the-shoulder, is the most used shot in framing videos for making movies. To understand how this shot works, let us take an example of two subjects, one named A and the other named B. Now, A is sitting right in front of subject B. Here; the shot is executed by focusing on subject A from the shoulder of subject B. The basic purpose of the shot is to fill the conversation or the meeting between the subjects.

To understand this situation better, let's take an example from the movie How to Train Your Dragon. In the scene, Hiccup is seen having a conversation with his father. Here, when Hiccup is talking, the camera is focused on him over his father's shoulder. And when his father talks, the shot is taken over the shoulder of Hiccup.

### 05 Insert Shot

Insert short framing technique uses selective focus to draw the audience's attention to the subject. Whether it be an object or merely a piece of information, insert shot has always been effective in emphasizing details.

For example, in The X-Files, an insert shot is used to provide the audience with a look at the file of Scully. This insert shot reveals the most shocking revelations in the file, including a tissue sample. Additionally, the file insert shot also shows how shady Mulder is.

### 06 POV Shot

A POV shot is used to frame a video in a way that shows what a character is doing. You can take this as a shot showing the world from the character's perspective. Our modern-day games, including Call of Duty Black Ops, are a common example of such POV shots.

The movie Friday the 13th is an iconic example of a POV shot frame on video. If you remember, the movie revolved around a killer who wasn't identified until the end. So, the audience watched the film from the killer's perspective until he was recognized.

## Conclusion

To sum it up, mastering the art of video framing, from full shots to POV shots, is an exciting journey that helps you to weave exciting stories. Understanding these techniques will empower you to craft a compelling narrative to captivate your audience, whether you are a beginner or a professional.

So, begin with framing videos now and let your work speak volumes!

## Make A Countdown Video

Have you ever wanted to use Adobe After Effects to recreate a countdown timer for a rocket launch or simply create a suspenseful moment in a video by displaying how the time runs out? This tutorial will show you how. It is imperative that you become familiar with the process of creating a countdown in After Effects.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to use Adobe After Effects to put together a countdown video. This procedure is a straightforward one, and it will handle expressions as well as plugins. Stay here and read on to find out more about the various methods in which we might accomplish this goal!

Let's begin!

## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression âtimeToCurrentFormatâ within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

![create new text countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-new-text-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

![customize timecode countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-timecode-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.

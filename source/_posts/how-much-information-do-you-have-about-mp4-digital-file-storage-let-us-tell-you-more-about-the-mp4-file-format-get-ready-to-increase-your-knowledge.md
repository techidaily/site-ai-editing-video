![What is a Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-01.jpg)

What is a Lower Third

A lower third is text and/or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.

A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.

Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.

## 2\. Why Add A Lower Third

So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”

Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.

In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.

![Why Add A Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-02.jpg)

Why Add A Lower Third

Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.

As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Tips:** A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.

## 3\. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third

As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.

[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.

Tip #1

###### Use Readable Font

Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.

Tip #2

###### Don’t Make It Too Long

There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.

Tip #3

###### Use Branding

A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.

Tip #4

###### Use Templates

Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.

Tip #5

###### Keep It Simple

Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don't use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.

Tip #6

###### Emphasize With Your Lower Third

Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.

## 4\. Step By Step To Explain Filmora

Using [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it is extremely easy to create a lower third for your video.

Step5Now you want to blend both colors by choosing a blending mode. Hold the “Shift” key and “hyphen” or “=” sign on the keyboard and choose “Overlay.”

Step6To make the color stronger, go to “Layer > Solid Settings” and choose a color.

Step7Go back to “Comp 3.” Right-click on it and select “New > Light” to add a new point of light.

Step8Go back to the project panel to click on “Comp 4” to add the environment. Right-click on the Comp 4 layer and make it an environment layer.

Step9In the options that appear, set “Appears in Reflections” to “Only” and you can then increase and decrease the color saturation until you have the desired result.

## Alternative Way to Create Video Gold

Adobe After Effects is a very good video editor, but one of the things that can make it inaccessible to many users is that it can be very difficult to use. Thankfully, there is another very effective video editor that you can use to create gold text that is much easier to use.

This is the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), one of the best video editors in the market. Before we look at how you can use Filmora to create the perfect gold metal texture on your text, let's first look at some of its main features;

* You can use Filmora to edit videos at a very high resolution including 4K videos
* It can be used to remove the background and noise from the video very easily
* You can edit both video and audio in the same project
* Up to 5 text tracks and 10 music tracks can be added to the same timeline and the same project

Here's how to use Filmora to create a gold metal texture for your text;

##### Step1Install Wondershare Filmora on your Computer

Download the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) setup file to your computer and double-click on it to start installing the program to your computer.

Open the program once the installation is complete.

##### Step2Create a New Project

If you are starting from the beginning, you may need to create a new project.

To do that, click on “File > New Project” in the menu bar to start a new project.

If there was a project that you were already working on, click on “Open Project” on the main window and then click “File > Open Project” or “File > Open Recent” in the menu bar.

##### Step3Add A Title to the Timeline

To add a gold texture effect to a title on your video, we will first of all need to add a title to the project.

To do that, go click on the “Titles” tab at the top and drag one of the default titles to the timeline.

Once it is in the timeline, double-click on the title and edit it. Type in anything you want to appear in the title.

![add title to timeline gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-title-to-timeline-gold-effect.jpg)

Select the font that you want to use and choose a specific font size to use. These are all your preferences and will depend on your project.

Move the title to the second track in the timeline as you get ready to begin adding the colors.

##### Step4Start Adding Colors

Go to “Media” at the top and click on “Sample Colors.” Drag the black color image to the track directly below the title timeline.

![start adding colors gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/start-adding-colors-gold-effect.jpg)

Then take a snapshot of this newly created image by clicking on the “camera” icon next to the playhead.

![change the font gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/change-the-font-gold-effect.jpg)

##### Step5Add the Gold Effect

Delete everything from the timeline. Don't worry you took a photo of all the text layers and the effects added to each.

You will then need to find an image of a gold background. You can find these on any good background image site. Download a good clear image and upload it into Filmora.

Now drag and drop the gold background image to the second track in the timeline. Double click on the background image.

Select “Compositing” and then in the “Blending Mode” drop-down menu, choose “Darken.” Click OK.”

![blending mode composite gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/blending-mode-composite-gold-effect.jpg)

So, the first and foremost task is the installation of the Adobe Premier Pro app and then learning some basic skills in that.

There are several techniques on how to edit text on premiere pro. But here we will focus on two main approaches.

## Part 1\. Edit Text in Premiere Using the Type Tool

Firstly, go to the Adobe Premier Pro software in your window or mac. From there, choose the Type Tool option and drag the box to your video to write some text. In some cases, we may need to go to the window followed by Tools and click and hold the Type Tool. Now, coming to edit your text, you need to access Essential Graphics Workspace.

The further steps on how to edit text premiere pro using Type Tool are noted below:

* Go to the Window

* Choose Graphics from the menu. Now, you will be able to see the Essential Graphic Panel.
* Then, go to the Edit option and select Text from the dropdown options available there.

* After finishing all these steps, you now have a text layer overlaid on top of your video. From here, you can precisely personalize your text layer. You can edit the text, change the color, and so on in the new window.

* Text can be bolded, italicized, or underlined here. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, or center of the text frame and the entire window.
* If you want to create a Title Graphic, Go to the Essential Graphic Workspace. First open the Window, followed by Workspaces, followed by Graphics from the main menu. Now, if you wish to add animation to your text, you can use the Effect controls Panel where you can apply motion to the texts.

So, following all these steps on how to edit text in adobe premiere with this tool, we can work in less time and create professional videos.

## Part 2\. Use Text Templates in Premiere Pro

While learning video editing in Premiere Pro, you will choose a suitable template, right? So, to make your title look more professional, you need to replace the text variant and adjust the color. In the Adobe Premiere pro, you can choose your preferred template as dozens of templates are available there. You can find the one and opt for which you want to select by simply dragging it to the timeline. Here's a complete process on how to edit text in adobe premiere pro using text templates:

* Open the Adobe Premier pro and select browse on the right-hand "Essential panel". Then activate it. It will help you with the quick export of your templates that are in the library.

![essential panel premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/essential-panel-premiere-pro.jpg)

* Now, opt for “edit tab” from where you can opt for the text alignment and addition of the transparency. Further, you may manually tilt or rotate text here.
* Then, you have to choose the font and its size. If you have to opt for resizing a video, do so by the selection of the required font. You can then go for the adjustment of the size of the text that’s there on the “Edit tab”. The icons will be disabled in the case if there is no support for bold and/or italic options. Furthermore, if you wish to underline any object, you can easily add it to a font.
* At this point, opt for the addition of color/effects to the text. You will see options like fill and stroke. (An outline around the shape of a text), shadow, and many more.

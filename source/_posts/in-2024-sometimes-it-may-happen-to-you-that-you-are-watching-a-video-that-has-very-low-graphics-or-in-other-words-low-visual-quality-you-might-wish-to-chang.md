For a lasting impression on the celebrant, consider adding these when you **create a birthday slideshow.** A birthday slideshow should have the following:

**●** Background music

Lighten up your video with some background music. A slideshow just displaying photos without music isn't a good idea.

**●** Meaningful Quotes and greetings

You can spice up the birthday video by adding greetings, quotes, and well wishes to let the celebrant know you want to them feel fantastic.

**●** Make the video personal

Add a personal touch to the clip by adding things that matter to the celebrant, whether pictures of them taken while performing a hobby or a favorite place. You can also use photos of their achievements from the time of their last birthday to the present one.

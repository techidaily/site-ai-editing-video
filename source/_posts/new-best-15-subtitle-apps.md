Launch Filmora and add the video clip that contains the track you want to modify for your project.

* After selecting the audio or video clip, go to Tools, followed by Audio. You will find the Silence Detection option. The Silence Detection window will appear once you touch this option.

##### Step3Modify the Settings for the Silence Detection Feature

![silence detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step3.JPG)

You may change the threshold or sensitivity to make it work for you. The sensitivity level determines the size of the pause. Thus, a lower sensitivity level records longer pauses. You can fine-tune three crucial Filmora Silence Detection settings in this step.

First, you should adjust the volume threshold to fix a specific value for silence. This parameter tells the algorithm how loud you want it to be before it becomes annoying. By default, 25% is the volume threshold. It implies that the software will consider segments silent if their volume threshold value is less than 25%.

 Now, you should adjust the Minimum Duration option. It tells Filmora how long a period of quiet or low-volume sound should be. Just 0.5 seconds is the default minimum duration. In other words, for 0.5 seconds to be considered quiet, there must be no sound.

 You can also set the Softening Buffer value. This setting allows you to add a little delay before and after audible parts begin and finish. With 0.1s set as the default, the softening buffer starts to work. It implies that the beginning and end of the audible parts may each have their own 0.1-second buffering time.

##### Step4Eliminate Any Found Silences

![choose analyze option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step4.jpg)

Hit the "Analyze" button after you're happy with the settings. The Filmora will detect and remove the silent areas in your audio track.

The software also highlights segments in two different colors. Seen in black are the portions that do not contain any sound. The highlighted sections indicate the audible portions.

##### Step5Evaluate Your Work and Adjust

![evaluate your work and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step5.JPG)

You can make sure the video segments move without a hitch. Thus, listen to the modified audio track again. You can adjust the clips in the timeline to customize the edit directly if necessary.

Of course, you also have the option to tweak the three audio settings listed in step 3\. Next, choose Restart to remove the silent segments from your video.

##### Step6Export Your Video Clip

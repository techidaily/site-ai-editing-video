**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind.

## How to Add Miniature Effect in Video with Filmora

Want to add selective blur to make everything look smaller? Don't have any idea how to focus on specific mini-things? Then don't worry! In this article, you'll get a step-by-step process to add miniature effects to your video. At the end of the process, you'll have cinematic shots. Then start with us now! Scroll more to get pro tips!

## What Is a Miniature Effect?

![after adding a miniature effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-1.jpg)

But first, let's learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.

However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we're seeing is actually a tiny model.

![a miniature effect for landscape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg)

To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:

* It utilizes **selective blur** to make things appear like **small**
* The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from **a high angle**.
* The tiny effect is usually used in **drone footage, time lapses**, or **landscape photography**.

Are you all set to add miniature effects to your video and make film-like shots? Then scroll more and get the step-by-step process.

If you don't have good-quality footage, but want to boost your video, here is how. You can get the miniature effect without a big format view camera or specialized lens.

* Open Filmora and select any stock footage in Wondershare Filmora.

![choose stock footage from stock media in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-3.jpg)

Move to the **stock media** folder on the above bar in the Wondershare Filmora. Or you can look towards the left window, where you will see the sample **videos tab.**

* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.

Here you will see almost more than **20 videos.** So, instead of using the actual recorded footage, we'll make do with what we have by **default**. After selecting and adding the stock footage of your choice. Then you have to follow the below process:

* First, hold the Stock Footage as shown in the folder section.
* Then **Drag and Drop** it to the timeline section for further editing.

![add stock video in the timeline in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-4.gif)

**Who will get Stock Media?**

Want to get stock media? You can only have access to the stock media library if you already buy the license of Wondershare Filmora.

* The **latest version** has an unlimited stock library.
* After purchasing any plan, you can access **Stock Media** (Unsplash, Giphy, Pixabay, Pixel).

##### Step3 Head to the effect panel

As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a **Blur** effect on the video.

![search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-5.gif)

To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:

* First of all, move toward the above tabs.
* Then click on the 5th section, which is **Effect**
* After selecting the effect tab, a new window will **pop up**.
* In this section, we have **500+** different effects.
* Then, **click** on the search bar.
* **Search** for the Blur effect.
* After that, click on the **Blur 2**
* Then **Download** this effect if you haven't done this already.

##### Step4 Add the blur effect to the video

After selecting and downloading the blur effect, it's time to add it to the video. Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:

* **First, drag** and **Drop** the effect toward the timeline.
* Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.

![add effect on the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-6.gif)

##### Step5 Add the effect multiple times

Want to get an ideal blur level? If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:

* First, ensure that the **opacity** of the blur effect is 100%.
* Then, if you still want more blurriness, add **Blur 2** effect multiple times on the video.
* Finally, add effect by just the **Drag and Drop**

![add blur effect in video multiple times](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-7.gif)

##### Step6 Drop the same video clip

* Add the same video clip 2nd time on the timeline.
* Add it by just the **Drag and Drop**
* Make sure you add it to 2nd video track in the timeline above the first one.

![add the same video for 2nd time on the timeline in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-8.gif)

##### Step7 Add masks on the Video

Now, it's time to select a specific video portion and add a mask. Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:

* **Double-click** on the video present in 2nd track.
* The settings tab will be open in the top left section.
* Then find the **Mask** section and click on it.
* After this, **click** on the **Double-line**.
* Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.

![add mask to the video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-9.gif)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.

Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!

![rotation of mask in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif)

For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can't get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:

![blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif)

* Make a building or any object **Blurry** near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.
* While the **object is far** from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.
* Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.

Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:

![changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif)

* Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.
* **Settings** will activate on the top left side.
* Then click on the **Mask** tab to open it.
* Select the **Rectangular** mask from the list and apply it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.

Now, it's time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:

* Add the same stock video clip a **third time** on the third video track of the timeline.
* Then add a mask in a **Rectangle** shape on the building.
* Don't **blur** the edge of this mask.

![mask the object far from the camera for the main focus](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-13.gif)

##### Step8 Final Look

You are excited now to see the final look of your miniature effect! Finally, it's in front of you! Just modify it more if you want to make it more precise.

![final look of miniature effect on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-14.gif)

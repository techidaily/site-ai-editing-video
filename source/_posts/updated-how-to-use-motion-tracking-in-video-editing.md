## How to Use Motion Tracking in Video Editing

Motion tracking makes it easier to follow the movement of objects and provide the sensed data to a program for additional processing. Motion tracking involves recording an object's movements that match a previously stored motion template. This has a wide range of uses, including in robotics, entertainment, sports, the military, and the entertainment industry. Additionally, it is utilized in the creation of video games and films. While motion tracking is frequently referred to as match movement in the film and video game industries, motion tracking is frequently referred to as motion capture in other contexts.

## Part 1\. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking

We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let's quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,

Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion  
Add text or solids as additional compositional elements  
Add 3D elements to 2D footage  
Use effects or color gradation methods  
Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television

These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.

## Part 2\. What software do you need?

There are numerous options for motion tracking applications. With advantages and downsides, we've compiled a list of the finest motion tracking programs. The following are the best video editors for motion tracking in our opinion:

### Filmora

Wondershare created [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to enable you to fully express your creativity. FilmoraPro is the best option if you want to make some high-level modifications to your video. In addition to the pre-sets offered, it allows you to tweak the effects for a more expertly edited appearance.

![filmorapro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/MotionTracking1.png)

Motion tracking is currently its best feature. You may track a skater as they race across the ice or follow a boat as it travels. Use the motion tracking feature to add drama to your videos. You won't have to worry about getting lost because FilmoraPro features an amazingly simple UI. Simply click on the person or object you wish to track and choose Motion Track from the Effects menu.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Blender

Open-source and cost-free motion tracking software is called Blender. It's an excellent 3D creating tool. Modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing, 2D animation, and of course motion tracking is all supported.

![blender video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-video-editing.jpg)

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

![kdenlive adjust slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kdenlive-adjust-slider.jpg)

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

![hitfilm express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hitfilm-express.jpg)

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award. It enables you to accurately attach images and messages and even adjust for shifting perspective. You can hide faces, license information, and any private objects using this capability.

![vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

### Adobe Premiere Pro

Because of its superior editing capabilities, Premiere Pro seems to be a requirement for anyone learning video editing. Premiere Pro, however, has a limited number of presets and automatic tools in order to provide consumers the most control.

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

When masking and blurring a face, motion tracking only works with the auto option. If not, you will need to enter and alter multiple keyframes to add text or resize the video, or you will need to install an extension to convert the mask's tracks to any transformed parts.

### PowerDirector

Due to its simplicity of use, PowerDirector is unquestionably among the greatest motion tracking programs currently available. It accomplishes complex effects without having an advanced learning curve, in contrast to other video editing tools. As demonstrated in the introductory video up top, a simple interface may be used to easily track and manage one or more motion-tracked items.

![powerdirector for mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-mac-5.jpg)

With this program, creating a simple motion track may be done in only three easy steps. This editor is for you if you want to finish the job swiftly and painlessly and are new to intermediate video editing.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.

## How To Cut Videos For Instagram On Mac

More video content is being created than before. Unfortunately, some social media platforms like Instagram require your video to be short.

![cut-video-instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-instagram-1.jpg)

Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours.

That’s why video cutters enter the picture.

Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.

Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.

Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.

A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac.

Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.

However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.

## Part 1: How to Slow Down Videos in YouTube?

If you watch YouTube videos often, you must have been aware of the **YouTube slow-down** feature. The playback adjustment option on YouTube helps with that. By enabling that option, the whole YouTube video slows down. For adding slow-motion effects at specific durations, you can use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). In this part, we’ll explore both methods of slowing down a YouTube video:

* [Method 1\. Direct Method](#method1)
* [Method 2\. Using Wondershare Filmora](#method2)

### Method 1\. Direct Method

If you have the YouTube application, you can commence this action straight. If not, you can also open YouTube on your browser. Given below are the steps to **play YouTube in slow motion**:

##### Step 1

Once you play a YouTube video, navigate towards the bottom of this video. Afterward, click on the "Settings" option and select the "Playback speed" option.

![access playback speed settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-1.jpg)

##### Step 2

From the expansion menu, select a playback speed option as per preferences. You can select a speed between 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25\. Afterward, play your video and see if the speed is right. This is the simplest method for **YouTube video slow motion**.

### Method 2\. Using Wondershare Filmora

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

#### Step 1Downloading a YouTube Video

YouTube doesn't allow users to download a YouTube video on their devices. Hence, you will need third-party support to do so. Many sites offer YouTube video download services. We are using the [y2mate.com](https://www.y2mate.com/en870), and here are the steps for it:

**1\. Copy the YouTube Video Link**

First, access the respective video that you want to download from YouTube. Locate the "Share" option at the bottom of this video and select it. Then click the "Copy" option to copy your video's link.

![copy link of youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-3.jpg)

**2\. Access the Site**

After copying the video's link, access the site using your web browser. In the "Search or paste link here" box, paste the video link and click "Start." From the download options appearing at the bottom, select a suitable option. Click on the "Download" button adjacent to your option.

![open and download youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-4.jpg)

#### Step 2Slow Down YouTube Video in Filmora

Once you have downloaded the video on your device, it is time to **slow down the YouTube video**. Filmora offers a plain and simple method to slow down a video. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you create video slow-mo in Filmora:

**1\. Import the YouTube Video**

Since Wondershare Filmora is a desktop tool, you must download it first. Initiate it and click the "New Project" option to reach its editing interface. Click on the "Import" option to import the video you downloaded. Afterward, bring this video to the timeline using the drag-and-drop technique.

![import video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-5.jpg)

**2\. Access Uniform Speed**

Select the video in the timeline and direct it toward the settings panel appearing on the right side. From the given tabs, go to the “Speed” tab and select “Uniform Speed.” Further, adjust the “Speed” slider or its value in the given box. This will slow down your video, and you can preview it to adjust further.

![access speed settings and change](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-6.jpg)

#### Step 3Smoothing Out the YouTube Slow-Mo

Upon previewing the YouTube slo-mo, you might notice some roughness in it. For creating a smooth slow-mo, use the Optical Flow option. Here are the steps to enable this option in Filmora:

**1\. Enable the Optical Flow Option**

Navigate toward the "AI Frame Interpolation" section. You can find it at the bottom of the Uniform Speed tab. Afterward, expand this section and select the "Optical Flow" option.

![look out for ai frame interpolation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-7.jpg)

**2\. Render the YouTube Slow-Mo**

Once you have enabled optical flow, direct it toward the timeline tool panel. Select the "Render Preview" option from there and see your video afterward. You'll have a professional-level slow **YouTube slow-motion** video.

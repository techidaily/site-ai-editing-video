## Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters You Should Know

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

## Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters

To be able to convert presentations, you must have PowerPoint installed.

### 2.Leawo Video to PPT Pro

![leawo-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/leawo-poster.jpg)

**Price: $44.95**

PowerPoint presentations in PPT, PPTX, PPTM, POT, or POTX file formats may be converted to practically any video file type with our video to ppt converter. PowerPoint 2000 through 2016 (both 64-bit and 32-bit) are all supported, as are all versions of the program.

Leawo Video to PPT Pro's video files is compatible with iPhone and Android smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and Apple TV. You can turn your PowerPoint presentations into high-definition films with narration and other audio files using this program. Share your movies with the world through the likes of DailyMotion, Vimeo, YouTube, and Metacafe.

##### Pros

The ability to do unlimited batch conversions at once.

Requirements for a complicated system.

### 3.iSpring River

![ispring-river-poster.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ispring-river-poster.png)

**Price: $97 for a single lifetime license**

Installing iSpring River on your PC turns it into a PowerPoint add-on that you can use from the ribbon. This isn't a limitation since iSpring River allows you to convert PPT files to widely suitable video file formats like MP4 or AVI, even though it's not stand-alone computer software. In addition, you may choose the video size and compression parameters before each file conversion using the add-video on's settings.

All of the original PowerPoint presentation's animations and audio files, as well as transitions and font and text formatting, will be included in the final film. Video files exported from iSpring River may be uploaded straight to YouTube, but no other social media services such as Dropbox or Google Drive are supported.

There isn't any support for high-definition video.

### 4.RZ PowerPoint Converter

![rz-powerpoint-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rz-powerpoint-poster.jpg)

**Price:** _There is a free version available, and prices begin at $29.99._

Using this sophisticated converter, any PPT files made with 2013 or previous versions of PowerPoint may be quickly converted to movies. RZ PowerPoint video to ppt converter also allows you to create HD video files that can be readily shared online, as well as files that can be burnt to DVDs.

Any current video playback device can play videos generated with this program, and the quality is so outstanding that you can play them on huge LCD displays. Though this video to ppt converter is accessible for free, its free edition lacks all of the capabilities that make this program an excellent alternative for professionals that prepare PowerPoint presentations on a consistent basis. It's possible to get the commercial edition of this Windows-based tool and have all of the multimedia you include in the presentations converted to video without losing any quality.

##### Pros

You may use this to burn DVDs.

All PowerPoint file types are supported.

##### Cons

However, basic PPT to video file conversion is only available in the free edition of the product.

### 5.Camtasia Studio

![camtasia-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camtasia-studio-poster.jpg)

**Price: A free trial is offered, and a single-user license is $249.**

There is much more to Camtasia Studio than simply a video to ppt converter in it. An unencumbered trial edition of this video editing program helps you create professional-looking films from PowerPoint presentations. Camtasia Studio's single-user license is a good alternative for those who just need to convert a few presentations for free, but if you're searching for a full-featured video to ppt converter, you should consider purchasing Camtasia.

When using the software's premium edition, you may add multimedia files, such as PowerPoint presentations and webcam footage to your final video project. With Camtasia Studio, you can easily post your films in nearly any video file type on social media.

##### Pros

With Camtasia Studio, adding transitions, callouts, or text effects is a cinch.

Advanced video editing tools are available.

##### Cons

Only 30 days are included in the free trial.

Expensive.

## Conclusions

On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk. PNG files also describe the features of an image very well. This means that it represents intricate details such as gradient, transparency, and other well-defined features very neatly.

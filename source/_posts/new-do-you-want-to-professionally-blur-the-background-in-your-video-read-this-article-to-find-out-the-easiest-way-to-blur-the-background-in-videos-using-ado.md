## Do You Want to Professionally Blur the Background in Your Video? Read This Article to Find Out the Easiest Way to Blur the Background in Videos Using Adobe After Effects

While capturing a video, it may be possible that the background of the video looks dull or tedious. Or, unwanted people in the background are ruining the overall presentation. To get rid of this, many people use Adobe **After Effects to blur the background** in the video. If you don’t know how to use After Effects, this article will provide you with accurate guidance. Moreover, we will also highlight an alternative to Adobe After Effects for additional help.

## Part 1: What Do You Need To Blur Background in Videos?

There are many scenarios in which blurring the video background becomes necessary. In this part of the article, we will discuss some common scenarios in which people feel it is mandatory to blur the video background.

### 1\. To Put Focus on Subject

If you want to keep the spotlight on the main subject of the video, blurring the background becomes essential. By doing so, you can highlight and grab viewers' attention to the subject of your video.

### 2\. Replacing Background

Sometimes choosing and capturing a vibrant background for your video is tough. So, if you have a dull background in your videos that does not look aesthetic, you can simply blur it. There are various blur effects that you can add to the background of your video to create an overall sophisticated presentation.

### 3\. Hiding Sensitive Information

There are some places, such as museums or private properties, where you cannot take a video without the owner's permission. The reason is that there might be sensitive information in such places that needs to be confidential. So, if you are making a vlog in such places, you can blur the video background to avoid copyright strikes on social media platforms.

### 4\. Ensuring Privacy

If you are making a tutorial video while sitting at home, you may concern about the privacy of your family members or house. Thus, in such cases, blurring the video background can be a safe idea to ensure the privacy of your home.

## Part 2: How to Blur the Video Background in After Effects?

Do you want to blur the background in the video where the subject is moving continuously? This may sound complicated to you; however, using Adobe After Effects can make this process quite simple and easy. [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) is a professional software that many users utilize to execute professional editing. Using this efficient platform, you can smoothly make eye-catchy intros and outros for your videos.

Moreover, you can add transitions to your videos to generate compelling results. So, if you want to add stunning and appealing visual effects to your video, Adobe After Effects is the best choice.

### Steps to Blur Background in Adobe After Effects

Step1 Open Adobe After Effects and upload the video clip you want to edit. Once done, double-click the video you have added to the timeline to select the clip you want to blur.

To blur the background in the video, search for “Gaussian Blur” in the effects tab. After applying this effect to the copied layer, increase the blur effect and wait for the calculations.

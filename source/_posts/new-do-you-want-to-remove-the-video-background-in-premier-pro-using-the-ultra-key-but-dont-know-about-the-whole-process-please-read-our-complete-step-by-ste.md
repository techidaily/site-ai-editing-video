## Do You Want to Remove the Video Background in Premier Pro Using the Ultra Key but Don’t Know About the Whole Process? Please Read Our Complete Step-by-Step Tutorial and Learn From Scratch as a Beginner

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the leading video editing software. You can use to create or remove a video's background. Advanced Chroma Key features such as Color Key and Ultra Key make it possible to produce background-free content quickly.

Let's get right to it and start the tutorial!

## How to Use Premiere Pro to Remove Video Background?

Adobe Premiere Pro can remove video backgrounds quickly using the **Ultra Key** feature with the following steps:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser, and download the appropriate Adobe Premiere Pro version for your [Windows PC](https://adobe-premiere.en.softonic.com/) or [Mac](https://filehippo.com/mac/download%5Fadobe-premiere-pro-cc-for-mac/).

**Note:** You can also search for the Ultra Key in the Adobe Premiere Pro search bar. Drag it to the video clip containing a background you want to remove.

Step4 As soon as you drop the Ultra Key to your footage, an **Effects Control panel** will pop up. Next, use the **eyedropper tool** in the Effects Control panel. Finally, select the background color on your video that you want to remove.

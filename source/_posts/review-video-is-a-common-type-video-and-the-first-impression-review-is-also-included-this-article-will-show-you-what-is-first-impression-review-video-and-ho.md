## How to Turn Text Into a Podcast

Being a content creator, either writing or generating videos, requires podcast text-to-speech knowledge. The impact of content depends on how many people see it. It means finding new ways to get it into real and virtual places where customers and users might be.

Depending on the context, podcasting can be a perfect alternative for sharing content.

This article will address your questions about the easiest way to turn a blog into a podcast. Let's begin with the reasons why you should do a podcast.

## Part 1\. Why You Should Podcast

Podcasts are one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways. It helps to advertise yourself and your products to a highly targeted audience. Podcasts are also excellent for engaging with potential clients interested in your content. In your field, you can achieve fame and expertise.

![effective podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-text-to-speech-1.jpg)

### Repurposing of Content

Podcasters can maximize their potential for successful episodes and repurposing their podcast into multiple content pieces.

This podcasting strategy can help you reach more people by putting your podcasts on more channels and engaging more people who might be interested.

### More Fulfilling than Articles

Unlike music, news, TV, and social media, podcast listeners don't have to watch the screen like they do with YouTube videos or TV shows. This means they can listen while walking or driving home from work.

Podcasts are the best way to get people to pay attention and make fundamental societal changes. They can keep people interested for a long time, so you can go into detail and get personal without turning off your audience.

### Minimal Start-Up Costs

To start a podcast, you can spend a little money. Even some of the most famous podcasts use a microphone, a computer, and software for recording. But it's common to spend more money on advertising and better hosting.

Starting a podcast doesn't cost much, as you can get everything you need for about $145.

### Expansion of Search Potential

In the past few years, many big brands and small to medium-sized businesses have started using podcasts as a marketing strategy. This is because podcasts are becoming more and more popular and can help raise your company's profile.

Podcasting is another way to disseminate your study to a broader audience, whether that audience consists of policymakers or interested citizens.

### Potential to Monetize

Using an affiliate program podcast, you can earn money. Businesses can increase their income by offering paid advertising sponsorships to monetize podcasts. Suppose you accept an affiliate offer to sell ads. In that case, you become the company's voice and put recorded ads in your podcast episodes.

The most common way to make money from a podcast is through sponsorship. It's also the easiest way to make money because you don't have to make or sell anything. You just have to make a deal with a sponsor.

## Part 2\. Why Are Writers Hesitant to Start a Podcast?

Even after knowing all these benefits, writers are still hesitant to start a podcast. One of the main reasons a writer may be reluctant to launch a podcast is the cost of the necessary equipment. You will need at least $80 to $500 for this unpromissing business.

However, let me tell you a secret that many podcastors didn't buy any audio equipment for the launch of their podcast channel on Spotify.

Moreover, many writers don’t want to show their voice through recordings. This is because they couldn’t just make a recording and hand it off to a sound specialist. Besides, finding their voice through the stories they write is the routine.

But we all need to get the truth that many podcastors don't record a single word of the podcast with their own voice. Due to a solution: text-to-speech, technology like this has been around for a while and continues to improve.

The two important issues have been solved, so what are you waiting for? Platform building has always relied heavily on content marketing. With blog posts and social media, additional support was provided, and now podcasts are becoming more commonplace.

## Part 3\. How to Turn a Text Into a Podcast?

### Text To Speech

To turn your text into audible content, Text-to-speech (TTS) is an assistive technology. With a single click, TTS reads your written text aloud. Many people also use it for writing and editing to maintain audience concentration.

Text-to-speech technology is compatible with all digital devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. Increasing numbers of websites and products now have developed this function. For example, you can find it within the trusted video editing software like Filmora. With [Filmora's Text to Speech (TTS) feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you may add extra aspects to your video by turning your text files into voiceovers.

Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.

Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.

Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the **custom slide show** creation process with the finest details:

**User's Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint**

In this article we will give you a brief overview of what After Effects is, what it's used for and by who and the overall experience!

With that said, let's get started!

![adobe after effects review](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adobe-after-effects-review-01.jpg)

## 1\. Speed and Stability

When talking about speed and stability, After Effects has the latest release packed with improvements. All the developers have focused themselves on speed and also performance. The team at Adobe have worked very hard to make this application more responsive and when we go along in this article, that can be seen in many ways

The main improvement which is immediately clear to all users, is the renewed preview playback optimization. What we noticed is that After Effects is creating the ram preview for your projects a lot faster. However, while working with the software for this article, we did find the user interface to be more responsive, the playback is way smoother, so is it a lot more stable overall.

While using shape layers, there was a significant improvement. A few expressions are a lot faster. This alone is worth upgrading to the latest version of After Effects.

![speed and stability](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adobe-after-effects-review-02.jpg)

## 2\. User Interface

The After Effects interface is constructed up of four main parts. The Timeline panel, the Project panel, the Composition panel and the Effects panel.

### The Timeline Panel

In the Timeline panel, you edit all the footage and clips to create your rough cut. You can find the Timeline panel on the bottom of the workspace.

### The Project Panel

It's pretty straightforward that in the Project panel you import your footage and create your project. This is located on the top left of the standard After Effects workspace.

### The Composition Panel

The Composition panel is where you will see the final product. This is located in the middle of your workspace.

### The Effects Panel

In order to make creative changes to your video, use the preview, audio, effects, and Preset Panels. These panels are located on the upper right area of your workspace, each one also has its dropdown.

## 3\. Learning Curve

The learning curve for After Effects depends on your background, the best way to find out if you like it is starting a free trial. Go through some tutorials online or paid courses. You'll also want to spend time with the User Guide. The Search Help field in the top right corner provides you an easier search for answers to most questions that you have. Speaking of YouTube and online learning, most of the video tutorials you will find have been created by people that are experienced in After Effects and know their way around it.

## 4\. VFX

There's a time-period when video editors require strengthening their skills, calling it imperative software for improving editing skills is nowhere near an exaggeration. it really helps prospective professionals improve their learning experience through visual effects, camera tracking, text animation, motion tracking, color grading, etc. All of these methodologies do help in improving the VFX learning process in the long run.

Video editing happens to be a crucial part of film production. Making videos in a fantastic process can indulge in building professional videos via motion graphics animation. This is where Adobe After Effects become an excellent learning tool.

## 5\. Motion Graphics

Motion graphics can sound quite scary. It's a new term for a specific genre of animation. Motion graphics is the intersection between animation and graphic design. These are purpose-driven visual aspects with the goal of showing information to the viewer through the use of animated graphics or text. Sometimes they include voice-overs narrating what the text or graphics are showing. Where it gets a little complex is that the more popular the term motion graphics becomes, the more people are misaligning animations to it. They need to represent information and illustrate the idea to the viewer clearly, so they do that using animation and motion graphics.

## 6\. Titles and Outros

Adobe released a new combination of features for you. For Adobe Stock: Graphics templates. Those pre-made templates give you a super smooth way to discover new motion graphics within Premiere Pro, without needing to spend time creating titles, overlays, or animations from scratch. The world has digitalized, and videos often need visual aspects such as titles, lower thirds, to present information. The templates not only assist video editors increase the quality of the content by showing certain information, but they also give a strong visual touch to keep the viewer engaged throughout the video. The audience nowadays is a lot more sophisticated, meaning that motion graphics are a necessity in a driven media world.

Motion Graphics templates are valuable for video editors of all levels. For the beginning content creators, the templates offer great quality, ready-made footage to help their creative goal. They can explore and work on their skills. Motion graphics that are pre-made are an excellent way to express the vision and express inspiration to new opportunities.

So now that you are aware of what After Effects templates are, we can move on to the actual workflow, why it is important, and how to use it as efficient as possible.

## 7\. Workflow

Whether you are using Adobe After Effects to create motion graphics, or composite realistic visuals, you usually follow the same workflow, you may repeat the process of adjusting layer properties, editing, and compositing until everything looks good. You can change any property of any element, such as position, opacity and size. Make use of motion tracking to stabilize footage so that it follows the motion from another clip, and so much more!

## 8\. Rendering Speed

When it comes to exporting your project in After Effects, you don't need to buy an expensive workstation. You can speed up your rendering process from your own laptop without investing too much and by using the following tips we have for you below!

### Tip #1: Enable Multiprocessing

What exactly is multiprocessing? That is when After Effects uses multiple cores from your CPU to export multiple frames at once. If your processor has one or more cores, you can enable this feature to reduce your rendering time. We want to mention that you need to check whether or not this option is turned on. Once enabled, you'll see a great decrease in export time.

To enable Multiprocessing, navigate to Preferences > Memory & Multiprocessing. Then you click the check box next to 'Render Multiple Frames Simultaneously' and remember also to adjust the settings that you need.

### Tip #2: Optimize Your RAM Usage

The RAM memory inside your workstation can be used to write and read data at a lot higher speeds than regular hard drives and portable drives. Configuring your RAM in a system is one of the easiest upgrades for better performance. Giving you affordable solutions for both desktop and laptop systems, the RAM memory upgrade does not require a lot of knowledge. The more RAM you allow applications to use, the higher the performance you will get out of it.

It also shows a noticeable increase in rendering speed. When the export time in your work is longer than needed, look at your RAM memory and see if you can make the necessary changes or upgrades.

### Tip #3: Use the Media Encoder

Let's talk about the Media Encoder. It's the software that comes up with Adobe Creative Cloud products such as After Effects and Premiere Pro to simplify the export process. You can easily render your project from After Effects to Adobe Media Encoder and begin the project render process from that point on. The Media Encoder will increase your rendering performance and will significantly decrease rendering time.

### Tip #4: Disable Ray-Traced 3D

The included After Effects Ray-Traced 3D feature enables you to produce 3D models within After Effects without any struggle. Calculating all the motions and visual graphics is such a heavy process for your workstation. When you disable raytracing, you will get a faster export time. By looking that 'Classic 3D' is checked instead of 'Ray-Traced 3D' from your composition preferences, you can speed your rendering speed up to 50%. Isn't that incredible?

![disable ray traced 3d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adobe-after-effects-review-03.jpg)

### Tip #5: Activate GPU Exporting with Cuda Acceleration

Exporting your videos with GPU rather than CPU will increase the efficiency of your render process. The export length will decrease a whole lot when you activate Mercury GPU Acceleration, also known as 'CUDA' from the 'Project Settings'.

After Effects doesn't really require CUDA features from a special kind of Nvidia GPU. Only the GPU accelerated 3D renderer, that is based on the raytracing algorithm, requires that. The other GPU features are running on any GPU that meets the basic minimums, including Intel and AMD GPUs.

## 9\. System Requirements for Windows

These are the minimum specifications needed to use After Effects on PC:

**OS:** Windows 10 (64-bit) versions 1909 and later, or Windows 11

**CPU:** Intel or AMD Quad-Core Processor (Intel i5 and i7 will do the job)

**RAM:** 16 GB

**Monitor resolution:** 1280 x 1080

An internet connection

## 11\. Keyboard Shortcuts

You can work visually when you configure your keyboard shortcuts with the visual keyboard shortcut editor within After Effects. You can use the keyboard user interface to show the keys that have been assigned to shortcuts, the available keys for assignment, and edit assigned shortcuts to make your workflow even easier.

## 12\. Should You Buy It?

Well first, you cannot buy After Effects, Premiere Pro or other software from Adobe. You have to rent them by paying monthly. After Effects is primarily a compositing and graphics software. Premiere is primarily a video editing program. In the case of After Effects and Premiere Pro, it's not really an either/or. They're both software with different purposes. After Effects is a lot more powerful and essentially showcases most of Premiere's functionality, but according to our experience, the Premiere Pro interface and workflow is way more superior for video editing.

Premiere Pro is essentially built around its timeline, the region where you cut your video clips and drag and place them into your appropriate sequence. Hollywood filmmakers and professional YouTube content creators are using Premiere Pro to edit high-performing content and award-winning films. The software is very intuitive and easy for beginners to start with.

Are going to work with After Effects to create an income? Or are just going to use it for a hobby? It's crucial to mention that question because Adobe After Effects is not something that is cheaply available. You will be investing much money on the program, and if you are working to use the software, paying a good amount, and earning nothing in return, then you might want to shift to another alternative which would cost you less. For instance, let's assume you are using the application to earn an income, and have a few low-paying clients. In such a situation, you will have to rethink your options of software and analyze whether what you are paying in comparison to what you are getting is enough for you or not. We all are different individuals and have different preferences. Once we can see what is more important to us, or what is our need at this moment, then we will be able to judge the worth of purchasing Adobe After Effects better.

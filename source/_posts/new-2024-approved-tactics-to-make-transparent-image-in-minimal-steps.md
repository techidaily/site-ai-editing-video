![merge audio and video with ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ffmpeg-merge-audio-and-video.JPG)

## Preparation

Are you ready to master the art of merging audio and video? Then let's dive into the world of FFmpeg, a powerful and versatile tool that can help you achieve professional results.

With FFmpeg, you can record, convert, and stream audio and video files in any format, making it a complete and cross-platform solution. It's also a great tool for decoding, encoding, transcoding, muxing, demuxing, streaming, filtering, and playing any media type.

But before we start merging video files using FFmpeg, it's important to understand the basics of container formats and video codecs. These are the building blocks of your videos, and the specific types you're working with will determine the method you'll use to merge them. So, buckle up, and let's get started!

### How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg

Are you looking to add multiple audio tracks to your video? With FFmpeg, you can easily combine video with two audio streams. Whether creating a foreign-language version of your video or adding an alternate audio track, this method will help you achieve professional results. This section will guide you through combining video with two audio streams using FFmpeg's command-line interface. So, let's get started!

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video**

Combining multiple audio tracks into one video can be done easily with FFmpeg's command-line interface. In this example, we will combine two audio tracks into one video so that the voiceover will play over the background music. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step1 **Open** your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your video and audio files are located.

Step2 **Replace** "**video1.mp4**" and "**audio1.mp3**" with the names of your actual video and audio files.

_ffmpeg \\_

_\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

Step3 The **\-c:v copy** flag tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream from the source file without re-encoding it. This helps to speed up the process and avoid quality loss.

_\-c:v copy \\_

_\-filter\_complex " \\_

Step4 The command "**amix=inputs=2:duration=longest**" tells amix to accept 2 inputs (**0:a and 1:a**) and **combine** them into an output stream called **audio\_out**, with the duration of the longest input.

_\[0:a\]\[1:a\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

Step5 **Map** the video stream **(0:v)** and the mixed audio stream **(audio\_out)** into the final output video.

_\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

Step6 The **\-y flag** tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.

_\-y output.mp4_

Once complete, you'll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video Adjusting Volume**

We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.

And here's the step-by-step process:

Step1 **Start** the command by specifying the input files.

_ffmpeg \\_

 _\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** option to specify a filter graph.

 _\-filter\_complex " \\_

 _\[0:a\] volume=0.5 \[music\];_

Step3 **Use** the **amix** filter to take the "**music**" stream and **audio1.mp3** and **mix** them.

 _\[music\]\[1:a\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

 _" \\_

Step4 **Use** the **map** option to **specify** which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.

 _\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

Step5 **Specify** the output file name as "**output.mp4**" and the **\-y flag** to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.

 _\-y output.mp4_

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay**

When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here's how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.

Step1 **Use** the **adelay filter** to add delay to the audio track.

_\[1:a\] adelay=2100|2100 \[voice\];_

Step2 **Mix** the delayed audio track with the original audio track

_\[0:a\]\[voice\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\]_

Step3 **Map** the video and audio tracks to the output file

_\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]"_

Step4 **Use** the **\-y flag** to overwrite the output file

_\-y output.mp4_

The final command would look like this:

_ffmpeg \\_

 _\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

 _\-filter\_complex " \\_

 _\[1:a\] adelay=2100|2100 \[voice\]; \\_

 _\[0:a\]\[voice\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

 _" \\_

 _\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

 _\-y output.mp4_

This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.

Step6 The **\-y flag** tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.

_\-y output.mp4_

Once complete, you'll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video Adjusting Volume**

We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.

And here's the step-by-step process:

Step1 **Start** the command by specifying the input files.

_ffmpeg \\_

 _\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** option to specify a filter graph.

 _\-filter\_complex " \\_

 _\[0:a\] volume=0.5 \[music\];_

Step3 **Use** the **amix** filter to take the "**music**" stream and **audio1.mp3** and **mix** them.

 _\[music\]\[1:a\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

 _" \\_

Step4 **Use** the **map** option to **specify** which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.

 _\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

Step5 **Specify** the output file name as "**output.mp4**" and the **\-y flag** to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.

 _\-y output.mp4_

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay**

When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here's how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.

Step1 **Use** the **adelay filter** to add delay to the audio track.

_\[1:a\] adelay=2100|2100 \[voice\];_

Step2 **Mix** the delayed audio track with the original audio track

_\[0:a\]\[voice\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\]_

Step3 **Map** the video and audio tracks to the output file

_\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]"_

Step4 **Use** the **\-y flag** to overwrite the output file

_\-y output.mp4_

The final command would look like this:

_ffmpeg \\_

 _\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

 _\-filter\_complex " \\_

 _\[1:a\] adelay=2100|2100 \[voice\]; \\_

 _\[0:a\]\[voice\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

 _" \\_

 _\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

 _\-y output.mp4_

This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.

Successful YouTuber

## 1\. Understand 'Success' Means

YouTube's success is based on the premise that all visitors need the same thing. Search, find, and leave as fast as possible. Kind of like a store. But YouTube visitors have much more diverse needs than you might think. Some come to watch short clips of cats doing silly things, others to view TV shows or how to learn an instrument, cooking, maintain a car, and so much more.

The way your success is measured is by the number of viewers you get onto your channel. No matter what kind of content you upload, whether it's about music, education, when you turn viewers into subscribers, dedicated fans, and supporters, that is how you can measure your success and how you can get as many new people through the door and make them stick around because they love what you do and what value you are to them. We are going more in-depth in the other stages of this article about analytics and measurements.

Understand What 'Success' Means

## 2\. Create Your Plan

When it comes to building a successful YouTube channel, consistency is super important. You are more likely to gain success if you have a well-thought-out plan and a strategy for uploading content. Instead of uploading once per month, try once per week if your time schedule allows it so your new viewers know when to expect a new video. Planning is super important because it will allow you to stick to a schedule. If you have a lot of time to create videos, people tend to get used to that schedule. Once you're planning becomes less structured because of lack of time, it can confuse viewers as consistency is important. People do not like change, or it will take time for them to get used to a new schedule, especially if it changes often.

![Creating Your Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-03.jpg)

Create Your Plan

## 3\. Make Your YouTube Videos

After you created your plan, your strategy, and all the preparation, it is time to start filming! We highly recommend working with an upload schedule, so you know which videos to create and when they have to be finished. Try to have a good overall layout and theme for your videos from the start so people know who you are and what you do. Once you started filming you can continue the process and keep producing.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you have less time, you can create more videos in one filming session so you have a bulk library you can release over the period when you don't have time for creating content.

![Making Your YouTube Videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-04.jpg)

Make Your YouTube Videos

It's highly recommended to write down a list of topics for videos so you can have your same recording set ready to go for whenever you start shooting. If you are able to keep a dedicated space to keep your set, that's a huge plus instead of having to tear everything down and setting up again each time you film and it gives your viewers a consistent idea of what they can expect any time new video releases onto your YouTube channel.

## 4\. Use Analytics to Improve

Some marketers could have an unhealthy relationship with analytics. They track too many of the numbers. Maybe we think we can prove any marketing campaign is producing results if there's an eye-catching percentage. But we all know that some metrics are a lot more revealing than other types of statistics.

We have listed 3 important types of metrics you have to study to truly understand your audience.

### ❶ Watch Time

The Watch Time is the total amount of minutes viewers have spent watching your content. It's a key metric because YouTube pushes videos and channels with higher Watch Times in their search results and recommendations section. YouTube does this because the more Watch Time a video has, the more engaging their algorithm knows it is and YouTube like to recommend videos that keep viewers as long as possible on the platform.

![Watch Time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-05.jpg)

Watch Time

In the Watch Time section, you can see the amount of Watch Time your videos have generated. You can also rank each of your videos by Watch Time and group your videos by styles, lengths and themes to determine your most engaging videos.

### ❷ Average view duration

Your Average view duration is the total Watch Time of your video divided by the total number of video playbacks, also including replays. This metric measures your video's ability to engage people. If your video can't engage new visitors, they'll jump off from your video quite fast, leaving you with an unimpressive average view duration. If you create a high-performing video, your Average view duration and total Watch Time will increase over time and boost your search and recommendations rankings by a lot.

![Average view duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-06.jpg)

Average View Duration

### ❸ Audience Retention

Let's talk about Audience Retention. If your video is longer than five minutes, and Audience Retention is more than 50%, you are going in the right direction. A hook is something that grabs a viewer's attention and will result in them staying longer on your video or browsing your other content. We recommend regularly reviewing your videos to ensure you aren't attracting visitors to outdated content. Older videos can turn them away and they may view your YouTube channel as less trustworthy or valuable as a source for the information that they are looking for. Updated videos are high-quality videos.

### 04Rendering Flexibility

You can work with two rendering options, viz., Eevee and Cycles within Blender. Using the Eevee render option, users can render their design models in physical, real time outputs in a quick time span. T5her biggest advantage of this rendering engine happens to be its working speed. While it does not require you wait for tedious rendering durations, you can additionally escape individual frame renders.

The Cycles is a physical, path tracing render engine, using light rays to interpret design looks. Compatible to GPU and CPU rendering, this one is a bit slow, but delivers a much precise image than Eevee.

## Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender

Blender is a top class graphic modulation tool; you can use to play with your editing creativity to your heart’s content, catering to a variety of design requirements, while adhering to a distinguished professional outlook. If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.

When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:

**Transparent BSDF Node**

When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.

Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:

**Step 1:**

Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.

**Step 2:**

To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.

**Step 3:**

Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.

**Step 4:**

Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:

**●** Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Mix Shader output to the Surface input

This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.

**Step 1:**

Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.

**Step 2:**

To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.

**Step 3:**

Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.

**Step 4:**

Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:

**●** Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Mix Shader output to the Surface input

This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.

## How to Shoot Cinematic Footage From a Smartphone

Creating cinematic videos is easy if you have expensive equipment like a film set with high-quality cameras. But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.

You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don't have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.

But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!

## Part 1\. What Is a Cinematic Video?

The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.

Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., **IMAX** cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.

With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.

Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!

## Part 2\. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video

To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:

### 1\. A Gimbal Stabilizer

When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.

If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.

A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the **Q3** Gimbal from **Zhiyun**.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-1.png)

You can also connect the Gimbal from its app. Scroll below to learn more about the app!

**Zhiyun Cami App**

**Zhiyun Q3** stabilizer also connects with the Zhiyun cami app. This app will allow users to access the filming features more intuitively and comprehensively. You can connect your Gimbal with the app via Bluetooth.

![zhiyun cami app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-2.png)

**Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes**

There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:

* **The Locking mode:** This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.
* **The POV mode** will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.

![the different modes of zhiyun q3 stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-3.png)

**Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer**

When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in **flashlight.**

This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal flashlight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-4.png)

You can also turn the flashlight towards yourself if you are recording a Vlog or taking a selfie. The light’s temperature is 4300K, giving a relatively warm light on the subject.

![spectrum of light indicating 4300k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-5.png)

### 2\. A Good Smartphone

Most smartphones these days are equipped with cameras with varying powers of recording. Some smartphone cameras focus on **Mega Pixels,** while others focus on the capture sensor. You need a smartphone camera that balances out all these qualities to record cinematic footage.

The recently released iPhone 14 pro camera is an excellent example of a good quality camera you can use to record cinematic videos.

![smartphone attached to gimbal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-6.png)

### 3\. Video Editing Software

Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.

## Part 3\. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone

You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.

Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.

* The Reveal Movement.
* The 180° Presentation Movement.
* The Following Movement.

First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.

### 1\. The Reveal Movement

This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.

The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.

To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:

* First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the **Gimbal**.
* **Align** your Smartphone camera behind the static object.
* Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.
* Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.

Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in **Locking mode**. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.

![gimbal fixed in locking mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-9.png)

### 2\. The 180° Presentation Movement

The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.

Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.

As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the **POV** **mode** of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.

![gimbal fixed in pov mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-10.png)

Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:

* First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.
* Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.
* When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.
* When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.

![the 180° presentation movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-11.gif)

By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”

### 3\. The Following Movement

You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.

The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.

![drawing a square to focus the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-12.png)

To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:

* When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.
* After that, open the **Cami** app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.
* Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.

![the following movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-13.gif)

This is how you will create the following movement.

## How to Use Color Grading in Final Cut Pro

Have you ever questioned the purpose of those odd video scopes or how to build super grades from the start in Final Cut Pro? In contrast to editing talents, color grading is a technical and difficult ability that takes practice.

In order to help, we decided to compile a thorough beginner's article to color grading in Final Cut Pro.

With that said, let's begin!

## 1\. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro

Color grading may be a tedious and time-consuming operation, therefore it's a skill set that calls for a lot of patience. Some editors won't conduct any color grading or correction beyond the bare minimum. But even mundane-looking film may look remarkable if you know how to give it a dramatic touch.

A more cinematic grade requires a number of procedures, and there is no one method that works for all situations. We'll therefore walk you through the process of creating a cinematic color grade in Final Cut Pro, but depending on your material, you might need to add or omit some phases.

##### Step1Filming

Since the raw video is essential for producing a cinematic image, an outstanding grade begins with the camera.

Use the greatest quality settings your camera offers while recording your video; the more information in your picture, the more you can manipulate it during grading.

While it may seem preferable to shoot with as much color as you can, using a duller color profile is very necessary. Your camera will have color settings, and although the washed-out, drab appearance may not inspire confidence in you, it will offer you a lot more editing possibility.

##### Step2Create a color profile

After importing your film, you may be concerned about the general dull look of your recordings. The reason for that is because you have not yet matched the color profile of your sequence to the one of your camera. To start on this process, it goes as follows.

* Drag your clip onto your timeline and make sure it is selected. Click on the Inspector icon.
* Then click on the Information tab of the clip.
* Navigate all the way down through the options to find the Color LUT option.
* Then choose the Color profile that matches your clip based on the camera it is filmed with.
* You're done!

##### Step3Checking the scopes

The Scopes in Final Cut Pro are panels that display the color information of your shots. They are quite complicated and can be difficult to comprehend if you did not use them ever before. You can activate Video Scopes by clicking View > Show in Viewer > Video Scopes from the View menu. The three components of grading are the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. Your highlights are shown at the top and your shadows are at the bottom in all grading tools and scopes.

## 2\. Include Color Wheels

Now that your setup is complete, you can begin grading your footage. Grading is done in multiple layers stacked on top of each other. It may take multiple levels to create the desired look. Follow the instructions below to modify your settings to match your clip if you want to give your footage a cinematic look.

You may access a wider range of color manipulation tools with the built-in color wheels, exposure adjustments, including isolation of color selection, RGB modifications across tone ranges, and simple masking.

## 3\. Color board

A vertical color spectrum is shown on the Color Board, and it is intersected by a horizontal line that features four nodes. These are the ranges of the footage that are designated as the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, respectively.

Adjusting a node to a new color space has an immediate and noticeable impact on the corresponding section of the image. If you move above the horizontal line, it will increase, and if you go below the line, it will decrease.

You also have control over the Saturation and Exposure settings. These are wonderful to have if you want to increase the contrast in your photographs and make particular colors more vivid or muted.

## 4\. Masks

Using the Shape Masks feature, each of these individual effects can be perfect for particular regions of your footage. In addition, by utilizing a Color Mask, you can alter the appearance of a specific color. It is possible to apply multiple iterations of each color adjustment to a clip and find it listed under the Effect heading.

The order can be changed by dragging and dropping, and either method can be disabled or enabled. Utilizing keyframes allows for the effects of color grading to be specifically timed as well. Last but not least, keep in mind that the quality and color sample depth of the clips determine how much of an overall adjustment you are capable of making to a color.

## 5\. Color Curves

If you are experienced with more advanced picture editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, you will benefit greatly from using color curves. Adjustments can be made independently to both the Luma (the brightest areas) and the primary composite colors (red, blue, and green).

## 6\. Match Colors

Match Color is an additional choice that may be made from the improvement's menu. This function will try to replicate the visual style of one video clip in another. First, choose the clip whose color you want to change, click on that clip that has the desired appearance, and last, choose Match Color.

You will still be able to utilize these settings as shortcuts even after you have gained more experience with manual grading and are comfortable making finer adjustments manually. It is important to keep in mind that while using Final Cut Pro X for color grading, effects can be layered on top of one another.

It's not likely that a single tool or adjustment will solve an issue or produce the desired result; rather, it's more likely that a number of different impacts will be required. In the same way that different visual effects in Final Cut Pro X may be toggled on and off, any layers that you add to a clip can have their visibility controlled from the Inspector window.

## Conclusion

In Final Cut Pro X, you may choose from a wide variety of grading plugins, ranging from more affordable solutions like FCPeffects to more expensive ones like Magic Bullet Looks, which are designed specifically for feature film-style grades.

Additionally, there is a variety of stand-alone applications for color grading, such as DaVinci Resolve and FilmConvert. You might be comfortable with their gear, but you should also know that their professional-grade color package includes some rather complex editing options.

Beginning to experiment with all of Final Cut Pro X's functions and determining which ones are most useful to you is the best method to gain an understanding of the program's color grading capabilities. If you don't currently have a project that requires your attention, you can download stock footage and experiment with it.

##### Step1Upload Your Video Clip

![launch filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step1.JPG)

Launch Filmora and add the video clip that contains the track you want to modify for your project.

##### Step2Find the Silence Detection Feature

![find the silence detection feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step2.jpg)

Remember, you will notice the Silence Detection feature in only audio-enabled video clips. Follow the below steps to detect and remove silent gaps from the clip.

* You need to choose the Silence Detection button from the toolbar.
* You will find the video in the Media window. Right-click your media file and choose Silence Detection.
* After selecting the audio or video clip, go to Tools, followed by Audio. You will find the Silence Detection option. The Silence Detection window will appear once you touch this option.

##### Step3Modify the Settings for the Silence Detection Feature

![silence detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step3.JPG)

You may change the threshold or sensitivity to make it work for you. The sensitivity level determines the size of the pause. Thus, a lower sensitivity level records longer pauses. You can fine-tune three crucial Filmora Silence Detection settings in this step.

First, you should adjust the volume threshold to fix a specific value for silence. This parameter tells the algorithm how loud you want it to be before it becomes annoying. By default, 25% is the volume threshold. It implies that the software will consider segments silent if their volume threshold value is less than 25%.

 Now, you should adjust the Minimum Duration option. It tells Filmora how long a period of quiet or low-volume sound should be. Just 0.5 seconds is the default minimum duration. In other words, for 0.5 seconds to be considered quiet, there must be no sound.

 You can also set the Softening Buffer value. This setting allows you to add a little delay before and after audible parts begin and finish. With 0.1s set as the default, the softening buffer starts to work. It implies that the beginning and end of the audible parts may each have their own 0.1-second buffering time.

##### Step4Eliminate Any Found Silences

![choose analyze option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step4.jpg)

Hit the "Analyze" button after you're happy with the settings. The Filmora will detect and remove the silent areas in your audio track.

The software also highlights segments in two different colors. Seen in black are the portions that do not contain any sound. The highlighted sections indicate the audible portions.

##### Step5Evaluate Your Work and Adjust

![evaluate your work and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step5.JPG)

You can make sure the video segments move without a hitch. Thus, listen to the modified audio track again. You can adjust the clips in the timeline to customize the edit directly if necessary.

Of course, you also have the option to tweak the three audio settings listed in step 3\. Next, choose Restart to remove the silent segments from your video.

##### Step6Export Your Video Clip

![export video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step6.jpg)

![silence detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step3.JPG)

You may change the threshold or sensitivity to make it work for you. The sensitivity level determines the size of the pause. Thus, a lower sensitivity level records longer pauses. You can fine-tune three crucial Filmora Silence Detection settings in this step.

First, you should adjust the volume threshold to fix a specific value for silence. This parameter tells the algorithm how loud you want it to be before it becomes annoying. By default, 25% is the volume threshold. It implies that the software will consider segments silent if their volume threshold value is less than 25%.

 Now, you should adjust the Minimum Duration option. It tells Filmora how long a period of quiet or low-volume sound should be. Just 0.5 seconds is the default minimum duration. In other words, for 0.5 seconds to be considered quiet, there must be no sound.

 You can also set the Softening Buffer value. This setting allows you to add a little delay before and after audible parts begin and finish. With 0.1s set as the default, the softening buffer starts to work. It implies that the beginning and end of the audible parts may each have their own 0.1-second buffering time.

##### Step4Eliminate Any Found Silences

![choose analyze option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step4.jpg)

Hit the "Analyze" button after you're happy with the settings. The Filmora will detect and remove the silent areas in your audio track.

The software also highlights segments in two different colors. Seen in black are the portions that do not contain any sound. The highlighted sections indicate the audible portions.

##### Step5Evaluate Your Work and Adjust

![evaluate your work and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step5.JPG)

You can make sure the video segments move without a hitch. Thus, listen to the modified audio track again. You can adjust the clips in the timeline to customize the edit directly if necessary.

Of course, you also have the option to tweak the three audio settings listed in step 3\. Next, choose Restart to remove the silent segments from your video.

##### Step6Export Your Video Clip

![export video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step6.jpg)

You've almost finished fine-tuning your movie using Filmora's Silence Detection tool. Now, you may export the final video to the timeline. Enjoy a professionally upgraded audio component inside your video.

## Step by Step to Cut Videos in Adobe Premiere Pro

Video editing is an essential skill in a world that has a growing focus on creative fields. And if you work with videos, knowing which clips to use and where to cut is essential in conveying your story and increasing its impact. So, if you are a beginner and want to familiarise yourself with steps and terms used in video editing, in this article, we will go through the steps you will need to cut your video file in Adobe Premiere Pro and Wondershare Filmora.

_This guide uses Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 and Wondershare Filmora X._

## How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Once you have Adobe Premiere Pro open on your computer, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Create a new project in Premiere Pro.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-1.jpeg)

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg)

You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create **Bins**, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg)

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an **In Point**and an **Out Point.** These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.

_We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below._

1. Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons \[marked in Yellow\] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.
1. You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.

## An alternative way to cut video with Wondershare Filmora

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , the steps to cut a video are simplified and don’t require as many steps as seen earlier. Opening the application throws you straight into a project, and following this, you can import a video file and begin editing. From the process you will learn below, it is easy to assume that Wondershare Filmora is more convenient for beginners and provides software features that match paid professional software.

Once you have the editing software open, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a video file by clicking on the import window.

The default project setting for Filmora X is 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. Users can change this to match their video file by going into Project Settings under the File tab or by accepting the automatic prompt that appears when dragging the video file onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-8.jpeg)

**Note:** If you have a PC with weak hardware, Wondershare Filmora gives you the option to create Video Proxies that will reduce the load on your computer by creating smaller clips that are lower in size, resulting in a smoother and faster experience. You can also do this in Premiere Pro, but Filmora does it for you automatically once given permission.

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the Timeline to begin previewing it in the Playback Window and commence editing operations.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-9.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Locate where you want to cut in the video file and click on the orange scissors option to split the video file.

**Tip:** You can also use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B) to cut without using a mouse click, in case you make use of a trackpad while editing.

The Bottom Line

As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

## Part 3\. Time-lapse to Normal Video Online

There are situations where users don't want to go installing extra applications when it comes to executing a task. And if you happen to be such a user who wants to convert your timelapse into a beautiful video, then you can do it online for free. Veed.io is an online platform that allows users to upload and convert time-lapse to normal video online easily.

First, open your browser and enter "veed.io" i.e. “time-lapse to normal video converter online” in your search box. Then the first result that will be shown will be from its official website. Click on that and you will be directed to the veed.io online interface.

The interface will have different options like "Sign Up, "Try Sample" etc. From the available options, click on "Upload Your Video". This will allow you to edit your videos without even creating an account.

Then the interface will direct you to the video creation page. Here you will see a bunch of predefined templates to make videos. Click on the "Create Template" option and the interface will have a "Upload Your Media" box on the screen. Here you can click on it and select your timelapse file or drag and drop it from any source.

After the video is added to the veed.io page, it will take some time to upload it to the project menu. You can add multiple files by clicking on the "Add" option available on the screen. After a short while, you will see the video preview on the screen along with a timeline of the video.

![preview video speed controller](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-video-speed-controller.jpg)

Click on the timeline feature and there will be different tools from veed.io available at the bottom of the interface. Select the speedometer type icon on the screen and this will give you access to control the playback speed of timelapse.

You can drag the cursor from 1X to any desired speed here. Just click on the drag button and lower the speed below 1X to a desirable speed of your choice. In the preview window, check how the video is being rendered.

When you are satisfied with the changes and the video speed seems normal to you, go to the top right corner of the screen and click on the "Export" option. This will ask you to set your preferences for different video settings. Change them according to your requirement and then the video will be downloaded to your device.

**Wondershare Filmora** Easily convert time-lapse video to normal speed on PC and Mac.

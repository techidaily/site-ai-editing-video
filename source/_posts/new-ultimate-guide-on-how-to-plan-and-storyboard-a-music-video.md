## Ultimate Guide on How to Plan and Storyboard a Music Video

Do you want to bring your music to life on the big screen? Do you want to create something visually striking? Making a music video seems like a big task. Sometimes, the artist you're working with might not have a clear idea for their music video. It's your job to help guide the creative process.

But don't worry! This guide is going to make it easy for you to plan and storyboard your music video step by step with the help of [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). So let's get started and make an amazing music video together!

## Plan and develop initial ideas

The first and essential step in creating a music video is planning. This is where you will lay the foundation of your music video. You need to figure out what your video is about and what you want to convey to the audience. It involves a concept or theme for the video, research, and reference material. You can also explore different ideas to make your video unique and engaging.

![graphical text of initial ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-initial-ideas.jpg)

##### Step1Research and gather information

You can begin by researching and gathering information from other music videos. This will help you to know what has been done before and what is currently popular. You can also figure out how you can do it differently.

##### Step2Brainstorm and concept development

Once you understand the current trends and styles in the music video. It's time to start brainstorming ideas. You can do it alone or with the help of your team. But remember that you have to think out of the box to make it creative.

##### Step3Consider the lyrics and message

In the planning stage, it is also important to consider the lyrics and message of the song. It would be best if you plan according to the feel and vibe of the song. It will help you to create a concept tied to the song and will help enhance its meaning.

##### Step4Experiment and find the right direction

Once you have a general concept, it's time to develop it further. You can do it by creating rough sketches or storyboards. You can also film test footage to see how the concept will look on screen.

##### Step5Effort and attention to detail

Remember, this step is the foundation of your music video. So, take your time and don't rush through it. By putting in effort and attention to detail, you'll be able to create a visually stunning and closely tied to the song's music video.

## Choose a style for your music video

While creating ideas for the music video, it's also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:

![types of music video style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/types-of-music-video-style.jpg)

### 1.Performance-style music video

If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.

### 2.Narrative-style music video

A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.

You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.

Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.

![treatment of the plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/treatment-of-the-plan.jpg)

If the artist approves the direction of the video, it's time to move on to storyboarding!

## Storyboard your music video

Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding! It allows you to break down your music video visually and highlight key visual moments. It can save time and money and convey a clear idea to the team. You can do this on paper, a computer, or a tablet, whatever works best for you.

## How to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix

Netflix is the most popular streaming service in the world. It offers loads of movies and series that you can watch on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Over the years, Netflix has become a one-stop destination for watching movies and TV shows in different languages.

While the user base of Netflix is quite diverse, the platform offers subtitles in limited languages for most movies and series. Suppose you want to view a Korean Drama on Netflix with French subtitles. However, you found that French subtitles are unavailable for that Korean Drama. In such a case, you might wonder if adding custom subtitles to Netflix is possible.

Well, you can add subtitles to Netflix, and there are two different methods to do the same. This guide will help you learn both methods available for adding custom subtitles to Netflix. So, let's get started!

## Method 1\. Upload Your Custom Subtitle to Netflix

Before proceeding with this method, you must remember that it only works if you are a Netflix Premium user. Now, let's discuss how to add subtitles to Netflix with this method.

### Key Steps to Follow

Below are the steps for adding custom subtitles to Netflix.

Step 1 First of all, you need to install and add [Language Learning with Netflix & YouTube™](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/bekopgepchoeepdmokgkpkfhegkeohbl?hl=en-US) extension to your web browser (Chrome or Edge).

Step 2 Make sure the extension is activated.

Step 3 Download the .srt file that contains the subtitles in your preferred language for a particular movie or TV show.

Step 4 Open Netflix on a Chrome or Edge browser and sign into your account.

Step 5 Play the movie or TV show for which you have downloaded the subtitles.

Step 6 Within the Netflix player, you will see a settings icon left to the **Subtitles** icon. Click on it.

Step 7 Among the various setting options, you need to choose the screen and find the one with the label "Lower Subtitles (Mother Language)". You need to click on its field and select the "Upload Subtitle" option.

Step 8 You will see a pop-up window at the top of the screen where you need to click the "Choose File" button.

Step 9 You then need to navigate to the directory on your computer where you have downloaded the subtitles file, select it, and click the "Open" button.

Step 10 Click the "Okay" button to upload the subtitles to Netflix.

Step 11 Close the settings window and play the video. You can view the uploaded subtitles at the bottom of the player.

## Method 2\. Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Extensions

If you're not a Netflix Premium user, you can still add subtitles to Netflix with the help of certain browser extensions. We'll list them down and discuss the steps for using one of them; the basic steps for using all such extensions are pretty much the same.

### 1\. Substital

**Supported web browsers:** [C](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en)[hrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/substital/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/substital-add-subtitles-/dkkffblkjnedaekodhiblomkicklmjnp?source=sfwOPERA)

Substital is among the most popular extensions that allow you to add subtitles to several online on-demand video streaming platforms, including Netflix. It has more than 100K users on the Chome Web Store.

**Key Features**

* Offers a built-in subtitles search feature.
* Supports .srt files and .zip files containing subtitles in the .srt format.

Step 1 The first thing you need to do is to download and install the Substital extension on your browser.

Step 2 Open Netflix on the same browser and log in to your account.

Step 3 Play the movie or episode from a TV series for which you want to add custom subtitles.

Step 4 Download the subtitles file for the same movie or episode in your preferred language from the web.

Step 5 Now open the extensions menu in your browser and click on the Substital icon.

Step 6 You will see the name of the movie or TV show that you are watching on Netflix. Click on it.

Step 7 In this step, you need to drag and drop the subtitle file from your system (that you downloaded earlier) to the browser window.

Step 8 Finally, you can notice that the subtitles are loaded in the Netflix player.

### 2\. Super Netflix

**Web browsers:** [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-netflix/iakpdiefpdniabbekcbofaanjcpjkloe)

Super Netflix is yet another reliable extension to add subtitles to Netflix. Apart from adding custom subtitles, this extension allows you to change the video playback speed. Like Substital, the Super Netflix extension on Chrome Web Store also has 100K+ users.

**Key Features**

* It can help you avoid spoilers by blurring images and episode descriptions.

Unlike the other two extensions mentioned above, Netflix SubStyler only allows you to change the styling of subtitles on Netflix. However, the thing that makes this extension worthy of your attention is that it comes loaded with several customization options.

**Key Features**

* You can choose a custom text color for the subtitles either with the help of an in-built color picker or by entering the RGB value of the color.
* The extension lets you add text outlines and change the size of the text.
* You can even add a text background and change its color and opacity.

## Part 1: Finding the Best Resolution for DaVinci Resolve Slow Playback Issue

As Highlighted, DaVinci Resolve is a good video editor for all kinds of use cases. Although it's a powerful tool, it still shows some errors like choppy and slow playback. Modern problems require modern solutions. Thus, read the given fixes to make **DaVinci Resolve faster playback.** All the methods are easy and helpful for a smooth playback experience on Windows and macOS.

* [Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution](#davinci1)
* [Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution](#davinci2)
* [Solution 3: Enable Render Cache](#davinci3)
* [Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature](#davinci4)
* [Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files](#davinci5)
* [Solution 6: Disable Color Grades](#davinci6)

### Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution

In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the "Playback" menu from the top. Then, select "Timeline Proxy Resolution" and pick one either "Half" or "Quarter" options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.

![lower playback resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

### Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on "OK."

![change timeline resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-2.jpg)

### Solution 3: Enable Render Cache

It’s another solution to fix the **DaVinci resolve slow playback**. Render cache is a file that stores the rendered frames and makes the rendering faster. Start by hitting the “Playback” option and choose “Render Cache.” Then, you’ll see 3 options: None, Smart, and User. You should select "Smart" and let DaVinci Resolve pick one clip to be cached.

![enable render cache slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

### Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature

Every change you make gets saved with the Live Save option in DaVinci Resolve. If your remote drive is linked, this feature can drag the playback speed down. You can disable it for a **DaVinci resolve faster playback**.

Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.

![disable live save feature slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

### Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files

Another solution is to use proxy media during the project editing. Proxy files are small copy files transcoded from a larger, original video file. Get the proxy file to increase the playback and go to your "Media Pool" in DaVinci Resolve. Right-click on the intended file and choose "Generate Proxy Media" from the list.

![use proxy files slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-5.jpg)

## Part 1: Finding the Best Resolution for DaVinci Resolve Slow Playback Issue

As Highlighted, DaVinci Resolve is a good video editor for all kinds of use cases. Although it's a powerful tool, it still shows some errors like choppy and slow playback. Modern problems require modern solutions. Thus, read the given fixes to make **DaVinci Resolve faster playback.** All the methods are easy and helpful for a smooth playback experience on Windows and macOS.

* [Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution](#davinci1)
* [Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution](#davinci2)
* [Solution 3: Enable Render Cache](#davinci3)
* [Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature](#davinci4)
* [Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files](#davinci5)
* [Solution 6: Disable Color Grades](#davinci6)

### Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution

In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the "Playback" menu from the top. Then, select "Timeline Proxy Resolution" and pick one either "Half" or "Quarter" options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.

![lower playback resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

### Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on "OK."

Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.

## [Tutorial] How To Add Motion Blur in Blender?

Motion blur effect, as a terminology, holds great significance in multiple industrial uses. From filmmaking to basic photography, the motion blur effect is consumed as a reality-setting standard, which defines its significance. Many platforms are providing this effect to enhance the creativity of their users. Blender is also known among these software providing such services while designing animations.

We will target a comprehensive guide on **adding motion blur in Blender** using the right way. Therefore, if you seek the appropriate way of adding motion blur in Blender, the following description is for you.

## Part 1: What is Blender?

As we start our discussion, we will review [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a free and open-source software. Following this, we will continue realizing the benefits of adding motion blur through Blender:

### Introduction to Blender

For those unaware of Blender, it is an open-source, free creativity software. You can find it as the perfect designing platform for your 3D content. This software has made itself accessible to the market with ease. This has made it quite famous among professionals, and is recommended for its high-quality, feature-rich design. From modeling to sculpting, Blender provides some great options to work with.

If you are up for editing some videos through Blender, it offers a great course of features, including motion blur. This **Blender motion blur tutorial** intends to bring you a similar insight into this great software. This will help you know the procedure of executing such facets to perfection.

![blender interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-1.jpg)

### Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect

There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:

**· Perfect For Idolizing Speed**

The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.

**· Resolves Flickering**

Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.

**· Attenuates Real-Effect**

One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.

## Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?

As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on **how to add motion blur in Blender**:

Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the "Render Properties." Look to enable "Motion Blur" from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.

![enable the motion blur option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg)

Step2 Start by setting its "Position" in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use "Center on Frame." If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the "Shutter" value or vice versa.

![adjust the shutter value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg)

Step3 Following this, define the "Background Separation" according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the "Max Blur" pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.

![set background separation and max blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg)

Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.

![set the value for steps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-5.jpg)

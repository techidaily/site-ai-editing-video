AR or **Augmented Reality** and VR or Virtual Reality are quite a common discussion in the world of technology. Similarly, the technology-driven workspaces demand a seamless workspace collaboration post-pandemic. People are used to working from home and the workspace culture is changing rapidly due to such habits. 59% of the US workers want to continue WFH according to a study by TalentLyft. To cut the cost of daily travel and dedicate more quality time to work, employees are prioritizing online offices. On the other hand, employers are willing to save office space and other expenses with such a professional routine. That’s where the idea of augmented reality video conferencing is hitting to keep the collaboration between workers alive for a synchronized workflow.

## Part 1 What is Augmented Reality Conferencing and What's VR Video Streaming Workflow

Before jumping to the application of AR and VR, it’s important to clarify the concept of the two different technologies. While AR is an enhanced version of the real world, VR is totally virtual. As a basic concept, note that, augmented reality is an arrangement of the user’s real-world view whereas virtual reality is totally an illusion based on a video. AR can be accessed from a phone to set the camera with a view and a virtual arrangement would be present within it. For example, if there’s a room in the real world, with an **AR video conference**, people can be adjusted virtually.

![ar in conference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/is-augmented-reality-conferencing-the-future-of-workplace-collaboration-2.jpg)

Virtual reality, as the name suggests, is totally in control of the system. With goggles or headsets, one can view computer-generated video with 360 degrees of technical effects to be seemed as real. This technology is mainly applicable for a video currently and there’re more scopes to experiment further.

![vr video streaming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/is-augmented-reality-conferencing-the-future-of-workplace-collaboration-3.jpg)

Here comes the question, how these technologies can be merged with a permanent business structure that can be as effective as the older system, and there’s scope for even better results? Well, according to a study by FinancesOnline, 72% of the US customers find AR for better collaboration and 69% think it increases the efficiency in the workspace. Also, 49% of the IT experts believe that AR can access real-time information sooner.

The key idea behind **augmented reality conferencing** is to omit the parameters like distance, time, and space expenses and motivate positive collaboration in business workflow. There are multiple advantages of this technology for both employees and employers. As people are getting accustomed to the virtual setting in any professional or personal work from home, the plan to shift to a semi-virtual or virtual office structure is not vague now. In fact, this adaptation might take place sooner than expected as a long-term effect of the pandemic.

**How** augmented reality conferencing **and virtual reality video streaming will be working?**

AR and VR can be implemented through different technologies and hardware devices. As a result, employees can attend a meeting from home, just with a mobile application that enables the office structure in the room. Or, 2-3 members can be present physically in a meeting room while others are joining from remote places through VR. A 3D video streaming would overshadow the physical absence of the teammates. At the same time, the resources can be shared in no time for reference and transparent communication.

So, how exactly a business can be affected by **augmented reality video conferencing** on a large scale? Here’s a keen observation from both perspectives.

## Part 2 Pros and Cons of AR and VR Conferencing

Virtual reality, as the name suggests, is totally in control of the system. With goggles or headsets, one can view computer-generated video with 360 degrees of technical effects to be seemed as real. This technology is mainly applicable for a video currently and there’re more scopes to experiment further.

![vr video streaming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/is-augmented-reality-conferencing-the-future-of-workplace-collaboration-3.jpg)

Here comes the question, how these technologies can be merged with a permanent business structure that can be as effective as the older system, and there’s scope for even better results? Well, according to a study by FinancesOnline, 72% of the US customers find AR for better collaboration and 69% think it increases the efficiency in the workspace. Also, 49% of the IT experts believe that AR can access real-time information sooner.

The key idea behind **augmented reality conferencing** is to omit the parameters like distance, time, and space expenses and motivate positive collaboration in business workflow. There are multiple advantages of this technology for both employees and employers. As people are getting accustomed to the virtual setting in any professional or personal work from home, the plan to shift to a semi-virtual or virtual office structure is not vague now. In fact, this adaptation might take place sooner than expected as a long-term effect of the pandemic.

**How** augmented reality conferencing **and virtual reality video streaming will be working?**

AR and VR can be implemented through different technologies and hardware devices. As a result, employees can attend a meeting from home, just with a mobile application that enables the office structure in the room. Or, 2-3 members can be present physically in a meeting room while others are joining from remote places through VR. A 3D video streaming would overshadow the physical absence of the teammates. At the same time, the resources can be shared in no time for reference and transparent communication.

So, how exactly a business can be affected by **augmented reality video conferencing** on a large scale? Here’s a keen observation from both perspectives.

## Part 2 Pros and Cons of AR and VR Conferencing

## Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage

The secret to designing an eye-catching **lightroom collage** is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.

**Balance**

Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.

**Alignment**

Don't underestimate the importance of alignment in **Lightroom collage**. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.

Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:

**●** Realistic pictures should be put together.

**●** Unrelatable images should be separated.

Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.

**Theme**

The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it's not as measurable as others.

## How to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

With the vast number of devices available in the market today, storing data and video files has become difficult. Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.

In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you'll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video's resolution, let's look into what a video resolution is!

## Part 1\. What Is a Video Resolution?

A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of **tiny pixels** and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.

Video resolution is rendered in a **vertical** and **horizontal** orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., **480p**, **720p**, **1080p,** etc.

In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a **720p** video is **1280 x 720,** and a **1080p** video is a **1920 x 1080** resolution.

![a video resolution dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-1.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.

![difference between a 4k and 8k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-6.png)

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

##### Step4 Export Your Video

You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.

**Video Format Resolution**

Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include **MP4**, **WMV**, **F4V**, **MOV**, **TS**, **3GP**, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:

Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.

**Default Resolution Settings**

Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., **TS** has a default **1080p** resolution.

**Note:** Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to **1080p**. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a **3GP** format, which is set to **352 x 488** by default.

**Customize the Resolution**

But if you don't find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:

* In the preset tab, go to > **settings**.
* In the video tab, click on the **resolution**.
* In the **drop-down** menu, select the resolution that you desire.

You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:

* In the **drop-down** menu, click on **Custom**.
* Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.

## Make A Countdown Video

Have you ever wanted to use Adobe After Effects to recreate a countdown timer for a rocket launch or simply create a suspenseful moment in a video by displaying how the time runs out? This tutorial will show you how. It is imperative that you become familiar with the process of creating a countdown in After Effects.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to use Adobe After Effects to put together a countdown video. This procedure is a straightforward one, and it will handle expressions as well as plugins. Stay here and read on to find out more about the various methods in which we might accomplish this goal!

Let's begin!

## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

![create new text countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-new-text-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

![customize timecode countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-timecode-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.

Go to “Transform Option” and decrease the scale just a little bit. Then increase the “Scale Height” just a little.

Step4The next step is to add color to the scene. To do that, right-click on the layer and choose “New > Solid.” Select the gold color and click “OK.” Do the same with the second layer.

Step5Now you want to blend both colors by choosing a blending mode. Hold the “Shift” key and “hyphen” or “=” sign on the keyboard and choose “Overlay.”

Step6To make the color stronger, go to “Layer > Solid Settings” and choose a color.

Step7Go back to “Comp 3.” Right-click on it and select “New > Light” to add a new point of light.

Step8Go back to the project panel to click on “Comp 4” to add the environment. Right-click on the Comp 4 layer and make it an environment layer.

Step9In the options that appear, set “Appears in Reflections” to “Only” and you can then increase and decrease the color saturation until you have the desired result.

## Alternative Way to Create Video Gold

Adobe After Effects is a very good video editor, but one of the things that can make it inaccessible to many users is that it can be very difficult to use. Thankfully, there is another very effective video editor that you can use to create gold text that is much easier to use.

This is the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), one of the best video editors in the market. Before we look at how you can use Filmora to create the perfect gold metal texture on your text, let's first look at some of its main features;

* You can use Filmora to edit videos at a very high resolution including 4K videos
* It can be used to remove the background and noise from the video very easily
* You can edit both video and audio in the same project
* Up to 5 text tracks and 10 music tracks can be added to the same timeline and the same project
* It is very easy to use with a simple and intuitive user interface

Here's how to use Filmora to create a gold metal texture for your text;

##### Step1Install Wondershare Filmora on your Computer

Download the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) setup file to your computer and double-click on it to start installing the program to your computer.

Open the program once the installation is complete.

##### Step2Create a New Project

If you are starting from the beginning, you may need to create a new project.

To do that, click on “File > New Project” in the menu bar to start a new project.

If there was a project that you were already working on, click on “Open Project” on the main window and then click “File > Open Project” or “File > Open Recent” in the menu bar.

##### Step3Add A Title to the Timeline

To add a gold texture effect to a title on your video, we will first of all need to add a title to the project.

To do that, go click on the “Titles” tab at the top and drag one of the default titles to the timeline.

Once it is in the timeline, double-click on the title and edit it. Type in anything you want to appear in the title.

![add title to timeline gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-title-to-timeline-gold-effect.jpg)

Move the title to the second track in the timeline as you get ready to begin adding the colors.

##### Step4Start Adding Colors

Go to “Media” at the top and click on “Sample Colors.” Drag the black color image to the track directly below the title timeline.

![start adding colors gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/start-adding-colors-gold-effect.jpg)

Then take a snapshot of this newly created image by clicking on the “camera” icon next to the playhead.

Change the Font of the Title to something else more elegant like “Montez” and take another snapshot by clicking on the same camera icon.

##### Step5Add the Gold Effect

Delete everything from the timeline. Don't worry you took a photo of all the text layers and the effects added to each.

You will then need to find an image of a gold background. You can find these on any good background image site. Download a good clear image and upload it into Filmora.

Now drag and drop the gold background image to the second track in the timeline. Double click on the background image.

Select “Compositing” and then in the “Blending Mode” drop-down menu, choose “Darken.” Click OK.”

## Step by Step to Cut a Video in QuickTime

Filming a video is fun and editing is more interesting and entertaining. Today, everyone is making videos and there are tons of videos on the internet. Editing videos is required to make the video stand out and retain the audience. Video trimming helps you cut out the unwanted part of the video and leave the desired portion of the viewers.

**Cutting a video means your video starts quickly and you don’t lose your audience’s attention**.

The first ten seconds of the video are very important when deciding whether to stay or move on to the next video.

## **How to cut a video in QuickTime**

Quicktime is an authentic application developed by Apple in 1991\. It allows the users to edit, record, play, and share videos and pictures. If some editing software confuses you, **QuickTime** is just for you.

You need to download the application and here are all the features you can enjoy. It is compatible with all versions of windows whereas, if you are a Mac user it is already installed in your system.

Cutting a video is one of the basic but useful functions of QuickTime. It requires a few simple steps and some features related to cutting, splitting, and trimming a video.

Let’s start…

### **1\.** **Cutting/splitting a video**

Cutting a video means splitting some parts of the video to edit and rearrange the clips to make a new video. Mostly, it is used where you want to edit all clips of the video differently. It is also needed as it allows you to focus on your message and delete the portion not required and make the video large. You can remove the extra fat from the video to give clarity, direction, and hope. You can convey your message in a clear and concise way.

These steps should be followed to cut/split the video in minutes.

* In the **QuickTime player**, open the desired video.
* Select **show clips** from the **view** on the menu bar.
* Move the red marker from right to left to select the desired portion.
* Hit **split clip** from the **edit**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-1.png)

* A yellow rectangular bar appears over the edges of your video.
* You can cut the desired portion and make editing as you like.
* Repeat the sequence until you are done.
* Press the **done**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-2.png)

Cutting the video by splitting is used when you have a long video and you can easily edit them by splitting them into two parts.

### **2\.** **Trimming a video**

If you are cutting some parts at the beginning and the end of the video, it is called trimming a video. You can say it as removing unnecessary preparation scenes. Normally, professionals start their cameras before the film scene to ensure not to miss any part of the video. Here’s, how to trim video in the QuickTime player.

Let’s dive in…

* Launch **QuickTime**
* Select your **video** from the system.
* Select **edit** from the top menu.
* Select the **trim** or **command T**, or you can select the **hold** option from the drop-down list.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-3.png)

* A **yellow trimming bar** will appear over the edges of your video.
* Remove the unwanted area by moving from the right or left **trim edges** also called **handles**.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-4.png)

Everything inside the **yellow bars** will remain. You can preview your video anytime during the editing process.

* Hit the **trim** from the bottom right corner.
* Select save from the file on the top menu bar.

Trimming is critical because it is the time to convince the viewers to stick around and stay with your video.

While the visual elements count to be the major attractions of a slideshow presentation, subtle background music can work to bind the audience with the rhythm and flow of the presentation. Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:

### 01Select a Royalty Free Music Plan

Adding suitable background music can uplift the appeal of your slideshow presentation to greater extents. While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.

However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.

### 02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices

When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.

You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.

![Recommended Audio Choices](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-10.JPG)

### 03Synchronize the Slideshow Music and the Contents

The credibility of your background audio lies in adding additional spark and integrity to the stills and videos of the presentation. When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.

Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.

If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.

![Selecting the Appropriate Background Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-11.JPG)

### 04Curate and Test

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.

Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.

While the visual elements count to be the major attractions of a slideshow presentation, subtle background music can work to bind the audience with the rhythm and flow of the presentation. Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:

### 01Select a Royalty Free Music Plan

Adding suitable background music can uplift the appeal of your slideshow presentation to greater extents. While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.

However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.

### 02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices

When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.

You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.

![Recommended Audio Choices](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-10.JPG)

### 03Synchronize the Slideshow Music and the Contents

The credibility of your background audio lies in adding additional spark and integrity to the stills and videos of the presentation. When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.

Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.

If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.

![Selecting the Appropriate Background Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-11.JPG)

### 04Curate and Test

When you are done with creating the perfect soundtrack for your presentation with the choicest of music, proceed to narrow down your list to a finer selection via curating the elements of the soundtrack. All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.

Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.

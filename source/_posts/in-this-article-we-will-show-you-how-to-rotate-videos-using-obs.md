## Steps to Edit Facebook Video Ads for E-commerce Business

##### Step1Prepare your script for Video Editing

To make your Facebook video ad, you need to have a clear idea of what you want to say in the video. This can be done by creating a script for your video. Once you have a script, you can start planning out your video and editing it in Filmora.

##### Step2Save your video materials

To gather all photos and video materials, you can either use your own personal footage or find stock images and videos online. Once you have all the desired media, save them to a designated folder on your computer so you can easily access them while editing in Filmora.

##### Step3Open Filmora and click on "Create a New Project."

Now that you have your content ready, open Filmora and click on "Create a New Project." This will create a new project file for you to start editing in.

##### Step4Select the right Project Aspect Ratio

It is important to use the correct project aspect ratio when creating a Facebook video ad because if you don't, your video may not be in the correct format when it is uploaded to Facebook. When selecting the project aspect ratio, make sure to choose Widescreen (16:9) or Instagram (1:10) to ensure that your video is in the correct format.

##### Step5Import your media files into Filmora

Once you have decided on the project aspect ratio, you can start importing your video and photo files. To do this, go to the "Media Library" and click on "Import Media Files." Find the folder where you saved your content and select all of the files that you want to use. Then, click "Open" to import the files into Filmora.

##### Step6Set the background color for your Facebook Video Ads

Now that you have all of your content imported into Filmora, you can start editing it. One thing you may want to do is set the background color for your video. To do this, go to the "Media" tab and click on the "Sample Color" section. Then, select the desired color for your background. Make sure to use your branding color palette.

This will help to grab the viewer's attention and explain what your video is about. To do this, go to the "Titler" tab and select the "Titles" option. Then, click on the "Text" tab and type in your headline. You can also add some text to the video by going to the "Text" tab and clicking on the "Add Text" option.

##### Step8Convert your script into a voice-over narrator

By using text to voice feature, you can generate voice-over that will help you create a more professional video. To do this, go to the "Text" tab and click on the "Add Text" option. Then, type in your script. Once you have finished typing, click on the "Text-ti-Voice Over" button and select the desired language.

## How to Add Echo Effect to Video

If you are alone in a large empty room and you speak something, your words get echoed across the room. It will seem as if you are speaking the same words multiple times but with less volume every single time. When you have a video where you are reading out poems or giving an important message, adding an echo effect to the video makes the audio impactful and engaging.

You will need a video editor where you can add echo effect to video in simple steps. Not many video editors are available where you can add the echo effect instantly from the available sound effects and presets. That is why we have handpicked the best video editors for Windows PC and Mac users. You can also add echo effect to video online from any device directly from your web browser.

## Part 1\. How to Add Echo Effect to Video Online

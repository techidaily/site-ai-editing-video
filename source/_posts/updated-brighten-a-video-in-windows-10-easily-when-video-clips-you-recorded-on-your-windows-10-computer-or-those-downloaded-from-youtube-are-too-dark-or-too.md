## Does Windows 10 have built-in video editing software?

The answer is yes. Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn't work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.

You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You'll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.

Think of a video that looks great when spliced together into two consecutive videos. This can be a similar color palette, an event or travel video, or a video of the same person. When

videos are uploaded, the video preview shows how they look combined. Kapwing highlights each scene with a purple box during playback.

Drag both ends of the layer to change the timing of the start and end of the clip, or click the timing and use the arrow keys to make fine adjustments.

Besides trimming, you can look at other edits. To remove a section or add a clip in the center, use the split tool above the timeline or type "s" on your keyboard and use the shortcut.

Next, delete the layers you no longer need, drag the clips to combine them, and display them side by side on the timeline.

 creators have more control over the montage by editing the scene in Studio. In Studio, you can add music to your montage,

 insert title slides, attach endings, watermark corners, and animate.

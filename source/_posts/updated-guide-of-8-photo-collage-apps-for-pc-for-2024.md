## Track Mattes: The Ultimate Guide For After Effects

Are you wondering what **Track Mattes** is? In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.

For After Effects editors, **Track Mattes** can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.

In this article, we'll explore everything you need to know about **Track Mattes**. We'll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.

1. [Alpha Matte](#part4-1)
2. [Alpha Inverted Matte](#part4-2)
3. [Luma Matte](#part4-3)
4. [Luma Inverted Matte](#part4-4)
5. [Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel](#part4-5)

## Part 1\. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?

A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a "hole" in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.

You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.

Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.

Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.

## Part 2\. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte

In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.

Here're some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:

1. A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.
2. A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.

## Part 3\. Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects

Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the **Transfer Control Pane** button on the bottom-left of the timeline.

![track matte in the timeline window of the after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/track-matter-in-the-timeline-window-of-the-after-effects.png)

If you are still unable to find the Track Matte option, press the **F1 key** or do the following steps in sequence:

1. Right-click on the area above your layers and select **"Columns."**
2. Scroll down and click the **"Modes"** option to enable it.

![finding the track matte option in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/finding-the-track-matte-option-in-after-effects.png)

1. **Track Matte mode, Preserve Underlying Transparency,** and **Blending Modes** will be available now.

Under Track Matte's drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma. We'll discuss these options in detail in the next section.

## Part 4\. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects

After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:

**Alpha:** This Track Matte type uses the layer's Alpha channel to determine the layer's opacity.

**Luma:** This Track Matte type uses the top layer's brightness to mask the bottom layer.

![the four track matte options in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png)

Let's find out the functions of each option one by one:

### Alpha Matte

Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.

### Alpha Inverted Matte

The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.

### Luma Matte

Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.

### Luma Inverted Matte

Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.

### Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel

When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.

Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.

![alpha channel in track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/alpha-channel-in-track-matte.png)

On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.

## Introduction

It will be much fun if you get to assort most of your GIF files and turn them into full-length streaming videos. However, many conversion websites and software on the internet offer you the facility to **convert GIF to AVI** file format with ease of use. With these online tools, you also get the opportunity to upload the converted file on various social media channels.

Not only do product ad videos help your products to stand out among the very many, but it also brings about numerous engagements from your audience by making your products to be found online by both far and near viewers. Product ad video answers every question in the heart of the audience and makes the audience build trust in the products. There are a lot of things to put into consideration while going for product ads videos and they include:

## 1\. Good Quality Video and Picture Coverage

Now, among several things to consider in creating product ad video, is good and quality video or picture coverage which can only be possible when there is correct lighting that can help to get a very clear video or image of those products. This helps attract the attention of the customers. This also makes your products stand out among several products on sale. It also will help in creating quality videos because the quality of the pictures and the videos are not compressed.

## 2\. Concise Videos

Another thing to put into consideration is the concise nature of your video. It must be brief and comprehensive. There should not be a lot of bulky information in the video so as not to make the customers tired and burdened.

## 3\. Correct Colour Combination

This is something that must not be neglected in making product ad videos. The colour combination must be correct and matches very well with both the products and the things written on the products. It is better to work at most with just three colours that complement one another. This will not only attract the customers but will make the customer see how professional you are and will pay anything to get the products.

## 4\. Short Videos

Videos are best with at most one minute depending on the platforms you want to advertise them on. This will make the customers not wait for a long time to understand the video and it will help the client to make the decision quickly without wasting a lot of time. It will help him make the decision quickly. Studies and statistics have it that attention span is only 8.5 seconds so you must try to make proper use of the first few seconds of your video.

## 5\. Product Prize

The goals of a product ads video are to either make the announcement of a new product on sale or to also advertise particular products to sell to make great sales. Therefore, if the product needs to be sold, then the prize should be written down boldly in such a way that the buyer can see the price. The real prize and the promo size can also be written to entice the customers more to buy.

## 6\. Text, The Font Styles, The Font Size And The Font Color

This is another important area that must not be neglected. This is another area in product ads that catches the eyes of the customers. So, the font, the font styles, and font color must go in line with the products, the text on the products and the background color of the products.

## 7\. Aspect Ratio

This is another important thing to consider while making the video for product ads. Each social media platform has its unique aspect ratio. Aspect ratio talks about the ratio of the length and width of a video. Therefore before creating any video for any platform, first look for the aspect ratio of the platform. Facebook has its aspect ratio as also Instagram, TikTok, Facebook story and reels. This will make your video fit into the platform and make the video come out professionally and grandly.

## 8\. Product Ads Software/Applications

Aside from knowing all that has been discussed, it is important to look out for the best software for the job. There is a lot of software that will be of help in creating product ads videos, go for the ones that you can understand and can help you create product ads video. Software like:

* Video Guru.
* Videolicious.
* AndroVid
* FiLMiC Pro.
* movie.
* Doodly.
* WeVideo.
* Vimeo Create.
* Power Director.

## 9\. Good Reviews

Another important thing that makes product ad videos convert and confidence in the heart of the audience is the reviews from customers who have used such products. Therefore, try always to get reviews on the products from buyers. Now, it can come as a note, audio or video of the buyers reviewing the product. Adding these reviews from various buyers will not only draw the attention of viewers but also make them trust the authenticity of the products. So, try to add such reviews to your product ads video.

## 10\. Graphics And Music

This is important also in creating product ad videos. You need nice and eye-catching graphics and music that goes in line with the products. Your music must be good and 100% natural.

## 11\. Call To Action

This is a very important thing that must not be exempted in your product ads videos. Your video must have the ability to call the audience to action. Now after all has been done and the question in the heart of the audience will be, ’How can I get this product?’.The ‘call to action answers this question. So, it must be included. The call to action can be at the beginning of the video, middle of the video and end of the video but it is best placed in the middle and at end of the video.

The above and more are what should be considered and applied if you want a product ads video that can convert very well and yield massive sales.

## Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video

The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don't need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.

Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you're on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don't have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we've put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you'll need to know to make stunning films, even if you've never done it before. We'll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.

## **Part 1\. Edit Recorded Video in OBS**

OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It's open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.

**Step 1\. Download and Install OBS**

Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.

**Step 2\. Setup Screen Recording**

The window is divided into separate parts called "docks" when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you'll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.

![obs setup screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg)

You'll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).

**Step 3\. Customize the Recording Source**

You'll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select "Display Capture" by clicking the "+" icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click "OK". At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.

![obs customize the recording source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg)

**Step 4\. Start/Stop Recording**

You'll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you're ready to begin recording. When you're finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.

## Goal of a Video Introduction to Follow

Making intro video is not just only in doing a YouTube channel but you can also use this guide for any businesses like brand presentation, educational etc.

Step1 Start by introducing yourself.

Step2 Get into details.

Step3 Add a call to action.

Step4 Add personalization to your video.

Step5 Video Length.

### 1\. Start by introducing yourself

You can always start your intro by introducing yourself but don't just state your name and what

you do, tell them why you do it, what your core values are and what motivates and dives you to

do this kind of career. Because you all know doing vlog on YouTube is a job, work, and a career.

Share emotions with your audience, and help them relate to you. Doing so is going to help you stand out immediately from the crowd and get audiences interested enough to watch the remainder of your video's content.

### 2\. Get into details

Tip is always direct to the point, add a few facts about yourself, like your interest or previous experiences or who you are as a person. If you are a business owner and would want to talk about your business you can always share how it started.

If we are talking about the YouTube intro video. Every good YouTube intro video usually includes beneficial information for subscribers and viewers.

Keep your informative text in a consistent format and branding style.

### 3\. Add a call to action

if you have successfully maintained the interest of your viewer until the very end of your video, use this opportunity to invite them to engage with your content more. It's worth including a call to action in each video. Take a full advantage of YouTube to provide your audience with your social media channels and maybe a link or two to your other videos that might interest them,

### 4\. Add personalization to your video

Even though an intro can be more than logo animation, the latter should still be a part of it. Otherwise, there's a sense that something is messing. Include eye catchy visuals effects to your videos to stands out, so that people can easily remember your YouTube channel.

![personalize youtube intro video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/personalize-youtube-intro-video-filmora.jpg)

### 5\. Video length

A long intro, even if it's spectacular, can get boring once your audience has seen it a few times. An ideal length for intros is up to 8-10 seconds only. Just enough time to deliver your message and branding, and hook audiences in for the rest of the video. Any longer than that, and you might lose viewers who are waiting to see the video that they clicked on.

In the era of social media, tempting distractions and short attention spans, it's critical to keep your content as short and sharp as you can.

## Goal of a Video Introduction to Follow

Making intro video is not just only in doing a YouTube channel but you can also use this guide for any businesses like brand presentation, educational etc.

Step1 Start by introducing yourself.

Step2 Get into details.

Step3 Add a call to action.

Step4 Add personalization to your video.

Step5 Video Length.

### 1\. Start by introducing yourself

You can always start your intro by introducing yourself but don't just state your name and what

you do, tell them why you do it, what your core values are and what motivates and dives you to

do this kind of career. Because you all know doing vlog on YouTube is a job, work, and a career.

Share emotions with your audience, and help them relate to you. Doing so is going to help you stand out immediately from the crowd and get audiences interested enough to watch the remainder of your video's content.

### 2\. Get into details

Tip is always direct to the point, add a few facts about yourself, like your interest or previous experiences or who you are as a person. If you are a business owner and would want to talk about your business you can always share how it started.

If we are talking about the YouTube intro video. Every good YouTube intro video usually includes beneficial information for subscribers and viewers. Add any short important text that you feel is necessary from the video titles, your YouTube channel name, and social media handles. Keep your informative text in a consistent format and branding style.

### 3\. Add a call to action

if you have successfully maintained the interest of your viewer until the very end of your video, use this opportunity to invite them to engage with your content more. It's worth including a call to action in each video. Take a full advantage of YouTube to provide your audience with your social media channels and maybe a link or two to your other videos that might interest them,

### 4\. Add personalization to your video

Even though an intro can be more than logo animation, the latter should still be a part of it. Otherwise, there's a sense that something is messing. Include eye catchy visuals effects to your videos to stands out, so that people can easily remember your YouTube channel.

### 5\. Video length

A long intro, even if it's spectacular, can get boring once your audience has seen it a few times. An ideal length for intros is up to 8-10 seconds only. Just enough time to deliver your message and branding, and hook audiences in for the rest of the video. Any longer than that, and you might lose viewers who are waiting to see the video that they clicked on.

In the era of social media, tempting distractions and short attention spans, it's critical to keep your content as short and sharp as you can.

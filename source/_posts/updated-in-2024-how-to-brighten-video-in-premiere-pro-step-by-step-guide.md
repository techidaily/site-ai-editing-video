## Can I Brighten A Dark Video?

This is a common question that comes up among video editors, so I thought I'd answer it here. The quick answer is yes. There are many online tools that can help you brighten a dark video or adjust the brightness of your video. A lot of times, you'll get a video file that was shot in low light, and it will make your subject look dark and underexposed. Video brightness is an important feature that is easy to adjust. However, if your video is too dark to start off with, it may be difficult to brighten it in a way that doesn't look unnatural.

There are several ways you can brighten a dark video. For example, you can use color correction or add more light to the scene before you film. If you already have a dark video, then you'll need to adjust the contrast and brightness of your video during post-production. You can easily do this by using video editing software but keep in mind that too much brightness or too much contrast can result in poor video quality. So, you have to keep everything in balance.

## How to Brighten Video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Adobe Premiere Pro is your one-stop solution for editing videos, whether you're editing a film or a TV ad. It gives you the flexibility to edit videos of any format. Adobe Premium makes brightening videos easy. Follow the steps below.

### Step 1

## How To Lighten Up A Dark Video In Adobe Premiere Pro?

The first method that we used was quite simple. All you needed to do was to increase the brightness of the video, and you were good to go. But this method is a bit different. Although it is a little more complicated than the first method, it can do wonders for you. Suppose you have a video shot in very dim light, and it has a lot of dark sections. There is a chance that Increasing the brightness won't do much. So, you can use this method to brighten your video and improve its visibility. Just follow the steps mentioned below:

### Step 1

If you haven't already opened your video in Adobe Premiere Pro, launch the program and import your footage. Then drag it onto the timeline so that it appears at the top.

### Step 2

Effects tab can be found in the left-most panel of adobe premiere pro. Click the Effects tab and search for Lightning effects in the search bar and click on it.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-3.png)

### Step 3

Use the drag-and-drop method to add the lighting effects to the clip. Once you have done that, you will feel like your video is having a distorted flash-like effect. But don't worry as we are not going for that.

### Step 4

Now go to the effects control tab present at the top of the screen, and from there, you have to click on the lighting effects.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - go to effects control tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-4.png)

### Step 5

Once you click on the lighting effects, you will see many options on your screen. Click on the "Light 1" button to open its dropdown menu. There you will see the spotlight selected by default.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - click the lighting effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-5.png)

### Step 6

Click on the dropdown icon adjacent to the spotlight to open up the menu. You need to select "Directional" instead of Spotlight, and you will notice that the dark sections have been brightened significantly.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - choose directional](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-6.png)

### Step 7

The brightness intensity can even be increased by changing the value for the intensity option within the effect control panel.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - change value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-7.png)

## Enhancing Your Video In Premiere Pro

Once you have done all the steps above, you can also use the video enhancing feature of adobe premiere pro to improve the quality of your videos. When you brighten a video, there is a chance that you might lose quality a little bit. So, to overcome that deficiency, this method might be helpful. Enhancing your videos with Premiere Pro is easy once you know the proper steps to do so. Just follow the steps described below:

### Step 1

In the effects panel, search for "unsharp Mask" and drag it to the video clip.

![enhance video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-8.png)

### Step 2

![enhance video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-9.png)

Keep in mind that you can increase the values of these parameters too high, but you will end up with a distorted video. Try increasing the values by small increments and see what happens. Avoid increasing the "amount" and radius value beyond 100% and ten, respectively.

## Conclusion

● Brightening in Premiere Pro is a simple process that can benefit some video projects. Whether you want to brighten the video by increasing exposure, increasing luminance, or adding a vignette effect altogether, there are several ways to do so in Premiere Pro.

If you haven't already opened your video in Adobe Premiere Pro, launch the program and import your footage. Then drag it onto the timeline so that it appears at the top.

### Step 2

Effects tab can be found in the left-most panel of adobe premiere pro. Click the Effects tab and search for Lightning effects in the search bar and click on it.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-3.png)

### Step 3

Use the drag-and-drop method to add the lighting effects to the clip. Once you have done that, you will feel like your video is having a distorted flash-like effect. But don't worry as we are not going for that.

### Step 4

Now go to the effects control tab present at the top of the screen, and from there, you have to click on the lighting effects.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - go to effects control tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-4.png)

### Step 5

Once you click on the lighting effects, you will see many options on your screen. Click on the "Light 1" button to open its dropdown menu. There you will see the spotlight selected by default.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - click the lighting effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-5.png)

### Step 6

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - choose directional](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-6.png)

### Step 7

## Enhancing Your Video In Premiere Pro

Once you have done all the steps above, you can also use the video enhancing feature of adobe premiere pro to improve the quality of your videos. When you brighten a video, there is a chance that you might lose quality a little bit. So, to overcome that deficiency, this method might be helpful. Enhancing your videos with Premiere Pro is easy once you know the proper steps to do so. Just follow the steps described below:

### Step 1

In the effects panel, search for "unsharp Mask" and drag it to the video clip.

![enhance video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-8.png)

### Step 2

In the effect control panel under the Unsharp mask, set the amounts, radius, and threshold to enhance the video.

![enhance video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-9.png)

Keep in mind that you can increase the values of these parameters too high, but you will end up with a distorted video. Try increasing the values by small increments and see what happens. Avoid increasing the "amount" and radius value beyond 100% and ten, respectively.

## Conclusion

● Brightening in Premiere Pro is a simple process that can benefit some video projects. Whether you want to brighten the video by increasing exposure, increasing luminance, or adding a vignette effect altogether, there are several ways to do so in Premiere Pro.

● However, you should know that neither option is necessarily better than the other. Video editing in general does take a bit of practice to master, but in this article, we have provided you with the basics and helped you on your way. All methods can be helpful in different situations, and even with similar circumstances, you might find advantages to all practices. Try out these methods for yourself and see which one best suits your needs.

## 4 Ways to Loop a Video on Vimeo

Vimeo is a popular video streaming platform where you can watch videos all day. Vimeo is a close competitor of YouTube. If you are a regular viewer on Vimeo, you may want to watch a video in a loop.

Step 3: After making the changes, press Enter key. The same video will play in a loop until you pause the video or close the web browser's tab.

## Way 2\. Loop a Vimeo Video When Embedded on Your Site

After the video ends playing, the embedding will show suggested videos. If you want the same video to play again and again, you have to put it in a loop. Here are the steps on how to loop Vimeo video when embedded on your website.

Step 1: Open the Vimeo video on your web browser. Click on Share icon present inside the player in the top-right corner.

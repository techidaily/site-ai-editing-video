## Part 3\. Green Screen Video Tips to Use

We have already stated that replacing green screen in your video with an eye-catching background is the easiest part. On the contrary, shooting the green screen video is the most important part. If you shoot the video perfectly, replacing the background accurately in the video editor becomes super easy. Here are some important tips to use while shooting green screen video.

**Distance** – There should be enough distance between the subject and the green screen background so that the subject does not cast a shadow on the green screen. This distance is also important to place lights in between so that the green screen is perfectly lit for a great video shooting session.

**Quality** – You should opt for a high-quality green screen cloth for the background. This means the green screen should have a solid color instead of light and dark patches here and there. Besides, you should ensure that there are no wrinkles on the green screen.

Otherwise, when you will apply green screen effect through the video editor, the transformation will be uneven. You have to spend a lot of time adjusting the parameters to cover up uneven patches in the background.

**Lighting** – The way you set up your lights plays a major role in shooting green screen video perfectly. The light falling on the green screen will light up the screen evenly so that there are no light and dark patches. Transforming the green screen in the video editor will become that much easier.

You should focus on soft and even lighting for the entire green screen, and you should check through your camera to ensure the lighting is perfect. Sometimes, you can place lights behind the subject if the subject is staying stationary throughout the video. Otherwise, you can place the light above the subject for even distribution.

**Aperture** – The settings of your camera are equally important to smoothen out the green screen in the background and focus on the subject sharply. That is where aperture comes into the scene, and you need to use low aperture while shooting green screen videos. Low aperture opens up the camera lens, and the green screen turns softer in the background. The subject stands out while the background turns uniformly green.

**Shutter Speed** – While shooting a green screen video, you should keep a high shutter speed to prevent motion blur and uneven background. If the subject stays fixed throughout, the shutter speed should be double the frame rate. If the subject is moving throughout, the shutter speed should be around 4 times the frame rate such as 1/100.

**ISO** – The last thing you want in a green screen video is grainy footage. Your life will turn upside down editing the video and getting the green screen effect perfectly in any video editor. ISO determines the sensitivity and thereby, the grainy effect in your video. When the ISO is too high, the chance of getting grains in the video is high. It is better to use a native ISO for green screen effect, but you need to check with a sample recording and adjust if required.

## Conclusion

We have answered how to add background to green screen Final Cut Pro. You can replace any green screen in your video with any video or photo for the background of the video. If you do not have Final Cut Pro or you find the steps slightly complicated, we recommend you to use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for instant green screen effect and quick adjustments for the best outcome.

* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.

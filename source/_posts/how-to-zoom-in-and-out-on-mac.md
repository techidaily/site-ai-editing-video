## How to Zoom In and Out on Mac

Having difficulties seeing the small print on your Mac's screen? You can easily enlarge the whole screen with just a few clicks with this guide of how-to un-zoom on mac; which is useful for anybody with poor vision in particular. Users of the macOS operating system may zoom in and out on tiny, difficult-to-read text and pictures in a variety of ways. Would you want to interact closely with anything on your Mac? Maybe you'd like to see things from a broader angle so you would require a **how to zoom out on Mac** tutorial.

In any case, you have our support. There are various ways to zoom in and out on a Mac, whether you want to do it for the whole screen or just a specific window. For your benefit, we went through many different methods to zoom out on a Mac today. Apple provides a wide range of customizing possibilities. We'll provide you practical advice on how to utilize your keyboard, mouse, trackpad, or browser to zoom in MacBook. Let's get started straight now without further ado.

## Way 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts

When using an app, holding down Command key while using the plus (+) or minus (-) keys will allow you to zoom in or out as needed. Using the keyboard on your Mac, you may zoom in and out at intervals of 10%; when you do, a pop-up menu with the option to reset (i.e., return to the default, or 100%, zoom level) will display at the top of the screen. Instead of touching or repeating the shortcut, just keep holding the plus or minus key to zoom farther. Accessibility Zoom, which was created as a tool for the blind and enables you to zoom in on a Mac to see tiny text and precisely change settings with checkboxes, must be enabled if you wish to zoom in on the whole screen rather than just an app window (such as Utilities).

### Steps to Use Keyboard Shortcut to Zoom in MacBook

Step1Go to Accessibility > System Preferences > Zoom, then click Zoom in the sidebar. Check the check next to "Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom" after that. Click the command key (located on either side of the space bar).

![how to zoom in/out on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-zoom-from-accessibility.jpg)

Step2Press the plus/equal sign ("+ =") button, which is adjacent to the delete button on the top right side of the keyboard, while continuing to hold down the command button to zoom in.

Step3Press the dash/underscore button ("- \_"), which is situated next to the "+ =" button on the top right side of the keyboard, while still holding down the command button, to zoom out.

## Way 2: Use Trackpad Gestures

You may quickly learn how to zoom in on a Mac using trackpad movements if you prefer using a touchpad versus learning any kind of keyboard shortcuts. With a MacBook, there is another, maybe simpler way to zoom in and out in addition to the approach mentioned above. If your keyboard isn't entirely working, it may still be helpful. However, make sure that gesture support is turned on in the settings on your Mac. Although a Mac still supports the usage of a mouse, new Mac software is designed to be used with a trackpad. Apple is abandoning the mouse. And with a little practice, you can do it too. What you must do is as follows:

### Steps to Enable Trackpad Gestures

Step1Open System Preferences and choose Trackpad. Next, choose the Scroll & Zoom tab and select the "Smart zoom" checkbox. Zooming in on web sites, photos, and documents couldn't be much simpler after gesture support was set up:

![how to zoom in/out on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/trackpad-scroll-zoom.jpg)

Step2You can zoom in or out on Mac by placing two fingers on the touchpad and moving one finger closer to the other or further apart (repeat for additional zooming)

Step3Another option is to simply zoom in and out by double-tapping the touchpad with two fingers.

## Way 3: Use Scroll Gesture

If you'd like to use your mouse, you may utilize the screen zoom option, which enlarges everything on your screen rather than just the app window you're now viewing. This would need holding down one of the designated modifier keys while scrolling in order to zoom in on a Mac. Just like on an iPhone or iPad, you can zoom in and out by pinching and un-pinching. The smart zoom motion, on the other hand, is executed by double-tapping with two fingers. This immediately zooms into or immediately zooms out of a web page or pdf.

### Steps to Enable Scroll Gesture

Step1To make this feature active, from the Apple menu, choose System Preferences and select Accessibility. Choose Zoom from the sidebar.

![how to zoom in/out on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-scroll-gesture.jpg)

Step2Select "Use scroll motion with modifier keys to zoom" from the drop-down menu as shown above.

Step3Select the desired modifier key from the dropdown menu.

## Way 4: Enable Hover Text to Zoom

Use the wonderful assistive feature called Hover Text to enlarge a single macOS user interface piece without zooming out the whole Mac screen. One of your alternatives is to enable zooming while hovering over text. The "Enable Hover Text" option is part of the Zoom menu but does not directly magnify the display. The function allows users to use the Command key to momentarily enlarge just the text below the pointer and is accessible without Zoom having to be activated. When Hover Text is enabled on your Mac, you may drag the cursor over anything on the screen, such as text, input fields, menu items, or buttons, and a high-resolution magnified version of those objects will appear in a new window. Find out here how to make Hover Text available on your Mac:

### Steps to Use Hover Text to Zoom

Step1When you choose this option, a larger, higher-resolution picture of the text your cursor is over will show as long as you press and hold down the "Command" key. Click "Options" to modify the text's appearance.

![how to zoom in/out on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-hover-text-to-zoom.jpg)

Step2Additional customization options are available in the Options menu, including the ability to alter the font, the size of the zoomed-in text (which may range from 14pt to 128pt), the font's appearance surrounding the cursor, and the modifier key that activates the function.

![how to zoom in/out on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/customize-text-options.jpg)

## Way 5: Enable Touch Bar

This substitute is only accessible on Macs equipped with Touch Bars. A handy feature is the Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is a feature on every current MacBook Pro model, including the 13-inch and 16-inch versions. On the Touch Bar, there is a mix of App Controls and a Control Strip. To use with your compatible MacBook Pro, the Touch Bar has additional features. Although it is helpful right out of the box, some customization may be required for your advantage. Fortunately, Apple makes modifications rather straightforward. You may change your default by following the instructions below.

### Steps to Enable Touch Bar on MacBook

Step1The Touch Bar at the bottom of your display will grow and become easier to view if you choose the "Enable Touch Bar zoom" option. Now all you have to do is touch and hold the Touch Bar to test it out.

Step2Click the Apple symbol in the upper left corner of your screen and choose "System Preferences" to activate the touch bar in another method.

Step3Select "Keyboard" > "Keyboard" and then select "Touch Bar shows" under the Touch Bar settings. Then choose an option from the menu, which also includes the larger Control Strip and app buttons.

Many of these GoPro video editors for Mac (free and paid) are available on the internet. Therefore, it can be hard sometimes to choose the right GoPro video editor for Mac. However, you’ll need to consider factors before making your choice. Here are some of these factors.

**Level of Expertise**

This is a vital factor you should put into consideration before choosing a GoPro video editor. As a beginner, you wouldn’t need a GoPro editor that offers complex editing functions that you can’t use.

## Have You Ever Created a Slow Motion Video on Your Phonr or Camera? This Article Will Show You some Knowledge About Slow Motion Photography

Scenes that might otherwise be monotonous can be made more interesting by the use of slow-motion photography in movies and television shows. For instance, a battle sequence between two characters can be portrayed in its entirety, but if it is later replayed in slow motion, the intensity of the action is amplified significantly.

Let’s dive in!

## 1\. What is slow motion?

Filmmakers use the slow-motion effect to create the illusion that the passage of time has been slowed down on the screen. In the early 20th century, an Austrian priest named August Musger was the one who came up with the idea. Playing normally recorded material at a slower pace is another method for creating the illusion of slow motion.

When a film is recorded at 25 frames per second, but played back at 24 frames per second, it will seem as if it is being shown in slow motion because all of the movements will be slightly slower than when they were actually performed. This is because the film was recorded at 25 frames per second, but the playback was done at 24 frames per second.

Because there are not enough frames to show all of the details of each frame when a 24-frame animation is played at a 25-frame rate (or a 30-frame animation at a 32-frame rate), certain frames have to be repeated (every 5th one in this case). When there is a dramatic event taking place, this manipulation of the film speed makes the action on screen appear even more dramatic or "tensioned."

![what is a slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/what-is-a-slow-motion-video.jpg)

## 2\. Understanding frame rates

When filming video, there are a set number of frames per second that you can choose from. One picture is all you get when you take a still photograph. Click. That is only one example. A frame is the name of that picture. With video, however, you take 30 or 24 images per second, which you then combine. You now have footage.

The video is a combination of tens of thousands of frames or images that are flashing before your eyes. With a normal frame rate of 24 frames per second, you are essentially taking 24 pictures per second and stitching them together to create video. When you stretch it out in post for slow motion, you double or triple the frame rate, which results in more images per second and eliminates empty gaps and jarring actions.

This is how video that has been sped up for slow motion may still preserve its quality. But you can't just choose a frame rate based on taste. Frame rates vary depending on the different types of emotions. 60 fps will do if the video is a slo-mo of a person's emotion. However, if your shot contains a lot of movement and you want to show it, such as when automobiles collide or explode, you may require a higher frame rate, such as 120 fps.

![understand frame rates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/understand-frame-rates.jpg)

## 3\. Post processing

This is when it gets a bit complicated. Some cameras come equipped with a slow-motion feature. To capture the video in slow motion at a higher frame rate, go to your settings. You might not have this built-in slow-motion feature in other models.

Therefore, even though the footage was taken at a higher frame rate, the camera is playing the movie back at the same pace it was shot at, so when you shoot at a higher frame rate, you end up with footage of a normal speed. There is a solution to that. The footage's speed can be adjusted during post-production.

The 24/30 fps editing timelines are pre-set. The majority of the video you capture at this frame rate plays back just nicely on this timeline. You must stretch out video that was shot at a higher frame rate to match this timeline, though. That effectively doubles or triples the length of a video, depending on the multiple of the timeline's typical frame rate.

## 4\. Lighting

While watching TV or movies, you might have observed anything. The majority of the extremely slow photos happen in broad daylight. Not after dark or in dimly lit areas. The reason for this is that sufficient lighting is required in order to capture motion. Lighting becomes crucial as your frame rate exceeds 300 frames per second. Therefore, if you must take these pictures, you must do so in a studio environment with lots of artificial lighting.

To create that cinematic magic, you can use high CRI lighting. On the screen, a flickering light may spell doom. Flickering lights have the potential to damage slow-motion film even though they would be OK for any other scene. Because there is no risk of voltage fluctuation, LED lights are a safe bet. The reason for this is that some models do not require an electrical outlet to function. Prior to departure, make sure you have checked each and every light.

If you are filming during the day and you point your camera toward the sun, you may end up with a significant amount of glare that cannot be hidden up in the post-production stage nor can it be ignored. This is not merely a problem that occurs throughout the daytime. Flares can also be obtained from moving vehicles and various other sources of light. If you use a flat lens when you're out at night, you can eliminate the risk of something like that happening.

![choose light for slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-light-for-slow-motion-video.jpg)

## 5\. Why use slow motion?

When you first begin working with slow-motion video, you need to ask yourself, "What exactly is the purpose behind me choosing this effect?" Once you have an answer to that question, you may move on to the next step.

**In most cases, there are often two primary causes for it.**

1\. It makes sense to present emotions on the screen for a longer period of time in order for the audience to be able to absorb and comprehend it in its whole if they are shown for a longer period of time since moments that are packed with emotions seem to endure longer than ordinary ones.

2\. The second strategy is to draw attention to striking visuals that you might have overlooked in other circumstances and that contribute significantly to the aesthetic value of your setting. A flutter of the eyelid, a butterfly stretching its wings, rains falling on a flower petal, shards of fire breaking free, etc. are all examples of how quickly things may happen. You need to have a good reason for using slow motion, and you shouldn't abuse the effect too much too. You should only do so at those moments where it makes logical sense to do so.

![draw attention with slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/draw-attention-with-slow-motion-video.jpg)

Subconscious slow-motion. Overusing or misusing a function ruins its appeal. Filming isn't an exact science, but it does nothing unnecessary. For a cinematic effect, slow-motion should be introduced carefully.

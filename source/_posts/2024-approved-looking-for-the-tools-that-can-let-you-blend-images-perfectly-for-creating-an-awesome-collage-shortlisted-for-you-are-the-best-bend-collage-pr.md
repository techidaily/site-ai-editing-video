## Part 1\. What Are The Benefits of Adding Text Behind Objects in Videos?

Your videos must maintain quality to create content worthy of a huge audience. You may have a YouTube channel or be starting down the road. Then you must give this a try because

Adding text behind an object in a video looks cool! Now, your object could be a silhouette of a person or a huge skyscraper. You can add a text tile behind the object, creating the illusion. Due to this, the text will be flying in real-time.

### Show creativity

Blasting your channel with innovative and creative content is the key to building a big audience. But, of course, you can always opt for many ways to create a video showing your creativity. One of those ways is to add text behind your object.

* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let's dive into it.

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.
* When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.

![add the footage to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-12.png)

##### Step2 Add the text tile

To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.

* Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.
* On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.
* Select the Plain text option.
* You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.
* Select the text title that suits you best.
* After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.

![add the text tile above the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png)

* Our next step would be to add the text.
* **Double-click** on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.
* Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, **"Hello world."**

![type in the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png)

Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.

##### Step3 Take a snapshot

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

![taking a snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png)

* In the main play screen, you can notice a small **camera icon**.
* This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.
* Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.
* Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.

![snapshot is saved in the import library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:

* Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.
* Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.
* Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.
* If it is **longer** than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.
* If its length is **smaller** than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.

![adjust the length of the snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png)

After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.

##### Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot

To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text's blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.

Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:

* **Double-click** the snapshot.
* If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.
* From default, it would be set to **Normal**. Click on the **Normal**
* It will show a drop-down option.
* Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on **Overlay.**

![change the blending mode to overlay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-18.png)

* And press **OK** in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.

The text can be blended with the background.

* Click on the **Eye icon** to un-hide the video from the timeline.
* Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.

Firstly, these aren't just drag-and-drop effects. You must install Adobe Premiere Pro on your computer.

Step1: The first step is to install the presets in your After Effects presets folder. After downloading and unzipping the free presets, copy and paste them.

Step2: As soon as you have copied the presets to the AE presets folder, you can open a PP project and replace the effects in your videos by choosing: Replace with After Effects Composition.

Step3: Verify the composition settings in Premiere Pro, and see if 4K or FHD are selected.

Step4: If you want to start adding presets to NULL objects, you can do so by creating them. To add Motion Blur, you will need footage and the overall composition. Next, you can adjust keyframes and use Motion Tiles.

Follow the step-by-step guide to merge videos using Photos App on Windows 10:

### Step 1: Lauch the Photos App

You might wish to put all of the films or photographs you want to merge into one folder on your computer before going to the Photos app. It will aid in the speeding up of the entire procedure.

Type 'Photos' into your computer's search bar, then click on the program that appears.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-6.jpg)

### Step 2: Start a New Video Project

You want to start your video production after launching the Photos app. To do so, go to the top right corner of your screen and select New Video Project, which will take you to the editor mode.

The second part of this procedure is known by several titles in different versions of Windows 10's Photos app, such as creating a video with music, creating a film with text, and a new video project.

Launching the editor mode directly from the photo if you're using photos in your video project is also possible. In that case, consider the following:

* Open your file in the Photos app
* Select Edit & Create
* Select Create a movie with text from the drop-down menu.

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-7.jpg)

* In the empty box, type the text you wish to add.
* Select the font style you want to use.

Whether you have two MP4 clips or videos with different extensions, you can easily merge them into one with Filmora. To do that, position both videos on the same track without space. Then, export the project in your desired output format, such as MP4.

### Q2\. What is the best app for combining videos?

For fast video joining, you can choose Filmora or Adobe Premiere Pro. Both apps are available on Windows and Mac operating systems. Moreover, the combining process is also trouble-free.

### Q3\. How to merge two videos without losing quality?

Professionals with years of video editing experience choose Premiere Pro to maintain the quality of the merged videos. But remember, any mistakes in the export settings can reduce the calibre. Contrarily, Filmora offers user-friendly and uncomplicated export options so you can save combined videos in the highest quality possible.

## The Bottom Line

Different methods of merging videos depend primarily on the type of program you intend to use. The step-by-step guide is to help beginners move ahead in their careers and choose the best method that they find easy. Each method is easy-to-use and accessible by all users. Also, it doesn't require you to invest money to purchase premium versions of video merging softwares.

However, there are some other softwares that can also be used to merge videos. But they are complex and makes it challenging for a beginner to merge videos easily.

## Want to Learn How to Create the Random Letter Reveal Intro? Read Through the Stages of Preparing This Effect via Filmora in This Guide

The introductions in the video can create a major feel for the rest of the video in the viewers' minds. So, most film and video makers focus on developing different styles of appealing and visually vibrant intro title formats for their projects.

Currently, one of the unique types of title format that is popular today among Youtubers and filmmakers is the style of random letters appearing on screen until the main title forms.

![example of random letter reveal intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-0.gif)

Wondering how to have the same effect for your video? This process will work easily with certain software tools, the most user-friendly and simple being the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software. Let's understand the steps that go into this process here.

## 1\. Launch Filmora on your Device

On Filmora's official website, you can get the latest software version when you click on the Download button at the top or in the description box. After you do so, the free software will download automatically into your device in an installer format.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

From the Downloads section of your browser, double-click on it and press the Install button when it appears. Give the necessary permissions that it prompts.

![click on the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-1.jpg)

Then, the software will start the installation instantly, likely taking a few seconds to complete.

## 2\. Add the Default Title and Edit its Font

After Filmora launches, click on the "Create New Project" button on the homepage of the editor. Then, click on the Title tab from the top toolbar and choose the default title available here. Drag it and drop it onto the editing timeline below on Track 1.

Double-click on the title on the timeline, which will open the text editing window. Under the Text's Preset tab, you will find the parameters for changing the main fault. Adjust the font style to the Impact style (or any bold title style you prefer), and click on the text field to add your custom title.

Following that, click on the text size option and change it to 15\. Scroll down the menu to the Text Spacing section. Change the value to 20 and tap on the OK button afterward.

![change the value here to 20](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-2.jpg)

## 3\. Split the title

On the editing timeline, tap on the Track 1 clip and click on the Snapshot icon at the far right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will automatically save in the media library section.

Then, take hold of the playhead on the timeline at the 3rd frame mark. Then, tap on the Scissor icon on the play head, which will split the clip into two portions. Click on the part following the 3rd frame mark and delete it.

![split the clip into two portions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-3.jpg)

## 4\. Copy the clipped section multiple times

Then, double-click on the amount still available on the timeline to open the title editor section again. Make changes to the title you added here, only keeping the first letter.

Click on this clipped section on the timeline and copy it. Next, keep copying this clip multiple times continuously until the length of the collection on Track 1 to the 5-second mark.

Following that, zoom in on the timeline for a better view of these clipped parts. Choose the last clip that you copied and drag it to expand its time duration to the 6:15 mark.

![zoom in on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-4.jpg)

## 5\. Change the character of each clip

After making the previous edits, use your cursor to move to the first part of the timeline instead of zooming outward. Tap on the first clip that you had edited and double-click on it. In the text editing window, change the character to another random alphabet.

![change the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-5.jpg)

Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet. At this time, ensure that you do not make two consecutive letters have the same alphabet, as that will put off the effect. However, keep the last elongated clip the same character as you originally put it.

## 6\. Export the first letter clip

Then, please tap on the Export button at the top of the screen and add a name, like the first letter of your title. Click on the Settings button on this page to adjust the resolution and quality of the clip to the highest resolution for the best results.

Press Export again to save it to your device.

## 7\. Edit the second letter clip and so on

After exporting the first file that will ultimately become the first letter of your random letter reveal intro title, you have to make the second letter-related clip.

For this, tap on the last clip on the timeline and double-click on it. Change the text in this clip to the second letter of your title. After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.

![tap on the text field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-6.jpg)

Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.

Now that you know how to edit the first and second letters in sequence, repeat this process for all of the letters of your title to create a full clip for all of the intro title letters. When you are done, please select these clips and press the Delete button to remove them from the timeline.

![select all of these clips and press delete](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-7.jpg)

## 8\. Add all clips back to Filmora

Now it's time to add all of the clips to Filmora and merge them into one cohesive intro title.

For this, click on My Media and go to Project Media. Right-click on the library section and press the Import button. This will take you to your device storage. Find the location where you saved all cut clips, and select them all. Press the Open button, and all of them will import into Filmora.

![press the open button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-8.jpg)

## 9\. Drag the Snapshot to Timeline

Tap on the Snapshot you saved earlier sitting on the media library and drag it onto the Track 1 of the editing timeline. Double-click on it to open the video editing window.

Click on the Opacity option in the Video editing section and change it to 20%. Press the OK button after that.

![click on the opacity option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-9.jpg)

## 10\. Drop the Clip into the Timeline

Select the first letter clip from the media library section and drag it onto the timeline. Drop it above the Snapshot in Track 2 part. Then, choose the first Snapshot clip and increase its duration to the 8-second mark.

Next, double-click on the first letter clip on the Track 2 section to open its editing window. Click on the Blending Mode option and choose Screen from the drop-down menu.

![click on blending mode and choose screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-10.jpg)

Then, right-click on the first letter clip in the timeline and choose the Copy Effects option from the next drop-down menu. Move the playhead to the ending position on the timeline and change the value on the relevant axis of Position until it matches its letter position on the original title.

See the preview playing on the side for a better reference while adjusting the position.

## 11\. Drop the next clips

Following this, click on the second letter clip and drag and drop it onto Track 3 on the timeline. Make sure to move the playhead to mark the starting position of this letter at the 5th frame mark.

Tap on this clip and move your playhead to the end position. Then, right-click on it and choose the Paste Effects option. Double-click on this clip on the timeline and change the position axis value until the letter aligns with its original position per the snapshot. Again, look at the Preview to ensure you align them correctly.

![look at the preview to align clips correctly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-11.jpg)

Repeat this with all the other letters, making sure to change the starting position for each consecutive one-two frame forward.

## 12\. Hide and elongate each clip with snapshots

Then, click on the Snapshot clip on Track 1 and delete it. Following that, click the Hide icon on Track 3, Track 4, and onwards till the last one. Then, move the playhead to the end of the Track 2 clip and click on the Snapshot icon.

Choose the saved snapshot in the library window and drag-and-drop it behind Track 2 clip so it continues into it. Double-click on this Snapshot and choose Screen under Blending Mode. Then, right-click on this Snapshot and select "Copy Effects" from the menu.

![choose copy effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-12.jpg)

Then, hide the Track 2 clip, unhide the Track 3 and Track 4 clip, and take a snapshot of that. As you did with Track 1's screenshot, take this snapshot and place it beside Track 3 clip. Right-click on it and tap on "Paste Effects". Repeat this one by one for all the clips after unhiding them for their particular step.

## 13\. Finishing touches to Opacity

Finally, unhide all the clips and move the playhead to the 8-second mark. Click on the Scissor icon to Split them all at this position and remove the excess. Then, place the playhead at the beginning of Track 3 and double-click on it. Tap the Animation tab this time and adjust the Opacity to 0\. Then, move the playhead ten frames forward and increase the Opacity to 100\. Repeat this for all of the steps.

![adjust opacity to 0](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-13.jpg)

## 14\. Preview and Export

After everything, tap on the Render Preview icon. Make sure to move the second clip on Track 2 as the starting point of the video by moving it to the beginning position. Now, press the Play button under the Preview player.

## How much a wedding videographer costs

Hiring a photographer for your wedding day is likely a given, but you might be wondering about the cost to hire a videographer and if it’s worth the extra expense.

Keep in mind that the average cost of a wedding videographer will largely depend on where you live, how many hours of coverage you want the videographer to capture, and how experienced the professional is. The longer they

’ve been in the business, the more likely the cost will increase.

It is recommended that you start with a standard package and customised it from there to make sure all your bases are covered. You can often get a better bargain this way.

Peak wedding season may also affect the cost some vendors, making coverage from June through December a bit pricier and harder to secure. The range can often run between $1000 and $1,500

Nationwide or as much as $12,500 for a luxury shoot that turns you into a celebrity wedding coverage.

![wedding coverage image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wedding-coverage-image.jpg)

### What include in the packages

Videographers, like wedding photographers, will have a variety of wedding packages for you to choose from.

Here’s what you can expect to see in a basic package

* Three-to-five-minute highlight video
* A 20–30-minute full wedding video with wedding ceremony and speeches
* Two cinematographers
* An assistant to the videographer

### There are also extra. Some videographer offers extras such as

* **Drone footage**– Drones are popular, especially at destination weddings. They have the ability to film hundreds of feet in the air which also makes your wedding video more unique. The extra equipment needed for this can cost you anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000
* **Travel**– Just because you’re getting married in a far-off place doesn’t mean you can’t have your dream videographer. Just be prepared to pay for their travel. You will likely pay for their accommodations, meals, and travel
* **Extra edits**– Videographers spend hours editing your final wedding video, so if you request any additional edits, it’s likely going to cost you
* **Filming before and after the wedding**– Whether your wedding is a weekend long affair or you host a brunch for your friends and family the day of the wedding, filming these moments is going to be additional cost. Discuss plans with your videographer as soon as possible so they can check their availability and they can give you a total for a wedding budget
* **Tipping**– tips are always welcomed even if they’re not expected. Your videographer puts in a lot of time and effort into capturing the beauty of the day, so any gesture of your appreciation will be welcomed.

And know what additional time can cost as much as $200-$500 per half hour, which pays for the videographer’s and assistant time, time spent editing additional footage, and video cards.

These included highlights and wedding videos will be professionally edited and they will also be set to music and delivered to you either via USB or through an online platform.

Typical videography prices also depend on the package you choose during the wedding planning process. Of course, you’re paying for a certain number of hours of coverage on your wedding day, but the post production editing process is even more time consuming and costly. While most videographers will produce an edited wedding movie, some may offer multiple clips at different lengths, like a wedding trailer for social media and a longer cinematic feature. Others might also be willing to give you the raw footage for your own personal use. Be sure to read your contract before making any final decisions so you know exactly what to get after the wedding day.

This one might sound strange. But the most experienced wedding videographer’s typically charge more than the going market rate. Price is a good way to tell who is the longest standing wedding videographer in an area. As the adage goes...you get what you pay for

## Tips on saving money on wedding videographer

While you would need a professional videographer for your wedding and this does cost quite a penny, there are a few tips you could employ in saving on videography costs.

**Time**

As mentioned before, the more time the videographer spends at your event the more it would cost. Therefore, if you are looking to minimize the average cost of a wedding videographer, you could have him stay for only the most important aspects of the wedding. You could skip the pre-wedding prep part and also the last part of the reception. Because everyone now has mobile phone and can tag you what they captured on your social media. You can also use a hashtag where your friends can tag all of your wedding photo captured by them.

**No extras**

Such extras as cinematic effects, drone footage, personalised packaging and extra coppies of the finished product all add up in cost. Leaving extras out will go a long way uncutting costs.

**No editing**

Since post-production is the most time-consuming aspect, accepting the raw footage instead of an edited one would definitely cost less. You could choose to do the editing much later if desired.

You can also do your own editing, it’s also different from the feeling of editing your own wedding footage, because you can actually see the raw footage and personalised the editing.

If its fits in your wedding budget, a videographer is a great addition to your line up of vendors because after all, re-watching your nuptials will be priceless.

Capture the moments you can’t remember, your wedding day is a blur of excitement, love, and happiness. But what about all those special moments that happen when you’re not looking? What about the speeches, the first dance, or your dad’s toast? You might be able to recall some of these memories if they were captured on video but chances are you’ll never know for sure.

How much a wedding videographer costs

Hiring a photographer for your wedding day is likely a given, but you might be wondering about the cost to hire a videographer and if it’s worth the extra expense.

Keep in mind that the average cost of a wedding videographer will largely depend on where you live, how many hours of coverage you want the videographer to capture, and how experienced the professional is. The longer they

’ve been in the business, the more likely the cost will increase.

It is recommended that you start with a standard package and customised it from there to make sure all your bases are covered. You can often get a better bargain this way.

Peak wedding season may also affect the cost some vendors, making coverage from June through December a bit pricier and harder to secure. The range can often run between $1000 and $1,500

Nationwide or as much as $12,500 for a luxury shoot that turns you into a celebrity wedding coverage.

![wedding coverage image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wedding-coverage-image.jpg)

### What include in the packages

Videographers, like wedding photographers, will have a variety of wedding packages for you to choose from.

Here’s what you can expect to see in a basic package

* Three-to-five-minute highlight video
* A 20–30-minute full wedding video with wedding ceremony and speeches
* Two cinematographers
* An assistant to the videographer

### There are also extra. Some videographer offers extras such as

* **Drone footage**– Drones are popular, especially at destination weddings. They have the ability to film hundreds of feet in the air which also makes your wedding video more unique. The extra equipment needed for this can cost you anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000
* **Travel**– Just because you’re getting married in a far-off place doesn’t mean you can’t have your dream videographer. Just be prepared to pay for their travel. You will likely pay for their accommodations, meals, and travel
* **Extra edits**– Videographers spend hours editing your final wedding video, so if you request any additional edits, it’s likely going to cost you
* **Filming before and after the wedding**– Whether your wedding is a weekend long affair or you host a brunch for your friends and family the day of the wedding, filming these moments is going to be additional cost. Discuss plans with your videographer as soon as possible so they can check their availability and they can give you a total for a wedding budget
* **Tipping**– tips are always welcomed even if they’re not expected. Your videographer puts in a lot of time and effort into capturing the beauty of the day, so any gesture of your appreciation will be welcomed.

And know what additional time can cost as much as $200-$500 per half hour, which pays for the videographer’s and assistant time, time spent editing additional footage, and video cards.

These included highlights and wedding videos will be professionally edited and they will also be set to music and delivered to you either via USB or through an online platform.

Typical videography prices also depend on the package you choose during the wedding planning process. Of course, you’re paying for a certain number of hours of coverage on your wedding day, but the post production editing process is even more time consuming and costly. While most videographers will produce an edited wedding movie, some may offer multiple clips at different lengths, like a wedding trailer for social media and a longer cinematic feature. Others might also be willing to give you the raw footage for your own personal use. Be sure to read your contract before making any final decisions so you know exactly what to get after the wedding day.

This one might sound strange. But the most experienced wedding videographer’s typically charge more than the going market rate. Price is a good way to tell who is the longest standing wedding videographer in an area. As the adage goes...you get what you pay for

## Tips on saving money on wedding videographer

While you would need a professional videographer for your wedding and this does cost quite a penny, there are a few tips you could employ in saving on videography costs.

**Time**

As mentioned before, the more time the videographer spends at your event the more it would cost. Therefore, if you are looking to minimize the average cost of a wedding videographer, you could have him stay for only the most important aspects of the wedding. You could skip the pre-wedding prep part and also the last part of the reception. Because everyone now has mobile phone and can tag you what they captured on your social media. You can also use a hashtag where your friends can tag all of your wedding photo captured by them.

**No extras**

Such extras as cinematic effects, drone footage, personalised packaging and extra coppies of the finished product all add up in cost. Leaving extras out will go a long way uncutting costs.

**No editing**

Since post-production is the most time-consuming aspect, accepting the raw footage instead of an edited one would definitely cost less. You could choose to do the editing much later if desired.

You can also do your own editing, it’s also different from the feeling of editing your own wedding footage, because you can actually see the raw footage and personalised the editing.

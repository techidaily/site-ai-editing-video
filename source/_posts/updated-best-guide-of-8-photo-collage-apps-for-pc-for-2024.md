## What is Masking?

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage. The mask is the portion of the video you've chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.

Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos.

Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.

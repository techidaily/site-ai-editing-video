## Best Dark Moody LUTs During Editing

Look-up tables (LUTs) are visual editing tools used as color presets. By using LUTs, you can enhance color grading within photos and videos. This way, your visual content looks more aesthetic, engaging, and appealing. Meanwhile, within LUTs, there are several color presets to use. The most popular one is **dark moody LUT**. In this article, you’ll find useful information on dark moody LUTs with the best recommendations.

## Part 1: What Do Dark Moody LUTs Represent?

Like another color preset, dark moody LUTs provide special and unique color grading. So, you’ll experience darkened shadows, desaturated tones, blue tints, green hues, and others. The dark preset filters offer moody looks with pitch-dark effects to your visual content. Hence, these types of LUTs add a foreboding atmosphere.

**Dark and moody LUTs** are used in horror films or thriller cinematography. After all, they provide dedicated dark contrast with gloomy looks to the visual content. Hence, a special dark horror effect is blended, which adds mystery, tension, and fear. For adding dark moody LUTs, several tools are available for enhancing colors.

**Empower your videos with a new mood using different LUTs.** Filmora now offers 100+ top-quality 3D LUTs cover a broad range of scenarios. Transform your videos with Filmora's powerful 3D LUTs.

## Videos Look Better when Edited Professionally. If You’re Looking to Edit Recorded Video with a Pro-Level Editing Then We’ve Got You Covered. Learn About Editing Recorded Videos with the Best Toolkit Here

The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don't need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.

Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you're on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don't have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we've put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you'll need to know to make stunning films, even if you've never done it before. We'll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.

## **Part 1\. Edit Recorded Video in OBS**

OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It's open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.

**Step 1\. Download and Install OBS**

Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.

**Step 2\. Setup Screen Recording**

The window is divided into separate parts called "docks" when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you'll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.

![obs setup screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg)

You'll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).

**Step 3\. Customize the Recording Source**

You'll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select "Display Capture" by clicking the "+" icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click "OK". At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.

![obs customize the recording source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg)

**Step 4\. Start/Stop Recording**

You'll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you're ready to begin recording. When you're finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.

## How to Combine Videos Into One on Instagram

Instagram is your favorite social media platform, and even if you use it frequently, there are still some features you'd like to master. You'd like to post a series of films on the stories, but you're unsure how to put them together.

Suppose things are exactly like this, and you're wondering how to combine numerous videos in Instagram stories. In that case, you'll be happy to know that I'll show you how to do it using the native capability built into the Instagram app for smartphones. I'll also give you some pointers on accomplishing similar tasks utilizing well-known third-party software.

**Combine many clips into a single video and share it on Instagram.**

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-1.jpg)

Here are a few simple methods for combining two or more videos into one and posting them on Instagram (IG).

Using the Instagram official app

There is no simple way to combine many videos into one on Instagram. You can, however, utilize the Story technique.

1) Create an Instagram Story with two or more videos. You can add stickers, text, and other elements if you like.

2) Tap the three dots icon on your Instagram Tale > Save > Save story. Your current Instagram Stories films and photos will be saved to the Photos app as a single video file.

3) Upload the resulting Video to Instagram!

**Tools To Use to Combine videos for Instagram.**

1. Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use video merger.

Before I detail online video joiners, I'd like to mention Wondershare Filmora, which can automatically merge video files without or with transitions. It merges video files with the same or various file extensions in 1:1 quality (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, .avi, etc). Continue reading to learn more about this simple video merging and how to merge videos.

Part 2: Using Filmora to combine, merge, and join clips

To join videos, first, import them.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-2.jpg)

You can drag the files from Windows File Explorer to the User's Album or click the "Import" button on the window and choose files from your computer. All imported files will appear in thumbnail format in the User's Album. To preview a file in the right-hand preview window, double-click it.

1. To merge video files, drag & drop them.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-3.jpg)

Move videos from the User's Album to the video track on the Timeline after that. All video files will be combined into a single video with no transition. However, you can use the following method to add transitions between video clips.

1. Add transitions in the third step (optional)

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-4.jpg)

Add transitions between clips for a smooth transition from one to the next to make the linked videos look like a complete movie. Go to the Transition tab and drag the desired change to the intersection of two clips. You can also right-click any transition to bring up a menu with choices such as "Apply to All" and "Random to All" for your convenience.

Step 4: Combine video files into a single file.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-5.jpg)

Now that you've seen the merged Movie click the "Export" option to save the several video segments to a single file. Select any format from the list under the Format tab. All of the most common video formats are supported. Choose "Device" and choose the thumbnail of your device to play the combined video file on iPod, iPhone, or iPad. You may also publish the combined Video on YouTube or burn it to DVDs to watch on television.

## After Reading This Article, You Can Add a B-Roll Feature From Filmora and Captivate More Audience. Explanation Video B-Roll and Story-Telling B-Roll Are Well Illustrated

Everyone is bored after watching a simple recorded video in which a character explains or tells a story. No one will watch it for more than 4 minutes!

After looking through this article, you will make your video more fascinating and get more views instantly. It's all just due to B-roll, which will act as a ninja feature in your video. In this regard, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will handle everything.

Scroll more to discover two different types of B-roll videos and get an idea of how to make fascinating B-roll videos.

## Part 1\. What Is a B-roll?

B-roll is alternative or supplementary video footage that editors can use to intercut in between their main video. In that way, B-roll can add more information to a scene.

### An additional footage

It is added as a supplementary video to interact with viewers more closely. This feature helps to give more details of a scene.

### Visual representation

When the main explanatory video is too boring, you can add a b-roll to represent the movie's story visually. It can also add to spice up and beat the energy of the narrative.

### Without sound

The B-roll shots are mostly without audio or with little background sound. In most cases, the sound of the primary video is continued while the B-roll footage is just shown.

### Act as a filler

The criteria for the B-roll is to provide the situation of the storyline. Additionally, it could be utilized as filler in between scenes in a movie or television program. B-roll may be found almost anywhere!

In this article, you will learn about two main kinds of B-rolls and the steps to edit them on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Stick with us to the end!

## Part 2\. Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls

When recording any explanatory video, the audience may leave it in the middle of a video if a character explains without any visual representation. When explaining something new, showing the object in B-roll can be more effective than just verbally explaining what the audience is seeing.

Let's take the video we made about microphones as an example. Instead of just verbally introduce the various mics, we inserted B-roll footage to display what they look like and how they can be used. The combination of the visual footage and the background voiceover presents the mic in a more vivid way. Also, it keeps the audience's attention.

![explanation b roll of microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/explanation-b-roll-of-microphone.gif)

**Goal of the explanation B-roll video**

The main goal of this type of B-roll is to show your audience what you are talking about instead of just telling them in a dull way.

## Part 3\. How to Edit Explanation B-roll Footage on Filmora?

After getting the footage and recording shots for B-roll videos, you need to edit it on the Wondershare Filmora. For this, follow the below-mentioned steps:

The most difficult and frequent asking situation is how you know when to cut to B-roll. To get to know when to insert B-roll, follow the following steps:

* Watch your edits back and check out where you need.
* Sense about the dull and complex points and cut the main video from there.
* The points can be easily fixed with visual aids.

![complex and dull points in the primary video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/complex-and-dull-points-in-the-primary-video.jpg)

## Part 4\. Two Types of B-rolls: Storytelling Video B-rolls

During the creation of short films or any storytelling videos, if a person sits and speaks without showing any character or anything else, it will turn boring. Due to this, you have more chances to lose your audience and viewers.

In visual storytelling, if you will insert more clips with close shots, it will make the environment cool. The crazy thing is that you can make mimic shots easily at home by utilizing household objects. Let's check out one of the examples.

### Example 1\. Film B-roll footage with food

So let's add some b-roll to give it more context even if you have a master shot of yourself looking off frame alone.

##### Step1Write a script

Before making any video, the first step is to write a script for the whole video. If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.

Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.

##### Step2Shot a primary video

First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.

![primary footage of a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/primary-footage-of-a-video.gif)

As you can see that it's kind of boring for the audience, but we will make it more unique by implementing closer shots. For this, follow the last step:

##### Step3Make B-roll shots

Make closer shots of things which the character have to select and pick up. Check out two B-roll shots for the main video:

* First, make a closer shot of the object (Snacks) that the character is noticing prior.

![b roll footage number 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/b-roll-footage-number-1.jpg)

* Second, create more intimate footage of the second object (Banana) which the character will select and grab.

![b roll footage number 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/b-roll-footage-number-2.jpg)

##### Step4Edit both B-roll footages in Main Video

Now, in the last, insert the B-roll footage in between the primary video from the Filmora and get your results. Enjoy it with your viewers!

![final video after adding b roll footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-video-after-adding-b-roll-footage.gif)

Now experiment at home with more daily life activities and create all on Filmora. Check out one more example to create B-roll footage!

### Example 2\. Make B-roll shots with a cardboard

Try using readily accessible cardboard to create light effects in different shapes and give the film a fantastical place. These methods frequently produce artistic videos that transmit unique moods to viewers.

Only experienced photographers and videographers understand how to use these fundamental tricks to gain viewers into the photos.

The intriguing thing is that if the light is more shaped, it will more accurately reflect the image's background, setting, and context. Try it out!

##### Step1Cut the cardboard

You may shape the cardboard any way you desire. We'll experiment with this by cutting cardboard into the shape of window shades.

![make shapes of the cardboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/make-shapes-of-the-cardboard.jpg)

##### Step2Make B-roll footage

Create B-roll footage by moving the cardboard around the light source after giving it shape. The person appears to be seated close to the window and conveys aesthetic vibrancy.

![final result of b roll footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-result-of-b-roll-footage.jpg)

Before making any video, the first step is to write a script for the whole video. If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.

Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.

##### Step2Shot a primary video

First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.

As you can see that it's kind of boring for the audience, but we will make it more unique by implementing closer shots. For this, follow the last step:

##### Step3Make B-roll shots

Make closer shots of things which the character have to select and pick up. Check out two B-roll shots for the main video:

* First, make a closer shot of the object (Snacks) that the character is noticing prior.

Now experiment at home with more daily life activities and create all on Filmora. Check out one more example to create B-roll footage!

### Example 2\. Make B-roll shots with a cardboard

Try using readily accessible cardboard to create light effects in different shapes and give the film a fantastical place. These methods frequently produce artistic videos that transmit unique moods to viewers.

Only experienced photographers and videographers understand how to use these fundamental tricks to gain viewers into the photos.

The intriguing thing is that if the light is more shaped, it will more accurately reflect the image's background, setting, and context. Try it out!

##### Step1Cut the cardboard

You may shape the cardboard any way you desire. We'll experiment with this by cutting cardboard into the shape of window shades.

##### Step2Make B-roll footage

Create B-roll footage by moving the cardboard around the light source after giving it shape. The person appears to be seated close to the window and conveys aesthetic vibrancy.

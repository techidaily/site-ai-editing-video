* **Learning curve**: You need to compare the editing software options that you have to determine which one is complex to learn and which one is easy. This will save you the time and effort you would have spent downloading multiple products to test.
* **Quality**: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, and you need to choose the one that supports your video format.
* **Resources**: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor with all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.
* **Compatability**: Check whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you want to use. Consult the internet for compatibility by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.

## How to Make Coin Magic With Filmora

Do you want to become a magician in your videos? Now, everyone can look like a magician with the magic of editing. This article will show you how to do a cool coin trick in [Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 1: What is the filmmaking technique "Cutting on action"

Cutting on action is a technique the editors use to cut in the middle of an action to another shot that matches the first shot's action. Typically, the subject starts an action in one shot and continues the action in another, creating a smooth transition. For example, when you make the coin trick video, you need to cut on the tapping so it can trick the eyes, and the cut won't be noticeable.

![what is filmmaking technique](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-1.jpg)

## Part 2: Things You Need to Prepare for The Coin Magic Trick

![glass and coins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-2.jpg)

![set the phone on a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-3.jpg)

## Part 3: Start Filming

Step1 Firstly, you must show the coin and the bottom of the glass.

![show the coin and the bottom of the glass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-4.png)

Step2 After that, you need to hold the coin with the fingers part of one hand and tap down on the coin. Make sure it looks like the coin is going through straight to the glass.

![hold the coin with the fingers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-5.jpg)

Step3 You need someone else to drop the other coin from the top. Meanwhile, you are pretending to tap a coin on the glass. You don't need to worry about someone else hand in the frame. Since you can remove it easily with the masking feature in Filmora.

![drop the other coin from the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-6.jpg)

Step4 It would help if you had a second shot for a clean plate of the background. You can record background for 20 seconds.

![record background for 20 seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-7.jpg)

## Part 4: Bring the clips into Filmora 11

Step1 If you have not downloaded Filmora, you can visit filmora.wondershare.com to download Filmora's new version.

![download Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-8.jpg)

Step2 Drag and drop the clip onto the first track of the timeline.Afterward, move the playhead to the right and find the spot where you tapped the coin last time before your friend drops the other coin. Additionally, make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action and cut.

![drag and drop the clip onto the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-9.jpg)

Step3 Then move the playhead to the right and find the spot where your friend drops the coin while you tap without the coin in your hand. Make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action, and the position of your hand roughly matches that in the last cut and make a cut.

![move the playhead to the right](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-10.jpg)

Step4 Now you need to delete the middle part and play it back. Indeed, cutting on action is the key to creating the illusion that the action is continued without editing.

![delete the middle part](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-11.jpg)

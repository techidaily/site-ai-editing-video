4\. What should I do if the video is upside down after rotating it?

If the video is upside down after rotating it, you may have rotated it in the wrong direction. Try rotating it in the opposite direction and see if that fixes the issue. If not, you may need to use a third-party video editing software to rotate the video.

5\. Can I rotate a video without losing quality?

Rotating a video can sometimes result in a loss of quality, especially if the video is compressed or low-resolution. However, using a good video editing software can help minimize the loss of quality. Make sure to save the rotated video in the same format and resolution as the original file to avoid further loss of quality.

Unlike **Final Cut Pro's slow motion**, Wondershare Filmora is more straightforward to operate. Follow the step-by-step guide below to apply slow-motion effects to your video.

#### Method 1: Uniform Speed

If you want to adjust the speed and retain its high quality, use the uniform speed option. You can access this option by following the stepwise method below. Using the advanced features, you don’t need any other tool to ensure the video’s original worth:

##### Step 1Import Your Project and Start a New Project

After launching Filmora, head to its “New Project” option from the home screen. You will enter the main editing screen this way. Import your project in the media panel and then drag it to the timeline.

##### Step 2Explore Uniform Speed and Adjust the Speed

Go to your video in the timeline and right-click on it. Now, explore the “Uniform Speed” option and tap on it to get an editing panel at the right. From that panel, move the “Speed” slider to the right and get a slow-motion video preview. You can see the "Duration" of the video after slowing it down and adjusting it accordingly.

##### Step 3Use Advanced Features to Ensure Quality of Videos

Move down and toggle the “Reverse Speed” option if required. You can enable the “Maintain Pitch” and “Ripple Edit” options to enhance the video automatically. Lastly, extend the “AI Frame Interpolation” menu using its downward symbol and choose “Optical Flow.” It will ensure that the video will remain slow with high quality.

#### Method 2: Speed Ramping

This method aims to bring smooth transitions in slow-motion videos. Instead of an abrupt change, a gradual increase in speed can impose a professional look. So, there are the steps to access this feature and get a preview of smooth playback.

##### Step 1Discover the Speed Ramping Feature

Access the Speed Ramping option next to the “Uniform Speed” in the right-side editing panel. Alternatively, you can right-click on the video and look for the “Speed Ramping” option from the list.

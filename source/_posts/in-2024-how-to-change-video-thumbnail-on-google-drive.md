## How to Change Video Thumbnail on Google Drive

**What is a Google drive?**

“Google drive is a self-hosted cloud-based site that provides free space to store your files and pictures to share them with your friends and family”.

Google Drive is also used to promote businesses or websites. You can upload a video to Google Drive and embed the file in your blog or any other website.

**What is a Thumbnail?**

“A Thumbnail is a still image that acts as

a preview image of your video.”

A thumbnail is the first thing seen by the viewers while watching videos. It is the only thing that forces the viewer either to watch the video or not because it previews the video content. It is also shown in the search results. A thumbnail is just like the cover or title of a book. You will read a book by its cover. In the same way, a video is viewed by its thumbnail.

Google drive is also used for the promotion of websites and businesses. It does not offer to add a thumbnail or cover image like YouTube has the option to set and can change the thumbnail of the video. As we all know Google drive is not a streaming platform and has its own boundaries.

Normally, the google drive can generate a thumbnail from the video and uses the generated thumbnail ignoring the one you have uploaded. But on the other hand, if it cannot generate a thumbnail the uploaded thumbnail will be displayed. Usually, the default thumbnail may have weird facial expressions or may not be attractive for the viewers to open the video.

Here we are discussing a few alternatives to change the thumbnail of the video in Google drive.

Select a separate image to be housed in a separate column to set as a thumbnail image and then go into the **details, title,** and **Image settings.**

Do you want to make changes to the video? If yes, then it is important to understand the basic concepts of video aspect ratios. Moreover, you can determine the specifications using an aspect ratio editor online.

The formula to find an aspect ratio is: Width / Height

### Aspect Ratio Calculation Process

Calculating the aspect resolution is pretty straightforward. The steps mentioned below will help you to get the correct height for the edited image:

* Take the original height-for example, 2400 units.
* Take the actual width- for example, 3200 units.
* Then, divide the height by width- for example, 2400/3200=0.75.
* Multiply the result (quotient) by new expected width- for instance, 0.75\*600=450.
* The resulting figure is a new height.

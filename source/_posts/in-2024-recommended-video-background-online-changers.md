## Part 3\. How to trim YouTube videos on a desktop?

Using an online video trimmer has been one of the last options that anyone would consider, but due to the expensive software, they have turned out to be a friendly and easy approach to editing videos. But the online video trimmers still rank at the bottom of the list because they're unstable, and you can't save the project at any time. If the online program breaks down, all your effort will be wasted. But desktop programs such as Filmora will never make you encounter such problems unless you experience a technical glitch.

With the help of a variety of strong editing tools and [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), users may quickly and easily make outstanding videos. With Wondershare Filmora, anyone can learn how to be an excellent video editor, thanks to its wonderfully simple design.

**You can follow these easy steps to trim your video:**

Step1Click **"Import"** on the main windows and then select the desired video files from your computer to add video files to the Timeline for cutting. Movies can also be dropped directly into the Media Library.

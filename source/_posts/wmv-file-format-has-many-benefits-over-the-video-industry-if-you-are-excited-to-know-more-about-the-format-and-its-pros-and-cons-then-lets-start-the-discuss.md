## Part 5\. WMV VS. MP4: What's the Difference?

MP4 is far more popular than the WMV file format. The world is shifting on the internet; MP4 is widely used and loved online. On the other hand, WMV is popular with Windows users, along with DVD and Blu-ray collectors.

If we talk about the supported software for MP4 and WMV, MP4 has bigger support. WMV is supported by fewer video players and online video editing tools. On the contrary, MP4 is supported by all the video players available for both Windows and Mac users; along with that, every online tool also supports MP4 format for video editing.

Now the world demands quality. In terms of quality, MP4 has better quality than WMV. WMV has lost the battle of quality provision against WMV. MP4 is a larger file than WMV in terms of file size. It is less compressed than WMV format, but the compression gives WMV an advantage over MP4.

Having a compressed file format produces files of smaller size, which can be easily stored. Easy storage of video files makes WMV a better option in places where the quality of the video can be compromised.

#### 1\. How do you make text look good in Premiere Pro?

There are several steps you need to take to make text look good in Premiere Pro. First of all, the color of the text should be in contrast to the background. You can add a rectangle highlighter in the background. Experiment with font and text of the text. Apply a text effect from the different templates available. Customize the effect to get the desired result.

#### 2\. How do you add typing effects in Premiere?

Add your text to your video so that a text layer appears on the timeline. Animate the text Effects> Video Effects> Liner Wipe and double-click to get the typing effect. Tweak the parameters like transition completion, wipe angle, and others to smoothen out the animation. Draw a cursor icon using rectangle tool and animation it to move with the text using keyframes.

#### 3\. How do I open text effects controls in Premiere Pro?

Select the text layer from the timeline of the project. From the main menu, go to Windows> Effects Control option to open effect controls for text. Otherwise, you can directly go to Effects Control tab located below the menu bar after selecting your text layer.

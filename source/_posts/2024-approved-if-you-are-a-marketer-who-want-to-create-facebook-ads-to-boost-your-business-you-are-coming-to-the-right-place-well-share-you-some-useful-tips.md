## If You Are a Marketer Who Want to Create Facebook Ads to Boost Your Business, You Are Coming to the Right Place. We’ll Share You some Useful Tips to Start Your First FB Ads Campaign

Facebook ads can be an effective channel for reaching the right customers, but only if you have a strong strategy in place. If you are new to Facebook ads, don't rush into creating your first campaign without fully understanding the risks and rewards of advertising on Facebook.

![facebook ads campaign tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/facebook-ads-campaign-tips.jpg)

Before you launch your first Facebook ad campaign, here are six tips to keep in mind:

## Part1\. Define the purpose of your ad

This can be a long-form or short-form question. If a user is browsing Facebook and sees your ad, you want them to know why they should click on it. Is it an offer? If so, what are they getting in return? Is the ad simply a call to action? You may want to include a “Learn more” button that links back to your website so that users can learn more about whatever they need to know before taking the next steps.

There are 11 Facebook Ads campaign objectives to choose from, and you should choose the one that best aligns with your goals.

![create new fb campaign](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-new-fb-campaign.jpg)

Awareness:

* Brand awareness - Show your advertisements to individuals who are most likely to recall them.
* Reach - Show your ad to as many people as possible

Consideration:

* Traffic - Send people to your website or app
* Engagement - Increase the number of times people see and interact with your ad.
* App installs - Advertise to individuals who are more likely than others to download and use your app.
* Video views - Increase the number of times people see and interact with your video
* Lead generation - Use forms, calls, or chats to obtain information from people eager in your business.
* Messages - Get more people to message you on Facebook Messenger

Conversion:

* Conversions - Advertise to people who have a higher likelihood of taking action, such as buying something or calling you from your website.
* Catalog sales -Show your potential customers ads for items in your catalog that match their interests, so they are more likely to buy from you.
* Store traffic - This allows you to use your Facebook page as a marketing platform. If you want to run store traffic ads on Facebook, include your shop information there.

Whatever the case, make sure you have a clear goal from start to finish to understand what exactly it is you are trying to accomplish for any given campaign.

## Part2\. Know your target audience

Before you create any ads, it's important to define who will see them. You'll want to think carefully about the type of person who would be interested in what you're offering and how they would respond when they see the ad. If you can't answer these questions, it's time to start considering different audiences.

![know your target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg)

But how do we begin defining a target audience? To start, let's look at the different terms used by advertisers:

Customer: The person who has already bought from your company. For example, if you sell coffee makers on Amazon and have an existing customer base from those sales (customers), then this would be the most relevant term for you when deciding who should see specific ads for new products or services that may interest them based on past purchases or interests shown through other online activity such as browsing history or social media engagement with similar content/products/services.

Prospect: A lead that has expressed interest in buying something, but has not yet purchased anything from your company. A prospect does not necessarily mean someone has signed up for an email list or asked for more info; keeping leads fresh is just as important as nurturing prospects into customers later down the road so don't forget that part!

Now that you know who you are targeting, it's time to create an avatar for your target customer. An avatar is a fictional character that represents your target customer. This will help you to better understand their needs and wants, and it will also make it easier to create targeted ads.

![create an avatar for target customer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-an-avatar-for-target-customer.jpg)

There are a few different ways to create an avatar:

_1.) Customer profile:_ This is a simple way to gather information about your target customer. Start by creating a list of demographic information such as age, location, gender, education level, and income level. You can also include interests and behaviors, such as what they like to do for fun, what type of music they listen to, and what type of products they buy.

_2.) Persona:_ A persona is very similar to a customer profile, but it takes things a step further by giving each target customer a name and backstory. This can be helpful if you are targeting a specific niche audience.

_3.) Mind-map:_ If you want to get creative, you can create a mind-map of your target customer. This will allow you to brainstorm everything that you know about them and come up with new ideas.

Once you have created your avatar, make sure that you keep it in mind when creating your Facebook ad campaign. This will help to ensure that your ads are relevant and interesting to your target customer.

## Part3\. Prepare a decent image for your audience to click on

Images are the most important part of any ad. A good image will help your customers understand what it is that they're clicking on, and they may even want to share it with their friends. However, if your image is poor quality or irrelevant then, it won't do as well as it could have done.

You should start by picking a relevant image that shows off your product in the best light possible. If possible, try and get some type of testimonial from customers using your product so that other people can see how great your product really is!

![create decent image for fb ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-decent-image-for-fb-ads.jpg)

If you don't have good images available yet, don't worry! You can always hire a professional photographer who knows what kind of shots work best for advertising purposes but even if this isn't something that suits every business, there are still plenty of free resources out there too like Unsplash which offers high-quality stock photography under Creative Commons licenses under various conditions such as attribution when used commercially, so make sure whatever method you choose fits within these guidelines!

## Part4\. Practice Your copywriting skills

You can have the best-developed ad in the world, but if it doesn't have strong copywriting, your ads won't work as well. It's important to know what you're getting into before spending time and money on Facebook ads.

![practice copywriting skills fb ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/practice-copywriting-skills-fb-ads.jpg)

The following are just some of the ways you can improve your copywriting skills:

* Read other people's ads and see how they write their copy
* Read books about writing persuasive copy.

Try writing your own copy. Then have someone read it and give feedback on what they like and what they don't like about it. Try to learn from their suggestions.

There are also many different ways to write copy for a Facebook ad. Some people like to use specific formulas for their ads, such as: AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action). This formula was developed by an American businessman named Claude C. Hopkins in 1898 and is still widely used today. If you're not sure which method is best for you, it might be worth trying a few different ones. Have someone read your ad and give their opinion on which method was the most effective at convincing them that they should click on your ad.

You can also hire a copywriter to help you with your ad. However, if you don't have the budget for it at this point in time or just want to try writing your own first before hiring someone else, there are many different apps and websites that will help you to create an ad copy.

## Part5\. Decide what type of ad format will you use

It is a carousel ad, or single image/video ad, or a combination of both?

![choose ad type format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-ad-type-format.jpg)

If you are going to use a carousel ad, you need at least three images. If you're using a single image or video ads, then you only need one image or video.

As always, if your budget allows it, try to increase the number of ad sets that are running at once so as not to cannibalize each other's reach—it's better to have multiple ads winning than just one.

If you're running a single video ad for example and your budget is $100 per day, it's best practice to have to create multiple versions of this single video ad so that they don't cannibalize each other.

## Part6\. Plan your ad budget

You need to determine how much you're willing to spend on your Facebook ads. This will help you to create a budget and also to decide how often you want your ad to be shown.

![plan your fb ad budget](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/plan-your-fb-ad-budget.jpg)

The average Facebook ad spends between $5 and $10 per day. However, this can vary depending on the type of product or service that you're promoting, as well as the size of your target audience.

If you have a large target audience, it might be worth increasing your ad budget so that your ad is seen by more people. On the other hand, if you have a smaller target audience, you might want to decrease your ad budget so that you don't spend too much money on ads that aren't being seen by as many people.

It's also important to consider how often you want your ad to be shown. If you want your ad to be seen by as many people as possible, it's best to have it shown more than once. However, if you only want your ad to be shown to a select group of people, it's best to have it shown less often.

Both of these factors will help you to determine your Facebook ad spend.

## The Bottom Line

If you're ready to get started with Facebook ads, we encourage you to put these tips into practice. I believe that they will help you make the most of your budget and achieve your goals, whether they be brand awareness, lead generation or sales.

Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you've come to the right place.

Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.

They aren't exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we've put together this guide to take you through the steps. We'll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you've shot it.

Let’s get started.

## What Is A Time Lapse Video?

In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.

When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.

Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.

## How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?

### Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video

Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what's more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.

When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn't move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.

Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:

#### 1\. Sunset/Sunrise

These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.

#### 2\. Clouds

Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!

#### 3\. Starry sky

Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.

#### 4\. Flowers

Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!

#### 5\. Season changing

The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don't have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.

#### 6\. Cars or Pedestrians

If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.

#### 7\. Cooking dinner

Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It's easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!

#### 8\. DIY projects

Are you building something? Whether it's a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.

#### 9\. Construction work in progress

If you're watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It's hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it's finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.

#### 10\. A fun art project

Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.

### Steps to shoot a time-lapse video

Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.

The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.

If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.

#### 1\. Decide on a subject

The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.

#### 2\. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod

While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.

_Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don't want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots._

#### 3\. Set the camera focus

Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.

#### 4\. Set your exposure settings

Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.

#### 5\. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed

For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames/photos (30 seconds x 24 fps = 720 frames).

#### 6\. Import and stitch together

Once you’ve captured the images, import them into a video editing software, stitch them together, and perform necessary editing.

## How to Edit The Time Lapse on iPhone?

Now that you’ve recorded a time-lapse video, you might watch it and think it’s slower or faster than you want it to be. Fortunately, you can speed up and slow down the time lapse video on iPhone using iMovie.

Let’s see how to slow down time lapse on iPhone iMovie.

### 1\. Speed up The Time Lapse on iPhone

So you've taken a time lapse video on your iPhone and now you're trying to get it to speed up in iMovie but it looks a little jumpy or there is too much footage. Here's how to do it in iMovie for iOS.

* Launch iMovie on your iPhone and start a new project to speed up the captured time-lapse video.
* Now, tap the **plus sign** visible at the start of the Projects screen, then select **Movie**.

![tap the plus button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/1-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* From the next window, find and select the recorded time-lapse video you want to speed up.

![tap Movie in the New Project window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/2-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Tap **Create Movie** button at the center-bottom of the screen.

![tap Create Movie at the bottom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Now move the playhead to the start of the timeline and tap to select the video. At this point, you’ll see the timeline highlighted in yellow color.
* Look at the bottom of the screen and you’ll find the **Speed** icon. Tap the Speed icon and a **sliding bar** will appear with tortoise on its left side and hare on the right side.

![tap the Speed icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* To speed up the time-lapse video, move the slider to the **right side** and you’ll see the duration of the video reduced, indicating time-lapse video has been sped up.

![Move the slider forward to increase speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/5-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Now click the **Play** button to preview and then tap **Done**.

Once you’ve increased the speed of time-lapse video, you can share it and post it where you want.

### 2\. Slow Down The Time Lapse on iPhone

Just like you can speed up the time-lapse video on an iPhone, iMovie lets you slow down the time-lapse video.

Here’s how you can do it:

* Launch iMovie on your iPhone and start a new project to speed up the captured time-lapse video.
* Now, tap the **plus sign** visible at the start of the Projects screen, then select **Movie**.

![tap the plus button in the Projects screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/6-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* From the next window, find and select your recorded time-lapse video you want to speed up.

![Select Movie in the New Project screen ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/7-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Tap **Create Movie** button at the center-bottom of the screen.

![tap Create Movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/8-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Now move the playhead to the start of the timeline and tap to select the video. At this point, you’ll see the timeline highlighted in yellow color.
* Look at the bottom of the screen and you’ll find the **Speed** icon. Tap the Speed icon and a **sliding bar** will appear with tortoise on its left side and hare on the right side.

![tap the Speed icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/9-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* To slow down the time-lapse video, move the slider to the **left side** and you’ll see the duration of the video increased, indicating time-lapse video has been slowed down.

![Move the slider backward to slow down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Now click the **Play** button to preview and then tap **Done**.

## Advanced Software: Edit A Time Lapse Video in Wondershare Filmora

If you have professionally captured RAW images of the time-lapse video, you need to use advanced software to stitch them together. That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.

Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.

If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.

Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.

### Speed up your time-lapse video

Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.

When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.

Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.

Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:

* Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.
* Launch Filmora and click the **New project** button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.

![tap the New Project button and open the Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/11-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Once imported, drag the file to the timeline.

![drag the media file to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/12-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Click the **Speed** icon and select the **Fast** option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.

![tap the Speed button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/13-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Save the file and use it the way you want.

### Slow down your time-lapse video

As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.

The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.

You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the **Fast** option choose **Slow** when you’re at step 4.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It's easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.

Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don't be afraid to create something unique and experimental.

There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.

#### 4\. Flowers

Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!

#### 5\. Season changing

The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don't have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.

#### 6\. Cars or Pedestrians

If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.

#### 7\. Cooking dinner

Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It's easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!

#### 8\. DIY projects

Are you building something? Whether it's a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.

#### 9\. Construction work in progress

If you're watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It's hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it's finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.

#### 10\. A fun art project

Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.

### Steps to shoot a time-lapse video

Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.

The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.

If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.

#### 1\. Decide on a subject

The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.

#### 2\. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod

While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.

_Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don't want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots._

#### 3\. Set the camera focus

Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.

#### 4\. Set your exposure settings

Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.

#### 5\. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed

For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames/photos (30 seconds x 24 fps = 720 frames).

#### 6\. Import and stitch together

Once you’ve captured the images, import them into a video editing software, stitch them together, and perform necessary editing.

## How to Edit The Time Lapse on iPhone?

## Advanced Software: Edit A Time Lapse Video in Wondershare Filmora

If you have professionally captured RAW images of the time-lapse video, you need to use advanced software to stitch them together. That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.

Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.

If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.

Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.

### Speed up your time-lapse video

Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.

When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.

Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.

Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:

* Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.
* Launch Filmora and click the **New project** button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.

![tap the New Project button and open the Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/11-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Once imported, drag the file to the timeline.

![drag the media file to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/12-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Click the **Speed** icon and select the **Fast** option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.

![tap the Speed button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/13-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Save the file and use it the way you want.

### Slow down your time-lapse video

As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.

The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.

You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the **Fast** option choose **Slow** when you’re at step 4.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It's easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.

Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don't be afraid to create something unique and experimental.

Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you've come to the right place.

Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.

They aren't exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we've put together this guide to take you through the steps. We'll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you've shot it.

Let’s get started.

## What Is A Time Lapse Video?

In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.

When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.

Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.

## How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?

### Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video

Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what's more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.

When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn't move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.

Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:

#### 1\. Sunset/Sunrise

These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.

#### 2\. Clouds

Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!

#### 3\. Starry sky

Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.

#### 4\. Flowers

Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!

The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don't have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.

#### 6\. Cars or Pedestrians

If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.

#### 7\. Cooking dinner

Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It's easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!

#### 8\. DIY projects

Are you building something? Whether it's a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.

#### 9\. Construction work in progress

If you're watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It's hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it's finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.

#### 10\. A fun art project

Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.

### Steps to shoot a time-lapse video

Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.

The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.

If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.

#### 1\. Decide on a subject

The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.

#### 2\. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod

While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.

_Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don't want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots._

#### 3\. Set the camera focus

Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.

#### 4\. Set your exposure settings

Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.

#### 5\. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed

For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames/photos (30 seconds x 24 fps = 720 frames).

#### 6\. Import and stitch together

Once you’ve captured the images, import them into a video editing software, stitch them together, and perform necessary editing.

## How to Edit The Time Lapse on iPhone?

Now that you’ve recorded a time-lapse video, you might watch it and think it’s slower or faster than you want it to be. Fortunately, you can speed up and slow down the time lapse video on iPhone using iMovie.

Let’s see how to slow down time lapse on iPhone iMovie.

### 1\. Speed up The Time Lapse on iPhone

So you've taken a time lapse video on your iPhone and now you're trying to get it to speed up in iMovie but it looks a little jumpy or there is too much footage. Here's how to do it in iMovie for iOS.

* Launch iMovie on your iPhone and start a new project to speed up the captured time-lapse video.
* Now, tap the **plus sign** visible at the start of the Projects screen, then select **Movie**.

![tap the plus button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/1-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* From the next window, find and select the recorded time-lapse video you want to speed up.

![tap Movie in the New Project window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/2-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

## Advanced Software: Edit A Time Lapse Video in Wondershare Filmora

If you have professionally captured RAW images of the time-lapse video, you need to use advanced software to stitch them together. That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.

Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.

If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.

Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.

### Speed up your time-lapse video

Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.

When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.

Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.

Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:

* Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.
* Launch Filmora and click the **New project** button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.

![tap the New Project button and open the Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/11-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Once imported, drag the file to the timeline.

![drag the media file to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/12-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Click the **Speed** icon and select the **Fast** option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.

![tap the Speed button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/13-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Save the file and use it the way you want.

### Slow down your time-lapse video

As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.

The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.

You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the **Fast** option choose **Slow** when you’re at step 4.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It's easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.

Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don't be afraid to create something unique and experimental.

## Best 16 Motion Blur Apps for Videos & Photos

The blur observed in moving objects captured through the camera is called the motion blur effect. This, in particular, occurs due to the movement of the camera, subject, or both elements combined. People observe this effect in their real life through their eyes; thus, the motion blur effect is put into practice to give the clip or photo a touch of reality.

It is essentially used to display the message of speed or show the fast progression of time. Any object moving through a fast motion can be accompanied by the motion blur effect. There are many applications available to cater to this purpose. In this article, we will recommend some top-notch **motion blur apps** that will help you achieve this feat in no time.

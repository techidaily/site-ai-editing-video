### Key Features Marking Filmora’s Greatness

Filmora is proven to be the easiest software with the most powerful editing features. As proof, you can read the main features of Filmora to comprehend its functionalities better.

#### 1\. [Speed Ramping](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Create a unique cinematic effect in your video by adjusting keyframes. Filmora offers speed ramping features to bring a smooth transition in slow-motion or fast motions. In speed ramping, you get 6 templates, such as bullet time, montage, and jumper. Using those templates, you don't need to manually adjust keyframes for speed ramping. Also, you can retain the original pitch of the audio after changing the speed.

#### 2\. [AI Copilot Editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

To boost productivity, Filmora provides an AI Copilot editor option. It saves time that could be wasted searching for some feature or making the editing perfect. Users can ask anything to copilot in natural language. They can take help from an already existing question in the copilot editors. This feature will guide you toward practical actions through navigation buttons.

#### 3\. [AI Music Generator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Who else is fed up with finding the perfect music for Vlog? Commonly, you didn’t find a video of exact length and mood. Thus, Filmora enables you to generate a soundtrack according to your mood and video length. Using it, you just have to prompt with the number of tracks, mood, and length. The AI-generated music will not require copyrights, so you can use it freely anywhere.

#### 4\. [AI Image](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Have you ever heard that any video editor can convert your text prompts into images? Filmora is offering this option, especially for people who are struggling to get their desired image. For this purpose, they need to describe images in simple language. Afterward, they are required to pick one style for accurate results.

#### 5\. [AI Copywriting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Do you have a deadline for script submission, but it is not ready yet? Leave this headache to Filmora’s AI copywriting feature, which aims to produce engaging scripts. With ChatGPT integration, it can generate YouTube titles and descriptions. Furthermore, you can ask AI to convert your script into an appealing video.

## Conclusion

To summarize, slowing down is the ultimate solution to retain the viewer’s attention. In this article, you have seen the top-notch platforms for **slow-motion GIFs**. They are not enough for remarkable videos because of the limited speed adjustment options. So, using Filmora remains the best option in providing easier ways to customize the speed of GIFs.

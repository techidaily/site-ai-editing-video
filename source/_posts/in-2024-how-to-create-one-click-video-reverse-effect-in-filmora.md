## How to Create One Click Video Reverse Effect in Filmora

All great video editors use phenomenal video effects in their videos. One of the most professional effects is the reverse video effect. This unique effect is always challenging for the makers to shoot and portray on the screen flawlessly.

At the same time, it is intriguing and always draws the audience's attention. In this article, you will learn to shoot and edit the video for reverse effects using Filmora. But first, we will learn what does video reverse effect mean. So let us get into this!

## Part 1\. What Is Video Reverse Effect?

It is a special video effect in which a motion of things starts in the backward direction. This unique effect is used to intrigue the audience.

For example, if a bullet is fired from a gun. With the reverse effect, you can rewind the footage, and the shot goes back into the gun. So today, you can easily rewind fast action scenes and get a wow reaction from the audience.

### Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films

**1- Demolition of a Wall (1896)**

Filmmakers first used this striking effect in 1896 in a 90 seconds film, "Demolition of a wall." Louis Lumiere was the one who made that video. Below is shown an image from the film.

![demolition of a wall 1896](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-1.png)

**2- Tenet (2020)**

It is a viral film by Christopher Nolan, which was a great success. He explained the concept of reverse entropy, in which you start moving back chronologically in time instead of forward. This concept is all shown through this special video reverse effect. Unfortunately, the audience had difficulty digesting this unique concept, which generated an awful response.

![tenet 2020](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-2.png)

## Part 2\. How To Shoot Video Reverse Effect?

The reverse effect is unique, so special attention should be paid while filming a video. This section will cover some of the crucial prerequisites to film a video.

### Steady Camera

It would be best to have your camera placed on a steady surface or mounted on a tripod stand to lock the focus. We will split the area and perform different tasks to make it look smooth. The audience will not get the idea that you completed the tasks separately. And it helps in the editing process as well.

![keep your camera steady](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-3.png)

### A Spacious Area

You will need a spacious area in which you will perform different tasks. Make sure your camera stands still while shooting all the frames of video. In an ample space, it becomes easier to do movements freely. It also helps prevent glitches in the final product.

### Splitting of Area into Portions

Now you have to split your area into portions. Each task is in its part of the frame, and actions in one frame should not pass over into another. You will do one activity per portion. It makes the editing process a lot easier. Finally, we get all three videos to merge and make it look like a single video.

**Potential Advantages**

Choosing the Blender 3D design suite for dimensional and motion graphic editing, you are entitled to benefit from the following advantages:

### 01A Free Graphic Suite

Almost every software user has the obvious habit of prioritizing financial equity before all other program credibility. However, you should be relieved to realize that the Blender 3D Suite is available to you without a price tag. Loyal users of the software claim the product to outshine its priced counterparts in terms of features and responsive flexibility.

If you are at the shore of graphic design and 3D modeling, there’s absolutely no better software to jump with, in the creation pool. Talking of the concerns of long term free usage and hidden feature blocking pay walls, there’s no cause to worry.

T5her biggest advantage of this rendering engine happens to be its working speed. While it does not require you wait for tedious rendering durations, you can additionally escape individual frame renders.

The Cycles is a physical, path tracing render engine, using light rays to interpret design looks. Compatible to GPU and CPU rendering, this one is a bit slow, but delivers a much precise image than Eevee.

## Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender

Blender is a top class graphic modulation tool; you can use to play with your editing creativity to your heart’s content, catering to a variety of design requirements, while adhering to a distinguished professional outlook. If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.

When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:

**Transparent BSDF Node**

When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.

Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:

**Step 1:**

Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.

**Step 2:**

To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.

**Step 3:**

Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.

**Step 4:**

Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:

**●** Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Mix Shader output to the Surface input

This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.

## Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender

Blender is a top class graphic modulation tool; you can use to play with your editing creativity to your heart’s content, catering to a variety of design requirements, while adhering to a distinguished professional outlook. If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.

When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:

**Transparent BSDF Node**

When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.

Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:

**Step 1:**

Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.

**Step 2:**

To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.

**Step 3:**

Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.

**Step 4:**

Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:

**●** Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Mix Shader output to the Surface input

This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.

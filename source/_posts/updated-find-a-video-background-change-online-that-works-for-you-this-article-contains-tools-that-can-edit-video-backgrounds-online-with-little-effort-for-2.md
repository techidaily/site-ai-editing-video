## How To Synchronize Your Audio And Videos Properly?

Video quality and engagement are prone to impact badly if your audio is not synchronized with the video. This can happen because of technical issues or frame rate mismatches. In case you somehow get unsynchronized audio in the video, you need to use a reliable video editor to cater to this issue. To help you with this issue, this article will provide the best-in-class video editor named Wondershare Filmora.

The key features and the [smooth and sleek interface](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) show that you will have optimized audio synchronization with videos. Along with the auto beat sync feature, we will also discuss some online alternatives that will assist you in syncing audio while online.

## Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?

Audio and video synchronization is important for presenting a good quality viewing experience. Here are the main reasons you shouldn’t neglect this in your audio and video.

### Lip Sync and Narrative Flow

Synchronizing audio and video is crucial to maintaining the film's narrative flow. Well-synchronized audio and video offer a very smooth experience to the viewers. If the lips and dialogue flow are not well maintained, it can cause distraction in the storytelling. As a result, the real message won't be conveyed to the viewers.

### Viewer Engagement

Do you wish to ensure that your viewers pay full attention to your video and that your message is well conveyed? Your video quality and sound matter the most for the best experience. When the audio and video are well-synced, the viewers pay attention to the content. They are not distracted due to the bad quality of the video.

### Value of Quality Production

A high-quality video with perfect sound quality and proper syncing builds a good perception. If the video quality is bad or does not have proper sync, it can leave a bad impression. Therefore, to enhance the impact of these emotional and dramatic effects, it is imperative to focus on these core things.

### Professionalism and Quality

To make your viewer experience outstanding, focus on paying attention to details. A good quality video represents your professionalism and the standards of your production. When it is synchronized, the viewer will always see this as a high-quality creation.

## Does Windows 10 have built-in video editing software?

The answer is yes. Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn't work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.

You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You'll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.

Some people say that windows video editor has a very simple interface and it only has very basic features. In this case, having something is more important than not having anything at all. Also, you should keep in mind that not everyone needs a fully-fledged [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Some people have to do just basic tasks like trimming a video and increasing the brightness of a video. It is not feasible for them to purchase expensive video editing software for that purpose. So the Windows 10 video editor is the best in this case.

## How To Brighten A Video In Windows 10 Easily

This article will discuss two different methods using which you can easily brighten your videos in Windows 10\. So, without wasting any more time, let's get started.

### 1\. Using Filmora to brighten a video in Windows 10

You may think that all video editing software is created equal, but that's where you're wrong. The best video editor for your needs is drastically different depending on what you want to do with the end product. Some people want a quick way to make a trailer or showcase their products, and others want to put together an amateur movie.

Filmora is one of the best video editing software for Windows that can improve or fix your dark videos. Filmora is an all-in-one video editor for Windows and Mac. With Filmora, you can easily edit videos and make simple videos with transitions and effects, and you can give any video a professional touch. It's a great piece of software that works incredibly smoothly. Filmora is an attractive and easy-to-use application that will give your video the final polish it needs. If you've ever had a video that looked too dark to use, there are ways to fix it aside from taking an entirely new video.

If you’ve ever had a video that looked too dark to use, then you can easily brighten it up using Filmora. Just follow the steps given below:

### Step 1

First of all, make sure that you have installed the latest version of Filmora on your computer. If you haven't already installed it, then you can download it easily from the official website of Wondershare.

### Step 2

Upon starting Wondershare Filmora, click the "Import" button. The import media item window will open and show you all the files on your computer. The program will now display a thumbnail of your selected video in its media area. Drag the video from the media library and drop it into the Filmora timeline.

### Step 3

You can change how the clip looks with the Rotate, Flip, Scale, and Position settings in the Video tab. When you select the Color tab, you will be presented with the White Balance, Tone, and 3D LUT options.

### Step 4

You can increase the brightness of the video by dragging the Brightness slider in the Tone option to the right. Click the spacebar to play the video to see the real-time result. The video will appear brighter as a result of your operation. Repeat the previous step if the video remains dark. You will see a brighter video each time you increase its brightness and contrast.

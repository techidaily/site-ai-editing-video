## Enhance Your Video Color Accuracy with Video Scopes

All video editors have been there. You edit and color-correct your video project only to find out that the final product is not what you expected. The contract and colors dramatically shift when viewed on a different device. In most cases, this is caused by improperly calibrated monitors, but it could also be your eyes playing tricks on you. **Video scopes** help in preventing this problem ensuring that the color in your video is consistent across devices. With video editing scope, you get the exact representation of the elements that make up your image, including lightness and color values. In this article, we explain what video scopes are and how you can use them in your editing projects.

## **Part 1\. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them**

When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.

![video scopes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-1.JPG)

Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:

* **Increased Accuracy**: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments
* **Reliability**: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.
* **Professional Editing**: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.
* **Matching Color Between Shots**: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.

Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.

## **Part 2\. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones**

Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:

* [Waveform Scopes](#scope1)
* [Histogram](#scope2)
* [RGB Parade](#scope3)
* [Vector Scopes](#scope4)

### **1\. Waveform Scopes**

Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-2.JPG)

### **2\. Histogram**

The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0\. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-3.JPG)

### **3\. RGB Parade**

This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.

![rgb parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-4.JPG)

### **4\. Vector Scopes**

This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.

Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:

* **Increased Accuracy**: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments
* **Reliability**: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.
* **Professional Editing**: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.
* **Matching Color Between Shots**: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.

Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.

## **Part 2\. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones**

Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:

* [Waveform Scopes](#scope1)
* [Histogram](#scope2)
* [RGB Parade](#scope3)
* [Vector Scopes](#scope4)

### **1\. Waveform Scopes**

Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-2.JPG)

### **2\. Histogram**

The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0\. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-3.JPG)

### **3\. RGB Parade**

This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.

![rgb parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-4.JPG)

### **4\. Vector Scopes**

This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.

The four video scopes offered by Filmora allow you to achieve specific color adjustments in your video projects. Let’s have a look at how each can be used in video editing.

#### **1\. Parade RGB**

The parade RGB video scope is used to change the color channel of your visual images from RBG to YCbCr or YRGB. It displays the red, green, and blue channels of the video signal, which can be helpful when you are identifying areas of the video that are too dark or too bright. You can also use the parade to check the color balance of the video.

![parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-7.JPG)

#### **2\. Waveform**

The Waveform video scope in Filmora is used to adjust the color channels of your images or videos in different ways. It displays the brightness of the video signal, allowing you to heck the contrast level.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-8.JPG)

#### **3\. Vectorscope**

The vectorscope helps to identify and adjust the skin tone of your subjects. It displays the color saturation of the video signal, helping you identify areas that are too saturated or desaturated. This way, you can easily check the skin tones in the video.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-9.JPG)

## How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

A wedding is one of the exciting parts that will happen in your life. It’s not that easy to plan a wedding, there’s a lot to be consider like wedding dress, food, venue, videographer etc. Everyone wants the best for their wedding and this includes videos that will record and capture important aspects of the event for years to come.

It’s probably hard to fast-forward your imagination ahead to see what you’ll be like in a decade, but if you and your spouse have your own children, as they grow it can be very special to be able to share your special memories with them, while you can certainly describe the flower archway where you exchange vows and tell them about the wedding care adorned with fresh flowers, your words can’t compare to the joy you’ll feel when you can show all of this first hand through your wedding video.

In this article will talk about how much does wedding videographer cost, how important to have your wedding day covered by the professional videographer and tips on how to save money in planning a wedding, because in your wedding day you want every moment that happens on that day will be captured.

* [Why need to hire a videographer on wedding day](#part3)

## How much a wedding videographer costs

Hiring a photographer for your wedding day is likely a given, but you might be wondering about the cost to hire a videographer and if it’s worth the extra expense.

Keep in mind that the average cost of a wedding videographer will largely depend on where you live, how many hours of coverage you want the videographer to capture, and how experienced the professional is. The longer they

’ve been in the business, the more likely the cost will increase.

It is recommended that you start with a standard package and customised it from there to make sure all your bases are covered. You can often get a better bargain this way.

Peak wedding season may also affect the cost some vendors, making coverage from June through December a bit pricier and harder to secure. The range can often run between $1000 and $1,500

Nationwide or as much as $12,500 for a luxury shoot that turns you into a celebrity wedding coverage.

![wedding coverage image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wedding-coverage-image.jpg)

### What include in the packages

Videographers, like wedding photographers, will have a variety of wedding packages for you to choose from.

Here’s what you can expect to see in a basic package

* Three-to-five-minute highlight video
* A 20–30-minute full wedding video with wedding ceremony and speeches
* Two cinematographers
* An assistant to the videographer

### There are also extra. Some videographer offers extras such as

* **Drone footage**– Drones are popular, especially at destination weddings. They have the ability to film hundreds of feet in the air which also makes your wedding video more unique. The extra equipment needed for this can cost you anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000
* **Travel**– Just because you’re getting married in a far-off place doesn’t mean you can’t have your dream videographer. Just be prepared to pay for their travel. You will likely pay for their accommodations, meals, and travel
* **Extra edits**– Videographers spend hours editing your final wedding video, so if you request any additional edits, it’s likely going to cost you
* **Filming before and after the wedding**– Whether your wedding is a weekend long affair or you host a brunch for your friends and family the day of the wedding, filming these moments is going to be additional cost. Discuss plans with your videographer as soon as possible so they can check their availability and they can give you a total for a wedding budget
* **Tipping**– tips are always welcomed even if they’re not expected. Your videographer puts in a lot of time and effort into capturing the beauty of the day, so any gesture of your appreciation will be welcomed.

And know what additional time can cost as much as $200-$500 per half hour, which pays for the videographer’s and assistant time, time spent editing additional footage, and video cards.

These included highlights and wedding videos will be professionally edited and they will also be set to music and delivered to you either via USB or through an online platform.

Typical videography prices also depend on the package you choose during the wedding planning process. Of course, you’re paying for a certain number of hours of coverage on your wedding day, but the post production editing process is even more time consuming and costly. While most videographers will produce an edited wedding movie, some may offer multiple clips at different lengths, like a wedding trailer for social media and a longer cinematic feature. Others might also be willing to give you the raw footage for your own personal use. Be sure to read your contract before making any final decisions so you know exactly what to get after the wedding day.

This one might sound strange. But the most experienced wedding videographer’s typically charge more than the going market rate. Price is a good way to tell who is the longest standing wedding videographer in an area. As the adage goes...you get what you pay for

## Tips on saving money on wedding videographer

While you would need a professional videographer for your wedding and this does cost quite a penny, there are a few tips you could employ in saving on videography costs.

**Time**

As mentioned before, the more time the videographer spends at your event the more it would cost. Therefore, if you are looking to minimize the average cost of a wedding videographer, you could have him stay for only the most important aspects of the wedding. You could skip the pre-wedding prep part and also the last part of the reception. Because everyone now has mobile phone and can tag you what they captured on your social media. You can also use a hashtag where your friends can tag all of your wedding photo captured by them.

**No extras**

Such extras as cinematic effects, drone footage, personalised packaging and extra coppies of the finished product all add up in cost. Leaving extras out will go a long way uncutting costs.

**No editing**

Since post-production is the most time-consuming aspect, accepting the raw footage instead of an edited one would definitely cost less. You could choose to do the editing much later if desired.

You can also do your own editing, it’s also different from the feeling of editing your own wedding footage, because you can actually see the raw footage and personalised the editing.

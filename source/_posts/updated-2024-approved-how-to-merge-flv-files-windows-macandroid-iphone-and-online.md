## Before & After Editing Trick | Wondershare Filmora Tutorial

How do travel vloggers instantly grab everyone's attention with their magical content? The unique animation preset is the answer. Video makers use them to morph video clips into scenic views that make viewers' jaws drop in awe. Also, these edits can cover up any flaws made during the production of the original video clip. Isn’t it cool?

You might be wondering how to add these effects to the video. Keep reading to discover some of the simplest effects that are bound to add soul to your content. Before diving into the details, let’s first understand these effects.

## Part 1\. What are the before/after effects?

After-effects are visual effects that are used to enhance the aesthetic appeal of videos. You might have encountered these effects several times during watching YouTube videos or movies. These transitions make the videos more appealing to the audience.

In films, for example, the dissolve effect is employed to signify a time change. It informs viewers that there is a time difference between the two shots. You can see how this effect is used to dissolve one scene into another in the video clip mentioned below.

![dissolve effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-1.gif)

The history of after-effects can be traced back to 1993\. These effects enabled the crew to mix 3D and 2D images to produce virtual dinosaur motion visuals in the Jurassic Park film, which we all love. Now that you have a fundamental understanding of the origins of after-effects, let's take a look at where they might be applied!

## Part 2\. Where can you use these before/after effects?

If you are a fan of fiction movies, then you must have noticed that some of their scenes though fake, look so realistic that they blow our minds. And now you might have an idea of how these shots are created!

Whether it be shooting a movie or a commercial, these transitions have the power to make our content irresistible. Once you are familiar with the purpose of these after-effects, it’s time to show you how you can edit your videos using these effects.

## Part 3\. How to edit your videos using before/after effects?

If you're new to editing and don't know much about video graphics, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor is the finest platform for you. It is not only easier to use but also more entertaining than other online video editors. Filmora is a free video editor that is accessible for both Windows and macOS.

### Steps for installing the Filmora video editor

To install the Filmora video editor, follow these steps

Step1 Go to the official site of Filmora.

Step2 Click on the download button.

Step3 Install the application on your PC.

Step4 Now, you can use the Filmora video editor to beautify your content.

Now, let's explore some of the coolest transition effects that you can use in your videos for before and after comparison.

## Part 4\. Filmora's top three transition effects for beginners

Wondershare Filmora can help video editors achieve their goals in the most basic and economical fashion. The best three transition effects that may completely transform your videos are shown below.

### Wipe Effect

Wipe transition is used to produce an apparent transformation to videos with similar frames for the before/after comparison. Travel vloggers mostly use this effect to create a retro vibe in their videos. This transition is frequently used in movies to demonstrate the influence of time on any place.

The wipe effect's fundamental goal is to transition from one shot into another via a sliding animation, giving the video an elegant vibe. For instance, we can use the wipe effect to convert the raw film to colored corrected footage.

#### Steps to apply the Wipe effect

Step1 Drag and drop the video clip 'before color correction' onto the timeline's first video track.

![drag and drop the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-2.jpg)

Step2 Then, drag and drop the color-corrected video clip on the second video track. Ensure that the clips are piled on top of one another so they may all be played simultaneously. It will make it easier for us to trim the footage.

![drag and drop the color-corrected video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-3.jpg)

Step3 Place the play head where we want the transformation to begin. Then trim the second clip.

![place the play](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-4.jpg)

Step4 Go to the Transitions window and select "Erase slide." Drag the transition to the start of the second video clip. Then, double-click the transition on the timeline to open the settings box.

![go to the transitions window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-5.jpg)

Step5 Adjust the length of the "Erase slide." Let's see how it turns out!

![adjust the length of the erase slide](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-6.gif)

### Dissolve Effect

The dissolve effect allows us to shift from one shot to another by using slow block dissolution. It gives the impression that one scene is being morphed into another. And, it is frequently used in documentaries.

We may utilize the dissolve transition to display the differences between two video segments more naturally. To explain the objective of the dissolve effect, we used two clips of the same place shot at separate times. The first film is current, but the second is from the same place but was taken a few years back.

**Steps to apply the Dissolve effect**

Step1 Drag and drop the first video clip onto the timeline's first video track.

![drag and drop the first video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-7.jpg)

Step2 Then, on the second video track, drag and drop the second video clip. Make sure the start of the second clip is where you want the transition to begin.

![drag and drop the second video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-8.jpg)

Step3 Then Go to the Transitions window and choose the "Dissolve" effect.

![choose the dissolve effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-9.jpg)

Step4 Drag the transition to the start of the second video clip.

![drag the transition to the start of the second video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-10.jpg)

Step5 Then, on the timeline, double-click the transition to open the settings box. If necessary, adjust the duration of the "Dissolve " effect as needed.

![double-click the transition to open the settings box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-11.jpg)

You can see how it looks in the image below. If we play the timeline, we can watch the green court convert into the old basketball court. However, the two visuals don't truly match each other during the transformation.

##### Steps to adjust the frames of the clips

Step1 We may fix it by adjusting the location and scale of the clips.

Step2 Move the play head to the transition section to watch both video segments.

Step3 To open the settings window, double-click on the first video.

Step4 Find the transform section and scale it to 110%.

Step5 Then, move the first video's frame to match the second video's placement. We may notice a more natural transition when we replay the timeline.

### Split Screen Effect

The split-screen technique first appeared in the film "The Queen of Spades," which was released in 1949\. It depicted a man suffering from a psychological illness. The split-screen effect was used to demonstrate the contrast between reality and his hallucinations. It made the viewer more aware of what was actually happening in the film.

![split screen effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-12.jpg)

Since then, the split screen has been used as the simplest technique to demonstrate the before/after comparison. This effect is also ideal for emphasizing the changes in only one section of the video.

Because the split screen effect does not display the whole frame of the video clips, you may eliminate the top and bottom bars of the video clips using this effect.

**How to apply a split screen effect?**

Step1 Find "Split Screen1" in the window by clicking "Split Screen."

Step2 Drag it over to the timeline.

Step3 You'll see the split-screen template in the preview box when you double-click it.

![split-screen template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-13.jpg)

Step4 Drag the two video clips you wish to compare to the template's left and right sides.

![drag the two video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-14.gif)

Step5 If necessary, you may also adjust the location of the videos in the preview clip.

Step6 Finally, uncheck the option labeled "allow split screen animation."

![uncheck the option labeled allow split screen animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-15.gif)

Step7 All of the steps for the before/after split screen are now complete.

Step8 Let's wait and see how it turns out!

![split screen are complete](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-trick-16.gif)

Successful YouTuber

## 1\. Understand 'Success' Means

YouTube's success is based on the premise that all visitors need the same thing. Search, find, and leave as fast as possible. Kind of like a store. But YouTube visitors have much more diverse needs than you might think. Some come to watch short clips of cats doing silly things, others to view TV shows or how to learn an instrument, cooking, maintain a car, and so much more.

The way your success is measured is by the number of viewers you get onto your channel. No matter what kind of content you upload, whether it's about music, education, when you turn viewers into subscribers, dedicated fans, and supporters, that is how you can measure your success and how you can get as many new people through the door and make them stick around because they love what you do and what value you are to them. We are going more in-depth in the other stages of this article about analytics and measurements.

![Understanding What 'Success' Means](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-02.jpg)

Understand What 'Success' Means

## 2\. Create Your Plan

When it comes to building a successful YouTube channel, consistency is super important. You are more likely to gain success if you have a well-thought-out plan and a strategy for uploading content. Instead of uploading once per month, try once per week if your time schedule allows it so your new viewers know when to expect a new video. Planning is super important because it will allow you to stick to a schedule. If you have a lot of time to create videos, people tend to get used to that schedule. Once you're planning becomes less structured because of lack of time, it can confuse viewers as consistency is important. People do not like change, or it will take time for them to get used to a new schedule, especially if it changes often.

![Creating Your Plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-03.jpg)

Create Your Plan

## 3\. Make Your YouTube Videos

After you created your plan, your strategy, and all the preparation, it is time to start filming! We highly recommend working with an upload schedule, so you know which videos to create and when they have to be finished. Try to have a good overall layout and theme for your videos from the start so people know who you are and what you do. Once you started filming you can continue the process and keep producing.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you have less time, you can create more videos in one filming session so you have a bulk library you can release over the period when you don't have time for creating content.

![Making Your YouTube Videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-04.jpg)

Make Your YouTube Videos

It's highly recommended to write down a list of topics for videos so you can have your same recording set ready to go for whenever you start shooting. If you are able to keep a dedicated space to keep your set, that's a huge plus instead of having to tear everything down and setting up again each time you film and it gives your viewers a consistent idea of what they can expect any time new video releases onto your YouTube channel.

## 4\. Use Analytics to Improve

Some marketers could have an unhealthy relationship with analytics. They track too many of the numbers. Maybe we think we can prove any marketing campaign is producing results if there's an eye-catching percentage. But we all know that some metrics are a lot more revealing than other types of statistics.

We have listed 3 important types of metrics you have to study to truly understand your audience.

### ❶ Watch Time

The Watch Time is the total amount of minutes viewers have spent watching your content. It's a key metric because YouTube pushes videos and channels with higher Watch Times in their search results and recommendations section. YouTube does this because the more Watch Time a video has, the more engaging their algorithm knows it is and YouTube like to recommend videos that keep viewers as long as possible on the platform.

![Watch Time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-05.jpg)

Watch Time

In the Watch Time section, you can see the amount of Watch Time your videos have generated. You can also rank each of your videos by Watch Time and group your videos by styles, lengths and themes to determine your most engaging videos.

### ❷ Average view duration

Your Average view duration is the total Watch Time of your video divided by the total number of video playbacks, also including replays. This metric measures your video's ability to engage people. If your video can't engage new visitors, they'll jump off from your video quite fast, leaving you with an unimpressive average view duration. If you create a high-performing video, your Average view duration and total Watch Time will increase over time and boost your search and recommendations rankings by a lot.

![Average view duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-06.jpg)

Average View Duration

### ❸ Audience Retention

Let's talk about Audience Retention. If your video is longer than five minutes, and Audience Retention is more than 50%, you are going in the right direction. A hook is something that grabs a viewer's attention and will result in them staying longer on your video or browsing your other content. We recommend regularly reviewing your videos to ensure you aren't attracting visitors to outdated content. Older videos can turn them away and they may view your YouTube channel as less trustworthy or valuable as a source for the information that they are looking for. Updated videos are high-quality videos.

![Audience Retention](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-07.jpg)

Audience Retention

## 5\. Promotion and Marketing

Now it is time to let all your hard work pay off! There is one last thing to focus on so your videos will generate your desired results. Promoting your video is important when it comes to letting it find the target audience. We have listed a few options for promoting and marketing your content.

![Promotion and marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-be-a-successful-youtuber-08.jpg)

### ❷ Social Media Advertisements

Let's talk about Audience Retention. If your video is longer than five minutes, and Audience Retention is more than 50%, you are going in the right direction. A hook is something that grabs a viewer's attention and will result in them staying longer on your video or browsing your other content. We recommend regularly reviewing your videos to ensure you aren't attracting visitors to outdated content. Older videos can turn them away and they may view your YouTube channel as less trustworthy or valuable as a source for the information that they are looking for. Updated videos are high-quality videos.

## Best Practical Tips to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun

Shooting outdoors is a challenge in most situations. We have to deal with the sun being overexposed or the background is too dark.

In this article, we'll show you how to light with the sun the easiest way. These simple and effective tips can help you block the harsh sun and make it to your advantage!

## 1) Preparation

You may need those things to film under the harsh sun:

1. An ND filter for your lens
2. A flag to block the sun. It can be anything like a black poster.
3. A white poster to bounce the sunlight.
4. Artificial light equipment.

Now let's see when and how to use them against the strong sunlight!

## 2) Direct to the Sun

If we want a specific background for our shot but our talent has to face the sun, here are some tips you can do to undermine the unflattering light or the blindness.

**1\. Pick up an ND filter on your lens**

![pick up an nd filter on lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/len.jpg)

We use it outside so we can open our aperture to get nice blurry backgrounds without overexposing our footage.

**2\. Use a "flag" to block or shape the sunlight**

![black flag](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/black-flag.jpg)

Using a black piece of poster board works perfectly fine, hold it up to the sun. Also, remember to angle your "flag" to create harsh lines or fully shade your talent.

**3\. Adjust your camera to fit the environment**

For example, you can change the exposure of your camera to match the talent's face giving a more silhouette look.

## 3) Back to the Sun

Have you ever been filming outside only to see your talent dark in the frame with the background blown out with light? To fix the problem, the simplest way is to use a "bounce".

By using a "bounce", we can reflect the light from the sun to our talent. Make sure to lift the bounce and move it around to get the right amount of light on your talent.

This should give us a nice look with the sun backlighting our subject and the bounce filling in the shadows and giving us soft light on our talent's face!

## 4) Artificial lighting

If we want to control our lighting better, we will want to use artificial lights in combination with the sun.

For example, weather changes. As you shot, the sun will move and make lighting challenging to keep consistent.

In that case, we can use the **flag technique** that we used before to block the harsh sunlight and then use our lights on our talent's face, this keeps our lighting more consistent than if we relied on just the natural light.

Now, take a look at the comparison with all the lighting conditions we create:

1. Flag VS Flag & Light

![flag vs flag light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/comparison-1.jpg)

1. Backlight VS Backlight & Bounce

![backlight vs backlight bounce](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/comparison-2.jpg)

## Summary

If you shoot or film outdoors, you must learn how to cope with the unsteady natural light. Hope this article helps you with that and kindly leave your thoughts below.

A keyframe, also spelled "key frame," defines any smooth transition's beginning and conclusion. In the case of animation or film, or video, that something may be a drawing or a specific frame of a shot.

The keyframe feature creates room for boundless creativity. The Keyframe feature could imitate any illusive or fascinating impact, from object enlargement to magical power effects. A key frame is a frame that serves as a marker for the start or stop of a parameter change.

You could use a keyframe to mark the spot where the audio will have faded up or down to a specific volume.

## Part 2\. Where to Use The Keyframe Feature?

Editors and creators use keyframing for all kinds of stuff. These uses include:

### Animated Logo Intros

![varying transparency clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-2.gif)

### Custom Picture-in-Picture Paths

We use the picture-in-picture effect in many editing formats, from tutorial videos to gaming streams and vlogs. Keyframing allows editors to execute the movement of the PIP as they wish. For instance, this video call was shot from a video.

## Leveraging the Vectorscope for Better Color Correction in Premiere Pro

Our eyes process colors differently. When two people look at the same picture, they may see different shades of colors. In post-production, Vectorscopes help to color grade and make sure you get your images exactly right. This means that you will process the exact color that you want across devices. **Premiere Vectorscope** is a great choice for anyone looking to correct and grade colors. Using Vectorscope Premiere allows you to get quantitative data about your image for a more accurate assessment of colors within the film. In this article, we explore what comprises Premiere Pro Vectorscope and how to use them in video editing.

## **Part 1\. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read**

Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.

The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-1.JPG)

Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.

### **How to Read a Vectorscope**

Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.

![reading vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-2.JPG)

The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.

Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.

Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.

## **Part 2\.** **[Vectorscope in Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html): A Brief Guide**

Just like many other video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro offers Vectorscope to help in post-production. The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.

The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:

### **1\. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro**

A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-3.JPG)

As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.

![drop-down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-4.JPG)

### **2\. Adjusting Skin Tones**

A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.

![skin tones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-5.JPG)

The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate

The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.

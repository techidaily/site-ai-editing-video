To complement your **Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate** presentation with a suitable background audio, visit the top toolbar and click on the ‘Add’ tab and select ‘Background Music’ from the list of options that appears next. A series of music titles will appear as you click on the ‘+’ icon in the ‘Background Music’ interface. You are allowed to reset the order of the listed music files through a mouse click.

If you want to remove the music titles, click on the ‘Trash Bin’ icon beside the ‘+’ button.

**Step 5: Let’s Play!**

You can choose to play your slideshow at this stage with simple elements of images and music. All you need to do is, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ below the top toolbar and click on Play’ button. You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow. The app works intelligently to supplement your presentation with random transition effects that play a new animation every time you run the slideshow.

If you are not satisfied with the default arrangements, you can also proceed to make adjustments in the transition play duration and even customize a transition style of your own with text and effects.

**Step 6: Adjust Your Image Properties**

To proceed with making adjustments to specific image characteristics, select the desired image and its properties will appear at the right side. You can now work with assigning a particular transition, comments and text to the image, while also making adjustments to the image screen time.

For adhering to the concern of adjusting the play durations of several images in a single instant, select them in the ‘Image List’ through the ‘Ctrl+ A’ command from your system’s keyboard and enter a specific play duration. Your entry will be applied to all the selected images.

You can however, escape the 2-way process by navigating to the ‘Program Settings’ tab and adjusting the pre-set image play duration. Your changes will be applicable to all the slideshow images that have their ‘Use Default Duration’ option enabled.

**Step 7: Add Suitable Transitions**

If the randomly included transitions of the slideshow program do not suit your presentation style, choose to add your preferred one from the software’s ‘Transition Library’ and tap the ‘Adjust’ button to customise the properties of your selection. You can also click on the ‘Play’ icon in the ‘Menu Bar’ and run the slideshow from the current image to see how the applied transition appears over the image.

**Step 8: Text Customizations**

You can further, add animations to the text and customize them to stay with or leave the text after the image play duration is over, by tapping the ‘Edit’ button. To present a combined play of text and image, while avoiding the separate text animation, click on the ‘Show Text with Image’ checkbox at the bottom right corner of the ‘Images’ menu.

**Step 9: Add Comments to the Images**

Navigate to the ‘Sound’ tab and enable your system’s microphone to add recorded comments to your slideshow. Start with clicking on the ‘Record’ button and narrate the comment. Don’t worry about the sync of image and comment play durations as the software program will automatically adjust both to be in line with each other.

If you are interested to add a particular sound file to a specific image, navigate to the ‘Yellow Folder’ at the top right corner to make your selection.

![Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Image Comments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/5-tips-for-aquasoft-slideshow-7.JPG)

**Step 10: Adding Effects to the Images**

To complement the images of your **Aquasoft Slideshow Ultimate 12** presentation with stunning images, navigate to the toolbar at the bottom of the editing workspace and click on the ‘Image Effects’ icon. To add the effect, drag it to a desired image in the project timeline. When you have reached the right place, drop the effect to apply it. To see the effect preview, navigate to the ‘Layout Designer Panel’ at the left, where you can find your image with the chosen effect.

![Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Adding Image Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/5-tips-for-aquasoft-slideshow-8.JPG)

**Step 11: Collage Creation**

Try hands at including a collage in your slideshow to play several numbers of images and texts within the same time frame. To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation. Once you are done with this, proceed to choose the desired images that you wish to add to the collage, succeeded by dragging the same to the ‘Collage’ object.

Move ahead with expanding the collage, to ensure a proper display of the images. You can further, apply selected transitions to the created collage under the latter’s ‘Object Settings’.

![Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Creating an Image Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/5-tips-for-aquasoft-slideshow-9.JPG)

**Step 12: Edit Your Collage**

Start with selecting the first image of your collage and adjusting its size in the ‘Layout Designer’ through the position frame at the edges of the photo. Next, you can proceed with positioning the image at the desired place within the collage. Repeat the process till all the images in your collage are at their respective places and within the respective size ratio.

Move ahead with including a relevant text at the end of your collage by selecting the ‘Text’ object in the bottom toolbar. Navigate to the last image of your collage and tap on ‘Text’ object to include it within the last image. You can make suitable formatting adjustments to the added text in the ‘Text’ tab of the ‘Object Settings’. Position your text at the appropriate place within the image and check a preview of the same by clicking on the ‘Play’ button in the ‘Menu Bar’ above the project timeline.

![Creating an Aquasoft Slideshow- Editing the Collage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/5-tips-for-aquasoft-slideshow-10.JPG)

**Step 13: Including a Chapter**

If you are not satisfied with a single image track, proceed to add chapters to your presentation. Start with selecting the ‘Chapter’ object from the ‘Object Toolbar’ to insert the former in the timeline, followed by dragging 2 images into the same. Tap the ‘Play’ button to open the chapter and add suitable text and animation to it in similar way as you would do for a collage. Position the images at the desired place using the red ‘Position Bar’.

## Part 3 **What Makes People to Uninstall Aquasoft Slideshow Premium?**

Although a very reliable slideshow software program, the Aquasoft Slideshow Premium application suffers from viewer disruption and uninstallation. While there are a number of underlying reasons to the user disloyalty, it is often observed that a variety of issues are put forward post the uninstallation process. Entering into the domain, let us talk about some of the potential causes and after effects of the Aquasoft Slideshow Premium software uninstallation in the following section:

### 01Reasons Behind the Uninstallation of Aquasoft Slideshow Premium Software

**●** **Compatibility Issues**

Working with the aforesaid slideshow creator program tends to cause a distortion in the normalized running of the other already existing applications within your device. While some of them may encounter a temporary shutdown, others may permanently cease to operate, causing a great deal of inconvenience.

**●** **Flawless Running Issues**

When using the tool on a regular basis, you may encounter frequent and periodic software crashes, along with a complete standby of the program, prohibiting you from moving ahead with the slideshow creation process, or a flawless execution of the created slideshow presentation.

**●** **Re-installation Cringes**

The software enters into repeated installation and uninstallation cycles out of the blue, causing much inconvenience at the user’s disposal, making it a necessity to permanently get rid of the program.

**●** **Reduced User Credibility**

The software reviews often report of unsatisfied users with an unreliable working experience. If that was not enough, some of the most trusted product review websites and long term users of the program have rendered the utility to be malicious.

**●** **Absence in Control Panel**

While all your system and application software can be found on the Control Panel and Windows listings, the aforesaid slideshow creator program is an exception. This leads to the unavailability of troubleshooting methods and settings adjustments, in case the program encounters a problem while running.

**●** **Incomplete Removal**

One of the biggest glitches with the software is that you possibly can never uninstall it completely, because some of the latter’s associated processes and software file traces tend to remain forever on your system, causing interference with the working of other programs.

**●** **Never-ending Uninstallation Process**

While you may opt to take the program out of your system to get rid of the inconvenience, that too is not an easy process to say the least. The uninstallation process once initiated does not seem to reach its end to what you can call ages!

### 02Uninstallation Inconsistencies of Aquasoft Slideshow Premium Software

**●** **Uninstaller Issues**

Inconsistencies lie within the software itself, with its inbuilt uninstaller program refusing to work in cohesion with the assigned task. Sometimes it may refrain from opening up, while in other cases, the program comes to an unannounced run halt amid the uninstallation process.

**●** **Issues of File Processing**

The preset uninstallation package often fails to run or process a particular file which is necessary for uninstalling the program. The running process may often not initiate or stop midway, hence causing users enough discomfort to move towards getting rid of the program.

**●** **Processing Errors**

Often during the uninstallation process, you may encounter a series of processing errors leading to unsuccessful installation of most of the important files, which causes the leash over of partially deleted program files, barging your system’s memory with unusable data and irrelevant information.

**●** **Startup Prevention**

It may be a common instance to notice that the program refrains from being completely uninstalled due to some different program installed in your device. The allied program may interfere with the uninterrupted running of the Aquasoft uninstallation program.

## Part 4   **Tips for Aquasoft Slideshow**

Aquasoft slideshows are exemplary elements in the domain of content presentation that give you the liberty to explore your editing creativity and design stunning graphic masterpieces within the quickest time span. While there are thousands of ways that you can use uplift your Aquasoft slideshows in your own unique styles, going through the following tips can be handy in adding life to your presentations:

### 01Use Keyframes

Take a complete control of the styles and appearance of the slideshow elements, playing to your heart’s content with effects, filters, sound, video and photographic animations to give the perfect look, sound and movements of your presentation pieces to develop a graphic work of art. The Aquasoft slideshow creator program offers a range of keyframe elements to compliment your slideshow presentations.

### 02Prefer Live Presentations

After you are done with creating your presentation, do take the liberty to use the ‘Live Preview’ feature of the tool to examine the exact appearance of the applied effects, transitions and filters, music and themes, color and title overlays and other elements, to ensure a precise placement of the included components.

### 03360 Effect Rotations

If you have worked with animated and moving elements, videos, etc., in your presentation, use the 360 rotation effect for a complete visualization of the applied effects. You can also play with the effect to present titles, images and videos in 3-dimensional space to make your slideshows stand ahead in the line of customary graphic presentations.

### 04Synchronize Your Audio

When adding background music to your presentations, take care to synchronize the same with the slide contents and elements. Adjust the audio settings and parameters to match the screen time and run frequencies of elements appearing in parallel. Unmatched audio is a barrier to flawless presentation, and proves to be a pivotal distraction of your audience.

### 05Avoid Overcrowding

When creating your slideshows, it may be a common confusion to select the perfect customization element, where most of us end up crowding the slides with a heap of components, making the presentation a messy bank of elements that often shadows the actual contents.

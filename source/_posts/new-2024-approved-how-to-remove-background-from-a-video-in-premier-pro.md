## A Detailed Guid to Remove Background From a Video in Premier Pro

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the leading video editing software. You can use to create or remove a video's background. Advanced Chroma Key features such as Color Key and Ultra Key make it possible to produce background-free content quickly.

Although both Keys work similarly, many users prefer to use the Ultra key for a better result in the video. This article will explain how to remove video background in Premiere Pro if you are a newbie.

Let's get right to it and start the tutorial!

## How to Use Premiere Pro to Remove Video Background?

Adobe Premiere Pro can remove video backgrounds quickly using the **Ultra Key** feature with the following steps:

Step1 In the first step, launch a browser, and download the appropriate Adobe Premiere Pro version for your [Windows PC](https://adobe-premiere.en.softonic.com/) or [Mac](https://filehippo.com/mac/download%5Fadobe-premiere-pro-cc-for-mac/). Next, install the software on your system and launch it from your Desktop or Dock.

Step2 Now, use the **Media Browser panel** in the software to browse the video clips you want to import into the software. Next, right-click on your selected video file in which you want to remove the background and choose the **"Import"** option.

You can always use or share experiences to be your topic content whether it is beauty, make-up tutorial, DIY’s, Skin care ideas, etc. As long as you can share honestly and correctly.

Do whatever you love, do something that you like, expertise, make a relatable videos or timely videos and searchable videos. Create a content that people need or are often searched for online, content that can provide information to people. I suggest you go with "how to" videos, because people always searched for this kind of content.

## 3\. Create a YouTube Channel

Your channel name is the official name for your channel on YouTube. Your channel name is a big part of how people will define and understand what your channel is about. So, it’s important that your name accurately represents your brand. It's important that your name stands out from another channel on YouTube or should be unique.

![Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** So before deciding on a name, pop your potential name into YouTube and see what comes up, if you can’t find any similar sounding channels, you’re good to go.

For example, my channel name is Mayang Dyosa, Mayang is what my family and friend called me and Dyosa means Goddess. I find it unique and cute because that’s my dream to be a Goddess.

### ❶ Content

One of the challenging parts being a YouTuber is finding a right content for your channel.

You can use YouTube’s trending page this is the easiest way to find trending topic for you to have an idea of what topic or content you like. You can always use or share experiences to be your topic content whether it is beauty, make-up tutorial, DIY’s, Skin care ideas, etc. As long as you can share honestly and correctly.

Do whatever you love, do something that you like, expertise, make a relatable videos or timely videos and searchable videos. Create a content that people need or are often searched for online, content that can provide information to people. I suggest you go with "how to" videos, because people always searched for this kind of content.

### 1\. The Razor tool

The Razor tool in Premiere is the simplest way to split or cut clips. This enables you to separate clips from the project timeline during your chosen clip. This technique is useful for making the first rough cut of your clips, with the sole drawback being that it can be less exact.

**You can use the following steps to split a clip using the Razor tool:**

Step1By pressing **Cmd+I or Ctrl+I** or by choosing File > Import, you can import it into Premiere Pro.

Step2Drag the clip onto the timeline if there is an existing sequence. If not, use the right-click menu to choose **New Sequence From Clip**. The video will now appear as a single block.

Step3Choose the Razor tool from the panel next to the timeline to split the clip.

Step4To split a video clip, click on the section you want to split.

Step5Now that you have two segments from the same video file, you can edit them separately.

### 2\. Current-Time Indicator

A blue triangular indication called the **Current Time Indicator (CTI)** lets you know where you are in the timeline. CTIs are employed in a variety of panels.

**You can follow these steps to split the clip using Current-Time Indicator:**

Step1Select the section of the clip you want to split by moving the Current-Time Indicator there.

Step2Ensure that the video layer you want to split is highlighted on the timeline's left side.

Step3Use the keyboard shortcuts Cmd+K or Ctrl+K to split the clip.

### 3\. Source Panel

Individual clips are played back on the Source Monitor. You prepare clips for a sequence in the Source Monitor. You designate the clip's source tracks, In points, and Out points. In a Timeline panel, you may add clips to a sequence and place clip markers.

**How to split video clips with source panel in premiere pro** **:**

For the clip, you want to split to appear in the Source panel, choose it from the Project panel. Then take these actions.

Step1First, locate the arrow-shaped marker at the start of the clip's time bar in the **Source Panel** to navigate and indicate the In and Out points.

Step2Wherever you want the In and Out indicators to appear, press the **I** or **O** key. I stand for inside, and **O** for outside.

Step3Select Insert from the Source panel's tools once your marks are in place.

## Part 3\. How to split video and audio in alternative to premiere pro?

As a professional video editing software, Premiere Pro offers a wide range of professional editing features. But, for a beginner, it might seem time-consuming to master the software. Because it requires a high-speed PC due to the video resolution and requirements. So, we suggest [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) because it is considerably easier to use. Products on Filmora are available for various users, from novice to expert. A timeline, preview window, and effects library are common features. These may be accessed and managed using a drag-and-drop interface.

**You can follow these steps to split audio and video without any hassle:**

Step1To add video files to the Timeline for trimming, first click "**Import**" on the main windows and choose the video files you want from your computer. You can also just drag and drop movies into the Media Library.

What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:

### TS

TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.

### MP4

MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the '.ts' extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.

### Bottom Line

## Part 1\. What Is TS Video Format?

A TS format file is a Video Transport Stream file. The TS file extension is used to store video data, mostly on DVDs. The video files are standardly compressed with .MPEG video compression. If you are looking for a file extension to save streamed or broadcast videos, TS video format is ideal for this. Are you worried about how to play a TS file?

![what is ts format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/ts-file-format-1.jpg)

Well, a video file with this format can easily be played on a certain media player or [video editing program](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Various video playback apps, video development tools, and also DVD creation programs support the TS format. The .ts file extension can also contain any data, and TS files don't always need to store media or documents.

## Part 2\. Pros and Coins about TS Video Format

Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!

### Advantages of TS File Format

A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.

Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.

### Drawbacks of TS File Format

Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.

Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.

## Part 3\. How to Play TS Video Files with VLC Media Player?

## 4 Solutions to Crop a Video on Android Easily

Nowadays, we can use our mobile phones to create almost anything – they have become an indivisible part of our lives. Most of the people check their mobile phones every 2 minutes – did they receive a new message?

What about different kinds of notifications – reactions on social network, or the ones which inform us about breaking news, or, to-do lists? People are well-connected to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and sometimes, we just want to update our accounts with just photos or new videos we took on the go. Sometimes, we have a perfect footage we took with our Android, but we have no idea, or just no time to edit our stunning video clips on the computer.

Yes, changing or adjusting a video shouldn’t be that hard – you shouldn’t be obligated to turn to Adobe Premiere Pro or other “heavy” software in order to have a video to your whole liking. Therefore, we have mobile applications just for editing our videos, in a simple, and fast way (thank you, mobile developers!).

In this article, we will be discussing how to crop a video on Android, but since most android devices don’t have this option, you will need to do it externally, by downloading and using different apps. So, more concretely, we will touch upon how to crop our video clips using following apps: Google Photos, Clideo, and Filmora.

## Using Google Photos

In case you have Android, the Google Photos app will be there – it’s free and in most cases, already installed and ready to serve you. If you can’t find Google Photos, just find it and download it from the Google Play Store.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-1.jpeg)

First off, you just open the application and allow it to access photos and media on your device. Tap the video you would like to crop. Then, click on Edit: it will launch the in-app video editor.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-2.jpeg)

At the bottom, you will see the Crop option and hit on it, which will result in appearing a cropping box around your video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-3.jpeg)

Once you see little icons at the bottom, you need to choose the first one – it’s the Ratio button, through which you can choose the aspect you would like to apply. Your choice is between these several aspect ratios: Free, Original, Square, 5:4, 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-4.jpeg)

Choosing Free ratio option gives you the freedom to adjust the cropping sliders manually, in order to resize the video to any aspect ratio; it is even possible to rotate the clip, pinch, and zoom in/out.

After you are done with adjusting your video, you need to click on the Save Copy button, which will save a new edited version of your footage. And, meanwhile, don’t worry! – this will not be overwritten on the original one, which will still stand intact.

## Using Clideo

Clideo is an interesting one… it doesn’t require you to download anything, because there is a way to crop your video online, through the web browser on Android.

First off, you need to click on [Clideo’s Android crop video tool](https://clideo.com/crop-video) from the browser on the smartphone. You will see a Choose File button and hit on it – this will take you to your gallery and let you find the clip you are about to crop.

You can also upload your file from Cloud Storage. You need to click on the down-arrow on the right-hand side of the button and you’ll find the option to add a clip from your Dropbox or Google Drive account.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-6.jpeg)

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-7.jpeg)

After your file is uploaded, Clideo will take you to the editing page, where you can select the area you would like to be in the edited version, and crop the video. Here, you will be able to choose the aspect ratio, exact size of the video and the format.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-8.jpeg)

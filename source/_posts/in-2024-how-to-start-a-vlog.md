## How to Start a Vlog

I’m Maya of Mayang Dyosa on YouTube channel, vlogger since 2017 and I started my vlogging career out of boredom. I give up my managerial career so that I can watch over my child. That’s the time I thought of videoing what I’m doing at home and uploading it to YouTube for me to watch all over again, I accidentally made the videos public and I was surprised that there were viewers. Until I continued to upload and others requested the video what they want to see on my channel.

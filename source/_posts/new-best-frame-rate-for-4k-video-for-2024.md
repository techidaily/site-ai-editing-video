## Best Frame Rate for 4K Video

People in the videography ad filmmaking world use complicated terminology like Ultra High Def to describe 4K videos. Even though you are not a complete stranger to the term 4K, you might still be unaware of what it means.

In a nutshell, 4K is the highest resolution you can watch your movies and videos. The details are incredibly crisp, meaning you can see pimples or the pores on an actor's face through the screen. However, the frame rate will significantly affect how you enjoy a 4K video. Therefore, it would be wise to learn how to choose the ideal frame rate to suit your needs.

Keep reading this article to learn more about frame rates and which is suitable for a 4K video.

## How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?

The motion will appear smoother if your video contains more frames per second. Even though your viewers are not tech-savvy, they will definitely notice the difference.

Consider a video of a duck drinking water from a pond. If you film and playback the same video in 24, 30, and 60fps, you will see a noticeable difference, assuming your shutter speed is set according to the 180-degree shutter rule.

If you are filming quicker motions of wildlife and birds, you are better off sticking to higher resolutions to give the viewer a pleasant experience and ensure the motion is fluid.

On the other hand, lower frame rates like 24fps are ideal for human movements, which are not as smooth as wildlife. Suppose you used 60fps for a cinematic film or a TV show. The video would look a bit odd because that is not how we see things in the natural world. In addition, your viewers aren't used to such smoothness.

## Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos

You may have heard about 4K videos and wondered what people mean by that term. In simple terms, a 4K video is a high-resolution video that is four times the usual 1080p HD video. When it comes to 4K videos, there are two standard resolutions. One of them is the standard for Digital Cinema which is 4096\*2160 pixels. The other is for television and is 3840\*2160 pixels.

To stream 4K content, you need a bandwidth between 10 and 20 Mbps. On the other hand, streaming platforms like Netflix require higher bandwidths of not less than 15 Mbps. In addition to the bandwidth we mentioned earlier, you need a 4KTV or 4K monitor.

This specification was brought up at the UHD Alliance, a union of more than 50 tech companies working together to support 4K content. Tech companies ought to ensure the devices they produce are compatible with 4K videos, which are becoming increasingly popular.

Below is a list of requirements any electronic device should fulfill before being termed a 4KTV or 4K monitor.

![requirements of 4k videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-requirements.jpg)

* A resolution of not less than 3840\*2160.
* A 10-bit color depth that allows for 1,024 shades of red, yellow, and blue.
* A high dynamic range for color accuracy.
* An excellent combination of black level and peak brightness. The peak brightness should not exceed 1,000 nits, and the black level shouldn't go below 0.5 nits. Alternatively, the peak brightness shouldn't exceed 540 nits; neither should the black level plummet below 0.0005 nits.

## Best Frame Rate for 4K Video

We all know that the frame rate you choose for your video will significantly impact the viewer's experience and the overall style of your video. The frame rate will also affect how the video looks. For instance, a frame rate lower than 24fps will make your video look unprofessional and of poor quality. The content will also flicker because there aren't many still images per second.

On the other hand, a lower FPS causes the file size to be smaller, causing it to consume a lower bandwidth. The vice versa is also true. Now that you understand these facts, you might wonder which frame rate would be best for your 4K videos.

Research reveals that the most acceptable frame rate is 30fps and 60fps. This is because the motion will appear natural to the human eye without being too fast or unrealistic.

If you are wondering what is the best frame rate for 4k videos, we urge you to select 60fps because it contains more detail. The higher frame rate also makes the motion look very smooth and crisp. Perhaps you want to shoot a slow-motion video. In that case, an even higher frame rate of 120fps would be ideal.

## How To Choose The Base Frame Rates for Your Next Video

Choosing a frame rate for your videos is not complicated. However, it is not a straightforward process either. There are numerous moving parts that ought to work harmoniously for your video to turn out perfect and guarantee your audience will have a pleasant viewing experience. Before we dive into choosing the best frame rate for your 4K videos, let's help you understand the filmmaking process.

Most filmmakers and videographers see it fit to shoot videos in 120p or 4K. This step makes their work easier during the editing process. If the raw footage is in 4K, they can de-emphasize or retain specific plot points that would look great in the final video. However, not everyone is shooting a video for Hollywood. Therefore, shooting in 4K on your laptop for your YouTube channel might be difficult.

Below are some factors you should consider when choosing the best frame rate for a 4k video.

![factors for choosing frame rate for videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-frame-rate.jpg)

#### File size

Shooting your video at a higher frame rate means more still images are packed into a single second of the video. Therefore, you will end up with a larger file size. If you want to shoot a video for your YouTube channel, it would be wise to stick to a smaller frame rate.

#### Purpose

It wouldn't make sense to shoot a talking head video at more than 24fps. However, a higher frame rate would be ideal for a travel vlog, where the details need to be crisp.

#### Medium of delivery

The standard frame rate for television is 24fps. On the other hand, it would be best to stick to a higher frame rate of 60fps if you intend to shoot content for the silver screen.

#### Motion in the video

Lastly, the movement within the video will play a massive role in the frame rate you choose. The faster the motion, the higher the frame rate needs to be. For instance, action movies don't do well in frame rates of less than 60 fps.

## Part 1: Zoom In On TikTok After Recording

The Zoom In feature across any mobile platform has some specific uses and highlights a particular set of characteristics for its users. While using TikTok, you may find the need to highlight a certain section of the video that you've recorded to make it visible to users. It may be something that needs to be shown out of curiosity. To understand **how to zoom in on TikTok after recording,** go through the detailed steps presented as follows:

**Step 1:** You need to start the process of downloading and installing TikTok on your device. Launch it on your phone and proceed by clicking the "+" icon on the bottom of the screen to record or create a new video across TikTok.

![tap on plus icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-on-tiktok-videos-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Hold the red button of the recording and effectively create a video of your liking. Leave the button once you are done recording the video. As you've recorded the video, click on the "Tick" icon to proceed to the edit page of TikTok.

![record the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-on-tiktok-videos-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Find yourselves on the editing page of TikTok with a list of multiple editing options across the screen. Click on the "Effects" button and find the "Zoom" effect across the available list. To find the effect, let the editor cursor of the video reach the point where you want to add the Zoom in effect. Once it reaches the point of the video, hold the "Zoom" effect button for the specific time that you want to add the effect to your video. You can then conclude editing your video on TikTok and proceed to save it.

### Advantages of Zooming Videos After Recording

* This puts you in more control of the video rather than improvising the need to zoom in on a video during recording.
* Zoom into the specific part or portion of the video that you find necessary for covering the purpose. You cannot perform such actions while recording a video since the recording is quite restricted across a device.
* Adding zoom in effect across the video gives it a proper effect that enhances the quality rather than depreciating it.

### Disadvantages of Zooming Videos After Recording

* If you put in a zoom in effect on your video, this cannot be reverted back or zoomed out.
* The frame rate of the video is heavily damaged by using such effects across your recorded video. As this is done through the software, there is a guaranteed decrease in the quality output of the video.

To help you better grasp motion blur and how to add motion blur to flawlessly merge objects in your video projects or even create styled effects, we've put up a detailed guide here.

4. [Apply filters](#part3-4)
5. [Export](#part3-5)

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 2\. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects

In videos, slow-motion may be used in a variety of ways, such as to convey the emotional context of a story or make beautiful slideshow backdrops. It doesn't matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects' slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.

Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You'll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:

**Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:**

So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur's magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.

Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn't already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose "New Project" to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.

![install adobe after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-adobe-after-effects.jpg)

Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose "Effects & Presets." A search bar will appear as a result. Enter "CC Force Motion Blur" in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.

![preview effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

Step3 Next, drag the "CC Force Motion Blur" to the layers that represent your imported video at the bottom left of the screen.

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 2\. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects

In videos, slow-motion may be used in a variety of ways, such as to convey the emotional context of a story or make beautiful slideshow backdrops. It doesn't matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects' slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.

Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You'll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:

**Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:**

So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur's magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.

Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn't already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose "New Project" to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.

![install adobe after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-adobe-after-effects.jpg)

Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose "Effects & Presets." A search bar will appear as a result. Enter "CC Force Motion Blur" in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.

![preview effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

Step3 Next, drag the "CC Force Motion Blur" to the layers that represent your imported video at the bottom left of the screen. On the left side of the screen, under "CC Force Motion Blur," you will find settings for motion blur. Here, you may change the motion blur to suit your needs. You may type in the values and watch the video as appropriate. There are several choices available for you to modify.

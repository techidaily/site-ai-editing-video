## Green Screen Is a Widely Used Effect in After Effects. Many Professional Photographers Use It to Make Creative Video Effects. This Guide Will Show You How to Use Green Screen to Videos in After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

## Step by Step to Rotate Video in Google Photos

Google photos let you store, view, edit and share your videos and photos and are automatically organized. It is a very great cloud storage service and most people use it. Google Photos has introduced an artificial intelligence technology into the app. That’s why it can automatically organize and rotate.

You have videos on google photos that are automatically rotated, others are not.

How do you rotate them manually?

It’s is so simple and will not take much of your time.

Let’s dive in…

## **Rotating videos in google photos**

Rotating a video in google photos is pretty simple and will not take much of your time. You can easily fix the rotation and aspect ratio of your videos. But it’s a little tricky.

I'm going to show you how to flip your videos from portrait mode to landscape mode or from landscape mode to portrait mode.

You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you're going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-1.png)

You will see a diamond with a circular arrow on it. You're going to hit that until you find the way you want it to be.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-2.png)

Once you're happy, in the top right hand corner, hit Save Copy and that's it, the size of the file determines how long it takes to finish this process later.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-3.png)

## **An easier way to rotate videos in Google Photos**

If you just need to rotate a video in portrait mode to the landscape mode or 180 degrees, Google photos will be the best choice to do that. However, what if rotate a video 32 degrees or 157 degrees, or maybe you need to do more editing operations, you can’t rely on Google Photos anymore.

But stop worrying, you can set your video at any angle with [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) .

## Practical Way to Resize Video in Handbrake

Videos are a great medium to share thoughts, concepts, guides, and memories, but regardless of how far technology has come getting them online can pose an issue sometimes. These obstacles often tend to be because either a video clip is too long or the amount of data in it is so high that the service just cannot upload the file to its servers and make it available for the intended receiver.

To solve this issue, users often need to resize a video so that the data cap, which behaved as a restriction, is no longer applicable. Now, there exist multiple software that can do this, and most video editor programs include the ability to export videos in less data-hungry sizes or formats.

So, if you ever face a similar issue, here is a guide on how you can resize videos via Handbrake and Wondershare Filmora. The former is a lightweight tool perfect for batch resizing videos, while the latter is a powerful free video editing software.

## How to resize video with Handbrake

Open Handbrake and follow the steps listed below.

Once open, the software will present you with options to either import a single video file for resize or a whole batch via folder selection.

**_Note:_** _If you do not have Handbrake, you can_ [_download it by visiting the official website_](https://handbrake.fr/)_. Also, you will need_ [_Windows .NET Framework 6.0_](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime?utm%5Fsource=getdotnetcore&utm%5Fmedium=referral) _to use Handbrake._ _If your system does not have the correct config Handbrake will let you know and fail to launch._

Once you have imported the video file, the software will present you with two choices.

* **Option 1:** Use a preset available in the application — the best choice for beginners to choose for beginners.
* **Option 2:** Set a custom resolution via the Dimensions Tab.

**_Note:_** _To ensure the resize is perfect, find out which file format plays best with the end location of your video and convert the video clip to that version._

### **How to Resize Video via Option 2**

**Step 1:** Import Video File by choosing

* Single Import, or
* Batch Import

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-8.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Click on the Dimensions Tab to open up a dialog box that will let you edit video resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-10.jpeg)

The Dimensions Dialog Box

**Step 3:** Modify resolution to ensure the clip you get is in the right setup.

**_Note:_** _If you see 1920 x 1080 on your screen, the first number (1920) stands for the width of the video file, while the second number (1080) stands for the height._

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-11.jpeg)

**Tip**

The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide

_Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution._

## An easier way to resize video with Wondershare Filmora

While the resize feature in Handbrake is capable of working on multiple video files at once, the user interface of the application may seem daunting to some. Hence, if you’re just starting to learn, we recommend accessing more user-friendly software, say Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . You can resize videos in the video editor by following the steps we have detailed below.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.

**Step 1:** Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-12.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.

**Author’s Notes:** Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg)

Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision

**Step 4:** Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg)

With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.

**Note:** You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the **Project Settings** option, found under the **File Tab**.

## The Bottom Line

Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.

## Create the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect Video

With stranger things season 4 ending, it seems like great timing to make a stranger things style transition to the Upside Down. In the Netflix series Stranger Things, there is an opposite version of our world called the Upside Down. The Upside Down is dark, creepy, and possibly filled with aliens, monsters, creatures, and other things.

Now, you can also apply the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect to your video! This effect combines camera tricks and video editing within [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to transition from the normal world into the Upside Down.

## How-to Guide

_**1) Preparation**_

To make this effect, you will need two footage shots: one with the camera moving down and one with the camera coming back up.

When shooting for the footage, follow the steps below:

**First shot**

1. Find any item close enough to the ground that we can block our frame with.

![block our frame with item](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-1.jpg)

1. Once you have your talent lined up, rotate your camera while lowering it below the foreground item at a constant speed and leaving the camera there. The key is making sure when you go behind the object, the frame is nothing but black.

![rotate your camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-2.gif)

For the next scene, have your actor change positions, or you can change the set around to look like the Upside Down. For instance, adding fake plants and flickering lights.

**Second shot**

Start bringing your camera back up at the same speed and rotate it again in the direction it was moving.

![start bringing your camera back up](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-3.gif)

_**2) Steps**_

After you have all the footage, you can start editing it on Filmora. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download Filmora at their official website at <https://filmora.wondershare.com>.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Now, launch Filmora on your PC and follow the steps below:

Step1 Take your first clip in the “normal” world and drag it down to a video track on the timeline. Trim the edge of the clip, so it ends on pure black and in a downward motion.

![trim the edge of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-4.jpg)

Step2 Drag the second clip (in the Upside Down) onto the video track on the timeline after the first clip. Trim this video, so it begins in pure black and an upward motion.

![trim video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-5.jpg)

Cut the clips to get the timing right since it should be a very fast transition. You can cut in the black frames so they won't be too apparent.

If you don't have a perfectly smooth transition, you can add a dissolve by going to **Transitions > Basic > Dissolve**.

![cut the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-6.jpg)

**Color Grading and Effects**

After the transition, you can make the clip look a lot more like the Upside Down from the show with a color grade and Filmora effects. Follow the steps below:

Step1 Double-click on your second clip, then go to **Color > Advanced**. For a quick edit, you can try one of the presets available, such as “cool film.” It will give you the colder blue tones that Stranger Things used for the Upside Down.

![go to color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-7.jpg)

Step2 You can further edit the color grading in the white balance menu. Drag the slider to the left to get a blue, cold vibe for the Upside Down.

The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.

![further edit the color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-8.gif)

Step3 Next, move down to the color, lower the brightness and increase contrast. It makes the scene darker and more sinister than the normal world.

![move down to the color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-9.jpg)

Step4 Finally, go down to the vignette and drag the amount slider a tiny bit to give a Vinnette around your clip.

![go down to the vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-10.jpg)

_**3) Pro Tips**_

You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.

Go to **Elements > Smoke > Smokescreen 2**. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.

![drag this element on top of your upside down clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-11.jpg)

You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.

Finally, go to the **Transition > Basic > Dissolve** to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.

![open the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-12.jpg)

## Resources from Filmostock

You can also use filmstock effects to bring our video to the next level. Go to **Elements > Fire > Large Scale 12** and drag it down on top of your clip and the smoke.

![go to elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-13.jpg)

Double-click the clip and change the scale of the effect to your needs. Then, go to compositing to change the blending mode to the screen to help the effect blend in more.

![change the scale of the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-14.jpg)

Now, go to color and open the white balance menu. Drag the two sliders to change the color of the particles to match your clip.

## OpenCV Object Tracking: The Complete Guide

**OpenCV Tracking** is a popular method used for tracking objects in a video in real-time. OpenCV is a powerful library used for image processing and computer vision applications.

From real-time video analysis to Augmented Reality, OpenCV Tracking has a wide range of uses and can help both private and public sectors to detect and track the desired object in an image or video.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore **OpenCV Tracking** and its pre-built trackers**.** We will use the OpenCV library and Python to implement this Object Tracking application.

2. [The Pre-Built Algorithms OpenCV Offers For Object Tracking](#part5-2)  
3. [Implementation In Python And OpenCV](#part5-3)

## Part 1\. What Is Object Tracking?

Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.

Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.

Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it's a challenge, it's not impossible to accomplish.

And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:

### 1\. SOT & MOT

1. **Single Object Tracking (SOT):** SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and/or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.
2. **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):** MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.

### 2\. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection

After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.

The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.

## Part 2\. Types Of Object Tracking

### Image Tracking

Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.

Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.

### Video Tracking

Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.

## Part 3\. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?

As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:

**Background Clutter:** The background can impact extracting an object's features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.

**Occlusion:** This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.

**Varying spatial scales:** Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.

**Training and Tracking Speed:** If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.

## Part 4\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.

### 1\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:

**Target Initialization**

Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.

**Appearance Modeling**

Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.

**Motion Estimation**

Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object's future position with precision.

**Target Positioning**

Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object's location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target's location more accurately.

### 2\. Methods Of Object Tracking

Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:

**OpenCV-Based Object Tracking**

**OpenCV Object Tracking** method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.

**MDNet**

Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.

The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.

**DeepSort**

DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.

DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.

**ROLO**

ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.

## Part 5\. The powerful backup: OpenCV

We have demonstrated how powerful OpenCV Tracking is and how it works. However, do you wonder what OpenCV is? How it supports the tracking goals being achieved? In this part, we will focus on OpenCV and help you better understand the the underlying mechanisms.

### 1\. What Is OpenCV?

OpenCV is a powerful library that allows you to perform image processing, deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision tasks on live video feeds. Moreover, it can be used to detect objects, track their movements, and recognize faces.

## Part 1\. What Is Object Tracking?

Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.

Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.

Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it's a challenge, it's not impossible to accomplish.

And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:

### 1\. SOT & MOT

1. **Single Object Tracking (SOT):** SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and/or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.
2. **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):** MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.

### 2\. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection

After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.

The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.

## Part 2\. Types Of Object Tracking

### Image Tracking

Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.

Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.

### Video Tracking

Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.

## Part 3\. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?

As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:

**Background Clutter:** The background can impact extracting an object's features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.

**Occlusion:** This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.

**Varying spatial scales:** Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.

**Training and Tracking Speed:** If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.

## Part 4\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.

### 1\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:

**Target Initialization**

Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.

**Appearance Modeling**

If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

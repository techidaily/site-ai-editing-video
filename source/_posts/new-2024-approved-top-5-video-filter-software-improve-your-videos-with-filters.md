Step 6

Split the footage and delete the part on the right side of the Playhead.

Step 7

Without moving the Playhead, simply drag the snapshot you took earlier. Right-click on the snapshot in the timeline and click on “**Duration”.** Then, set the duration to **1 second**. Finally, click “**OK**”.

Step 8

Open your browser and go to the [Picsart photo effects editor](https://picsart.com/photo-effects/photo-to-cartoon). Upload the same snapshot we made in Filmora and apply the “Comic” preset on it. Then, download the photo and import it back into Filmora.

Step 9

Drag the snapshot with the Comic preset to the Timeline and set its duration to 1 second as well.

Step 10

Repeat the same process with the second clip. Take a snapshot, add the Comic effect, and import it back into Filmora. But this time, align the clips as follows: Add the snapshot with the comic preset first, then the snapshot without any effects, and then the video. It should look like this.

Step 11

Go to the Transitions tab and drag the “Color Distance” transition between the first and second snapshot on your Timeline. Then, right-click on the transition box in the timeline and select “**Edit Properties**”. From there, change the duration of the transition to 1 second and click “**OK**”.

Step 13

Place the last transition between the last two snapshots in your timeline. This time, we’re going to use the “**Evaporate**” transition. Set its duration to 1 second as well.

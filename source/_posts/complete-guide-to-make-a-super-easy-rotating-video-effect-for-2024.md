It helps to indulge the audience with your content and show the after and before transitions. You can try this with any object or any character. But first, let's figure out the requirements for rotating effects.

## Part 2\. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect

You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.

### The Subject Matters

To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it's you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:

* The person should get two different costumes.
* All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting
* Show affinity and control of the camera.

![character of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-2.png)

### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

**Note:** Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.

![smartphone for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png)

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

##### Step 1

Set the resolution to 2.7k for a slow-motion video and a frame rate of 240fps. Afterward, keep the “Color” natural if you don’t want to color grade it. Moreover, adjust the “Sharping” low by using its respective options.

![set resolution and frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/gopro-slow-motion-with-quality-1.jpg)

##### Step 2

![set bit rate to high](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/gopro-slow-motion-with-quality-3.jpg)

## Part 2: Slow Down Videos on GoPro Quik After Recording

After recording the required clip, post-editing is important to polish the digital content. GoPro also offers [GoPro Quik](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor) to edit slow-motion videos to your desired extent. Unfortunately, not everyone can quickly discover **Go Pro slow motion** in their first use. That’s why it’s necessary to follow the given steps so you can easily discover and edit slow motion.

##### Step 1

Access the GoPro Quick on your device and launch it. Choose the "Media" icon in the bottom bar and select the video you want to edit. After importing the required media files, start working on a project.

![select media to import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/gopro-slow-motion-with-quality-4.jpg)

## Part 3: Make Better Slow-Motion Videos with Wondershare Filmora

Making a slow motion means spending cognitive effort and time on a project. Thus, video editors seek a reliable platform like **GoPro Hero 11,** [**which is slow motion**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Unfortunately, this editing app is outdated, and other better platforms are being developed. In search of the latest and easy-to-use video editor, use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

It is a video editing software with various powerful editing features compared with GoPro Quik. This platform can perform more tasks than trimming, merging, and splitting clips. Filmora is equipped with AI technology to provide maximum ease to users. You can use this tool to ensure a smooth workflow and boost your productivity.

### Why Filmora is Better Than GoPro Quik?

Filmora provides many features that GoPro Quik does not offer. Everyone needs solid arguments and valid reasons to reconsider their choices. Thus, here we have highlighted some proven and logical reasons to use Filmora instead of GoPro:

* The first and foremost thing you can see is Filmora’s intuitive interface. Anyone without any video editing background can use this tool effectively for their projects.
* Video editors need assistance while editing perfect shots. Filmora offers an [AI Copilot Editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) system as your editing assistant, which GoPro does not provide. It directs users to create high-quality videos.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

* GoPro Quik allows you to edit up to 1-minute videos. In contrast, Filmora doesn't restrict you from editing videos of a certain length.
* With Filmora AI, you can generate a customized script and turn it into a video. AI integration for unique content makes this tool better than GoPro Quik.
* Unlike GoPro Quik, getting personalized music tracks is possible with Filmora. It can create soundtracks that align with your project’s needs.
* **Slow-motion GoPro** can assist in speed-ramping videos for a smooth transition. Conversely, Filmora also offers an optical flow option to automate the [speed ramping](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
* Even GoPro Quik cannot remove vocals from the audio files. Using Filmora, this option is just a click away. It can automatically separate vocals from music tracks so you can dub high-quality videos.
* Using GoPro, users can share their videos on social media or export them anywhere. In comparison, Filmora allows you to adjust resolution, quality, project name, and destination.
* AI in Filmora can generate images with your prompts that will not claim legal rights. This service is unavailable in GoPro; it is just limited to video editing.
* Last but not least, Filmora can transform your text into engaging videos. By doing so, you can save the budget for actors, video editors, and other crew.

## Part 3: Make Better Slow-Motion Videos with Wondershare Filmora

Making a slow motion means spending cognitive effort and time on a project. Thus, video editors seek a reliable platform like **GoPro Hero 11,** [**which is slow motion**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Unfortunately, this editing app is outdated, and other better platforms are being developed. In search of the latest and easy-to-use video editor, use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

It is a video editing software with various powerful editing features compared with GoPro Quik. This platform can perform more tasks than trimming, merging, and splitting clips. Filmora is equipped with AI technology to provide maximum ease to users. You can use this tool to ensure a smooth workflow and boost your productivity.

### Why Filmora is Better Than GoPro Quik?

Filmora provides many features that GoPro Quik does not offer. Everyone needs solid arguments and valid reasons to reconsider their choices. Thus, here we have highlighted some proven and logical reasons to use Filmora instead of GoPro:

* The first and foremost thing you can see is Filmora’s intuitive interface. Anyone without any video editing background can use this tool effectively for their projects.
* Video editors need assistance while editing perfect shots. Filmora offers an [AI Copilot Editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) system as your editing assistant, which GoPro does not provide. It directs users to create high-quality videos.

* GoPro Quik allows you to edit up to 1-minute videos. In contrast, Filmora doesn't restrict you from editing videos of a certain length.
* With Filmora AI, you can generate a customized script and turn it into a video. AI integration for unique content makes this tool better than GoPro Quik.
* Unlike GoPro Quik, getting personalized music tracks is possible with Filmora. It can create soundtracks that align with your project’s needs.
* **Slow-motion GoPro** can assist in speed-ramping videos for a smooth transition. Conversely, Filmora also offers an optical flow option to automate the [speed ramping](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
* Even GoPro Quik cannot remove vocals from the audio files. Using Filmora, this option is just a click away. It can automatically separate vocals from music tracks so you can dub high-quality videos.
* Using GoPro, users can share their videos on social media or export them anywhere. In comparison, Filmora allows you to adjust resolution, quality, project name, and destination.
* AI in Filmora can generate images with your prompts that will not claim legal rights. This service is unavailable in GoPro; it is just limited to video editing.
* Last but not least, Filmora can transform your text into engaging videos. By doing so, you can save the budget for actors, video editors, and other crew.

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.

## In This Article, We Introduce You Our Top 5 Picks of Video to Ppt Converter

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

### 3.iSpring River

![ispring-river-poster.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ispring-river-poster.png)

**Price: $97 for a single lifetime license**

Installing iSpring River on your PC turns it into a PowerPoint add-on that you can use from the ribbon. This isn't a limitation since iSpring River allows you to convert PPT files to widely suitable video file formats like MP4 or AVI, even though it's not stand-alone computer software. In addition, you may choose the video size and compression parameters before each file conversion using the add-video on's settings.

All of the original PowerPoint presentation's animations and audio files, as well as transitions and font and text formatting, will be included in the final film. Video files exported from iSpring River may be uploaded straight to YouTube, but no other social media services such as Dropbox or Google Drive are supported.

##### Pros

It's quick and simple to use.

Upload YouTube videos directly from your computer's hard disc.

##### Cons

Cannot be used as a standalone application.

There isn't any support for high-definition video.

### 4.RZ PowerPoint Converter

![rz-powerpoint-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rz-powerpoint-poster.jpg)

**Price:** _There is a free version available, and prices begin at $29.99._

Using this sophisticated converter, any PPT files made with 2013 or previous versions of PowerPoint may be quickly converted to movies. RZ PowerPoint video to ppt converter also allows you to create HD video files that can be readily shared online, as well as files that can be burnt to DVDs.

Any current video playback device can play videos generated with this program, and the quality is so outstanding that you can play them on huge LCD displays. Though this video to ppt converter is accessible for free, its free edition lacks all of the capabilities that make this program an excellent alternative for professionals that prepare PowerPoint presentations on a consistent basis. It's possible to get the commercial edition of this Windows-based tool and have all of the multimedia you include in the presentations converted to video without losing any quality.

##### Pros

You may use this to burn DVDs.

All PowerPoint file types are supported.

##### Cons

However, basic PPT to video file conversion is only available in the free edition of the product.

There is no possibility to convert many files at once.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Price: A free trial is offered, and a single-user license is $249.**

There is much more to Camtasia Studio than simply a video to ppt converter in it. An unencumbered trial edition of this video editing program helps you create professional-looking films from PowerPoint presentations. Camtasia Studio's single-user license is a good alternative for those who just need to convert a few presentations for free, but if you're searching for a full-featured video to ppt converter, you should consider purchasing Camtasia.

When using the software's premium edition, you may add multimedia files, such as PowerPoint presentations and webcam footage to your final video project. With Camtasia Studio, you can easily post your films in nearly any video file type on social media.

##### Pros

With Camtasia Studio, adding transitions, callouts, or text effects is a cinch.

Advanced video editing tools are available.

##### Cons

Only 30 days are included in the free trial.

Expensive.

## Conclusions

When looking for the best PowerPoint conversion software, there are a lot of factors to consider. The output quality, the ability to use PowerPoint effects, compatibility with new devices, & one publishing are all key considerations. Get a free trial of iSpring Converter Pro, the number one choice on our list, if you need a dependable video to ppt converter that can handle any amount of slides and animations in your presentation.

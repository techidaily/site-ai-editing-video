I’m Maya of Mayang Dyosa on YouTube channel, vlogger since 2017 and I started my vlogging career out of boredom. I give up my managerial career so that I can watch over my child. That’s the time I thought of videoing what I’m doing at home and uploading it to YouTube for me to watch all over again, I accidentally made the videos public and I was surprised that there were viewers. Until I continued to upload and others requested the video what they want to see on my channel.

## Detailed Tutorial to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player

Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?

Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.

One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them.

## An Easier Way to Merge Videos in A Few Clicks

It's true that merging videos in VLC Media Player takes quite a few steps, so to speak. But is this the only editing program in which a similar operation can be performed? Of course not. Therefore, in our article, we decided to offer you an alternative, where you can also easily merge the videos. This is the famous [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , a software that is one of the easiest and most convenient to work with, especially for those who want to edit videos without having much experience in "complicated" software before.

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

## Fun & Easy Masking Tricks: Wondershare Filmora Tutorial

Masking is a video effect that allows you to cut out a scene and use the overlay to duplicate, hide, modify, or reveal your video footage. Just think of it as cutting something on your video so you can see what's in the bottom layer. So, without wasting time, let me show you how to mask a video in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Let's get started!

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### _Masking Trick 1:_

First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.

![place the camera facing the door](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/place-the-camera-facing-the-door.gif)

With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let's get editing with Wondershare Filmora.

![walk backwards](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-backwards.gif)

Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.

![fire up wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-1.jpg)

Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap **Add Freeze Frame**. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

![proceed to hide the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-2.jpg)

Step 3 Next, click the **Effect** button and find the **Image Mask** effect in the **Utility** folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.

![click the effect button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-3.jpg)

Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under **Video Effects**. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the **Invert Mask** checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking **Ok**.

![double-click the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-4.jpg)

Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.

![unhide the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-5.jpg)

### _Masking Trick: 2_

In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.

![create a subject walking in and outside a tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/tree-with-clear-background.gif)

Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they'll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That's all!

![film the subject walking from one side of the tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-away-from-the-tree.gif)

Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.

![import the clip on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-6.jpg)

Step 2 Next, click **Effects**, choose **Utility**, then drag the **Image Mask** effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select **Video Effects**, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.

Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip's timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.

![adjust the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-7.jpg)

Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.

![play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-8.jpg)

### _Masking Trick 3:_

For this masking illusion, we'll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.

![create a video with a subject jumping over a house](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/set-the-camera-low.gif)

Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.

![tell your subject to walk to the marker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/jump-in-front-of-camera.gif)

Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

![import the clip into filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-9.jpg)

Step 2 Now, it's time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the **Utility** folder under **Effects** and choose **Image Mask**. Click the **Invert Mask** box to invert the mask.

![customize the clip with a mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-10.jpg)

Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under **Video Effects**. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.

![double-click the video track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-11.jpg)

Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.

![unhide the first track on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-12.jpg)

Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.

With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let's get editing with Wondershare Filmora.

![walk backwards](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-backwards.gif)

Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.

![fire up wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-1.jpg)

Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap **Add Freeze Frame**. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

![proceed to hide the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-2.jpg)

Step 3 Next, click the **Effect** button and find the **Image Mask** effect in the **Utility** folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.

![click the effect button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-3.jpg)

Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under **Video Effects**. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the **Invert Mask** checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking **Ok**.

![double-click the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-4.jpg)

Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.

![unhide the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-5.jpg)

### _Masking Trick: 2_

In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.

![create a subject walking in and outside a tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/tree-with-clear-background.gif)

Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they'll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That's all!

![film the subject walking from one side of the tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-away-from-the-tree.gif)

Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.

![import the clip on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-6.jpg)

Step 2 Next, click **Effects**, choose **Utility**, then drag the **Image Mask** effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select **Video Effects**, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.

Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip's timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.

![adjust the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-7.jpg)

Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.

![play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-8.jpg)

### _Masking Trick 3:_

For this masking illusion, we'll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.

![create a video with a subject jumping over a house](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/set-the-camera-low.gif)

Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.

![tell your subject to walk to the marker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/jump-in-front-of-camera.gif)

Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

![import the clip into filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-9.jpg)

Step 2 Now, it's time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the **Utility** folder under **Effects** and choose **Image Mask**. Click the **Invert Mask** box to invert the mask.

![customize the clip with a mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-10.jpg)

Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under **Video Effects**. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.

![double-click the video track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-11.jpg)

Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.

![unhide the first track on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-12.jpg)

Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.

![play the video to see your subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-13.jpg)

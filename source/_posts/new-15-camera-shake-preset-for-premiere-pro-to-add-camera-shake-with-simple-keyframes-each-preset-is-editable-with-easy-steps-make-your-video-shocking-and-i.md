![a good storage option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-url-for-videos-4.jpg)

This is where cloud storage comes to play. There are different cloud disk or storage platforms where you can **upload video to link** and share your videos with others. For example, Google storage or Google Drive. So, let's know the process of uploading a video to Google Drive.

* First, visit your Google Drive Account and then click on the new option.
* Now, you need to click on File Upload and then select the video that you want to upload.
* You can now see the selected video uploading in the screen's lower left corner. It will take some time.
* Once done, Google Drive will begin processing the video.
* Once your video is available on Google Drive, you can move it to different folders or change the name.

Now, let's talk about how to generate a link to your video and share that link with others.

* Open your Google Drive account.
* Choose the video that you want to share and right-click on it.
* Now, you need to click on the Get Link option.
* Then, choose the Anyone with the Link option from the viewer option.
* Now, click on the Copy Link option, and you can now share that link with anyone you want.

There are different reasons that make cloud storage options a perfect choice for video creators or other users. For example:

* You don't have to worry about data loss.
* Cloud storage is highly scalable.
* There will be no space or storage limit
* The users can enjoy real-time video content updates
* One can access and share videos using any device.

However, some of the cloud storage platforms are not free to use. You will get up to 10GB to 20GB for free. For more storage limits, you will have to buy a subscription plan. For example, if you are using Dropbox, then you will have to pay around USD 20 per month to get up to 3TB of storage.

Besides, there are some content restrictions that you will have to consider. You are not allowed to upload videos that support malicious attacks, hate speech, graphic violence, predatory behavior or videos that promote any dangerous behavior. Besides, the platforms support certain types of video formats, such as OGG, WebM files, WMV, MTS, AVI, and WMV. FLV, 3GPP, MPEG 4, MOV and other file formats.

If you are looking for some free cloud storage platforms, then you can give Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, NeXT cloud, pCloud, Amazon Cloud Drive and OneDrive a try.

## Elevate Your Designs with Feather Shapes in After Effects

Feathering shapes in After Effects can greatly enhance your designs' overall look and feel. This technique involves creating a soft, blurred edge around the shapes, which adds a sense of depth and dimension. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced After Effects user, understanding how to feather shapes is a valuable skill to have in your arsenal.

This guide will cover everything you need about feathering shapes in After Effects. From the basics to advanced techniques, you'll learn how to add a professional touch to your designs and take your skills to the next level.

Whether you're creating a logo, animation, or visual effect, the ability to feather shapes will help you achieve the desired look and feel for your project. So, let's dive in and explore the world of feathering in After Effects!

## What Is Mask Edge Feather in After Effects?

Mask Edge Feather in After Effects is a feature that enables you to create a soft or blurred transition between the masked and unmasked areas of your composition. The mask feather setting can be found in the properties and is measured in pixels. Increasing the feather value increases the softness or blurriness of the mask's edges, creating a smoother transition between the masked and unmasked parts of the image.

One of the key benefits of feathering masks is that it allows you to blend the masked object with its background, making the effect look more natural and convincing. The mask feather tool can also create custom feather shapes anywhere along the edge of the mask. To access the mask feather tool, switch to the pen tool by pressing the "**G**" key and selecting the feather pen.

The mask edge feather feature in After Effects is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you achieve a wide range of creative effects. Whether you're creating an animation or visual effect, or want to add a professional touch to your designs, understanding how to use the mask feather tool is an essential skill in your After Effects toolkit.

## Part 1: Why Should You Look Forward to Zoom Your YouTube Video?

There can be various causes to **zoom** **in** **on** **YouTube** videos as users can clearly see hidden information and details from the video through it. For instance, if you are reviewing a trailer of a particular movie on your YouTube channel, you would be required to **zoom in YouTube** video many times. For breaking down the trailer, you would need to focus on the backgrounds, props, and other hidden details that are only possible through zooming in and out of the videos.

Moreover, if you are watching a demonstration of the chemistry practical on YouTube videos, readings on the apparatus may not be apparent in it. So here, you can also read and notice precise complicated readings on the videos by just zooming in. Also, in other scenarios, you can read the product's description in makeup tutorials by using the option of zooming in and out.

To sum up, every regular user of YouTube must know how to zoom in on YouTube videos so that he can quickly focus on the details with a single click.

### Method 1: Zoom In and Out on the YouTube Video Player

Are you looking for easier ways to zoom in and out of the YouTube video? YouTube gives the option on its player for viewing the videos in two modes: Theatre mode and full mode. Through theater mode, you can watch your video in a comparatively zoomed manner, whereas, in full screen, you can watch the video on a full screen of the monitor.

In this particular method, we will provide simple and easy steps for zooming in on the YouTube video player:

**Step 1:** Navigate to the YouTube app on your device browser, such as Google Chrome. On its search box, enter the video you want to watch.

![search for youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Press Enter, and you will see various options related to your desired video. Click on any particular video to watch.

**Step 3:** On the YouTube video player, you would be able to see two screen mode options on the right side. The first option is "Full Screen" mode, through which you can enjoy watching your videos on a full monitor screen. The second option is "Theatre Mode," which will display the video in a cinematic look by zooming in to some extent. Explore these options to observe the small details in your YouTube video closely.

![use youtube player modes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-youtube-3.jpg)

### Method 2: Zoom In and Out with Browser Zoom Features

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

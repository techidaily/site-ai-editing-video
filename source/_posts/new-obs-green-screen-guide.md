## OBS Green Screen Guide

OBS Studio is a free and open-source app for screen-casting and live streaming. Written in C/C++ and built with Qt, OBS Studio provides real-time capture, scene composition, recording, encoding, and broadcasting via the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).It can stream Videos to any RTMP supporting destination including YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and Facebook.

You only need one green screen software – OBS. The reason why OBS is the most recommended for streaming is because once you have set it up properly, you can do literally anything you can think of with the software (either with or without added plug-ins).

## Chroma Key Settings in OBS

Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.

Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:

1. Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.
2. Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the [official website](https://obsproject.com/) and install the software. Open OBS and let the Auto-Configuration Wizard optimize the software’s settings based on your hardware.
3. Now you can add a video source.
4. Right-click on the video source you’ve created and select Filter.
5. Click the + button under the Effects Filters section and select Chroma Key.
6. Type in a name for this effect layer.
7. After you add a chroma key, OBS will automatically create and adjust the baseline settings for the filter. You can experiment with the sliders and settle when you are satisfied with the result.
8. Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.
9. If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.

Pro tip:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.

02 [Need to Color Match in Video? There's an App for That...](#Part 2)

## Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample

We will be discussing three methods in which you will get the perfect answer to the question of how can I **match my paint color** perfectly. So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.

### 01**Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample**

The following steps will help you attain **Perfect Match Paint** without the necessity of a sample.

**Step Clean the print area**

The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.

Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.

![clean area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-1.jpg)

**Step Scraping off**

The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for **paint matching near me**. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.

And after you **find paint colors** that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the **best way to match paint**.

![scrapping off](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-2.jpg)

**Step Bring the object if possible**

The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a **car paint match near me**. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.

### 02**Method 2 Using a sample**

Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.

**Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue**

This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, **dupli color paint match** and have the perfect color matching done.

And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.

**Step 2: Bring home more than one sample**

You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.

So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.

![samples color match](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-3.jpg)

**Step 3: stick the sample and compare.**

This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.

It helps better compare and matches the sample's colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.

![taping samples](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-4.jpg)

**Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall**

It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.

![matching color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-5.jpeg)

### 03**Method 3 with the help of apps**

Since the technology has advanced in the most progressive way possible, you can easily match the paint colors through an application. So now, we will be listing down the steps that will help you match the paints with the help of mobile applications. The steps are given as follows.

**Step 1 Install the application**

You will find numerous mobile applications meant for matching paint colors. Opt for the ones you find the best and most efficient. Download it and install it on your phone. If you have used a renowned brand for painting, you can use their application. For example, you can use **Asian paints color matching** if you have used their brand of paints before.

![color matching app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-6.jpg)

**Step 2 Scan the shade**

Now, even the original paint shade. There are factors such as lighting, angel and shadow that you must remover to consider while you scan the color of the original sample.

![scanning shade in app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-7.jpg)

**Step 3 Paint the sample**

To be most precise and sure, paint the sample of the paint you have chosen. It will be a way of double-checking your division and ensuring a perfect paint match.

![paint sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-8.png)

It is another optional step, but there will be absolutely no doubt in the precision of paint matching if you use it. You can either borrow or buy a paint scanner. If you are not planning to paint again soon, it is best to borrow the paint scanner.

## How To Add Text In After Effects

In almost every video you come across, you will see text added to the video in different parts. There are various reasons why adding text to videos becomes a necessity. First of all, you can highlight the underlying message or key points in your video. Along with audio and video, the viewers will have another cue point in the form of text that they can retain in their memory for longer. You add animated texts to video to make the video interesting to watch and break the monotony of visual cues only.

Besides, you may have to want credits and add intro as well as outro to your video where adding text is almost a necessity. Text can help your viewer get the context of your video and make sense of the content. After Effects is a popular video editor thanks to its visual effects, text animation animations, and instant video enhancement tools. We will illustrate the different ways of adding text in After Effects in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Add Text in After Effects with Horizontal Type Tool

Once you have imported your video clip into the Timeline, there are several ways you can add text to your video. First of all, you can right-click on the Timeline and select New> Text to create an empty text layer and add any text you want. Similarly, you can go to Layer> New> Text option to do the same. But the easiest way of adding text in After Effects is by using Horizontal Type Tool. Here are the steps on how you can add text in AE with the type tool.

Step1Once you have imported your video into the Timeline, click on Horizontal Type Tool located in the top bar to add any text. You can press Ctrl+T(Windows) or Command+H(Mac) to get it instantly.

![horizontal type tool ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/horizontal-type-tool-ae.jpg)

Step2Click on the video where you want to place the text and type your desired text there. After you are done adding your text, press Enter key in Num pad to exit out of the text field in the video.

![add text field ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-text-field-ae.jpg)

Step3This will automatically create a text layer on Timeline. You can now move the text and place it anywhere you want. You can also modify the text style and add animation which we will illustrate in the next section.

## Part 2\. Use the Character Panel to Edit Text in AE

When you select Type tool and add your desired text, you get a default style for the text. It is most likely that you have to modify the text style such as changing color, font, and size to fit in your video seamlessly. That is when you have to visit the Character Panel. Character Panel is where you get to edit the font of the text you have typed, increase or decrease the font size, change the font color, and much more. Apart from that, you can increase the spacing between lines when your text is a paragraph instead of a few words. Here are the steps to use Character Panel to edit text in AE.

Step1Once you have typed your text using Horizontal Type tool on the video, click on the text.

Step2Go to Character panel located in the right side of the screen. If it is minimized, click on the panel to expand it.

![character panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/character-panel-after-effects.jpg)

Step3The first option in the panel is the font of the text. By the side of the font is the text color. You can use the color picker tool to choose any color as per your preference.

![choose font color ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-font-color-ae.jpg)

Step4Below the font, you can select the font style such as regular, bold, italics, and likewise. The subsequent part is to change the font size and adjust vertical spacing between lines and horizontal spacing between characters.

![select font style ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/select-font-style-ae.jpg)

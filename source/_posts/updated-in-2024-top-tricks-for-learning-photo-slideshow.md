## Step by Step to Rotate Videos Using Handbrake

Handbrake is a video editing tool that allows you to rotate videos. It is a free and open source software that is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is used to convert video files from one format to another. You can use it to compress videos, add subtitles, or create chapters. It also allows you to rotate videos in different directions. You can use it to fix videos that are not aligned properly or that have been filmed upside down. A handbrake is a popular tool because it is easy to use and it has a variety of features.

## Step-by-step on how to rotate videos using Handbrake

When you import a video into the Handbrake software, it will by default be in a "landscape" orientation, with the long edge of the video oriented horizontally. If you want to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise so that it appears "vertical," or if you want to rotate it 180 degrees so that it is upside down, you can do so by following these two steps:

Step 1: Open the Handbrake software and import your video.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-1.png)

Step 2: Click on the "Dimensions" tab at the top of the Handbrake window.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-2.png)

Step 3: Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, click on one of the options in the "Rotate" menu.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-3.png)

Step 4: If you want to rotate a video 90 degrees counterclockwise, select "90 Degrees CW (Counter-Clockwise)." If you want to rotate the video 180 degrees so that it is upside down, select "180 Degrees."

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-4.png)

Step 5: Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-5.png)

The Handbrake software also offers a "Flip" option which you can do after rotating it, which allows you to slip the video after rotating it. To use this option, follow these steps:

Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, Go to Rotation and choose the degrees that best is best for your rotation requirements.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-6.png)

Click on "Flip" to flip your video horizontally.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-7.png)

Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

Both of these methods for rotating videos are easy to use and produce good results. Experiment with them to see which method works best for you.

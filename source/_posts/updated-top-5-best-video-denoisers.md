## Top 5 Best Video Denoisers

We all know that our recorded videos are not always perfect – when we use a mobile phone or digital cameras to shoot, our clips may contain hiss, compression and particles. These are the impurities that make our videos look uncomfortable, but it’s not a final result impossible to altar – help can come in the form of several video denoise software.

Editing is the guarantor that makes sure we can do different operations and achieve our desired results – computer programs, tools, opportunities that give us a hand in this process are kind of endless.

So, sometimes it’s really difficult to choose among so many options that come into waves. And if we choose our preferred ways, some people might not agree with us. Even so that it is quite subjective, we can still explain which tools and software we like to modify our videos, and fight with the impurities they have.

It looks amateur if the video is grainy, even if it is night shooting. We can get rid of the noise when we add lights or shoot in well-lit places, but there are some situations we can just depend on the ISO. So, for these grainy videos, there is a thing called denoising – when you get rid of the grains and make your shots as clear as possible. There are different ways to do this, and that happens in different software as well. What are the 5 best video denoisers in 2024 for us to work with? That, as we have already mentioned, might be something very subjective, but here is our selection: Wondershare Filmora, Neat Video, Shotcut, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve

**Wondershare Filmora X**

Wondershare Filmora X offers to change our damaged scene into something more acceptable. How to operate it? - You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-1.jpg)

This ensures you see the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-2.jpg)

Reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

**Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise**

We already explained how video denoising works, and we will go on with our selection and explanatory article about the process, but, as we are on the Filmora topic, we might as well mention that denoising might mean another thing too – which, in this case, regards audio background noise. It means to remove unwanted hum from the audio in order for it to become more hearable. So, doing this in Wondershare Filmora works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:

Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-3.jpg)

Double-click on the audio track and have access to the editing panel, where you can see Remove background noise – it is not needed to emphasize what this option does for you!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-4.jpg)

That’s it – you are done, but keep in mind that there is a second way to achieve the same result as well, but this in case you don’t want to detach the audio: Double-click on the video clip in the timeline, the editing panel opens, so switch to Audio. Checking the box next to Remove background noise will show that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, and of course, you can choose to your liking!

If the voice recording doesn’t sound natural anymore, you can do the following: Click on Customize and Customize Equalizer window will open.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-5.jpg)

On the left, you can see the low tunes, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often on the left, so you can lower them to get rid of them, but in order to have a more natural sound, raise the middle ones a little – and you are done when you are content with the sound!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-6.jpg)

So, hmm… back to the original topic – denoising a video, shall we?..

**Neat video**

Neat Video kind of, speaks for itself… it is a powerful video editing tool suitable for Windows, macOS and Linux. It aims to reduce the digital noise, flicker, dust, scratches and other defects in the captured videos to improve the visual quality of the videos.

It is a plug-in for Premiere Pro, that does more or less what the product noise says: it makes grainy video look neater. It’s very easy to use and

How to do that in Neat Video? Here are the steps:

Find the clip you want to reduce the noise of and search for the neat video effect in the Effects Panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-7.jpg)

The video editors mostly use the SR version of it, because it seems faster and has kind of a better performance.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-8.jpg)

Then, you’ll have to drag the neat video plug-in to the clip to your choosing, take your attention to the Effect Controls panel on the left, and find: fx Reduce Noise v5 (SR) – press the button saying Prepare and this will open up the Build button as well, which wil open the Neat video effect window.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-9.jpg)

There, you’ll need to click on the Auto Profile. Selection window will appear, which you can move around the scene and resize, in order to select the noisy area of your footage. It is recommended to find the darkest or grainiest area there and select judging by this.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-10.jpg)

On the left side, you will find Filter Settings: under Spatial, you can play with the Noise Reduction Amount and Noise Level.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-11.jpg)

Then, you will hit Apply and – done, you can instantly see the results!

**Shotcut**

What about Shotcut? It is a free, open-source and cross-platform video denoiser for Windows operating system. It is also an outstanding video editor with trimming, splitting, color correction and other tools.

In order to reduce the noise there, do the following: first off, find filters, open that window and type in: Noise. This will open the options, and several of them are for noise reduction.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-12.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-13.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-14.jpg)

Choose Reduce Noise: Wavelet, add it to the Video and then feel free to modify the settings, such as: Decompose, Threshold, Percent. You can check and uncheck the effect in order to see the before-after difference. Then, click Apply button and it is ready to go!

Anyway, you can also try other similar effects such as Reduce Noise: HQDN3D and Reduce Noise: Smart Blur.

**Adobe Premiere Pro**

Even though we discussed video denoising in Adobe Premier Pro but with the help of a plug-in called Neat Video, reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved without the plug-in as well, through using effect which is called Median. And, Premiere Pro kind of deserves to be mentioned, so, let’s go for it!

Add the desired footage into the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Then, find the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found –drag and drop the effect to the clip.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-15.jpg)

The Median should modify the grainiest parts of the whole clip, so in order to do this, we need to use masks. In the Effects Control panel, select the mask shape for the clip – the options are: rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With Pen tool, you move the Mask around the screen and resize it – the covered area will be affected.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-16.jpg)

If you change Feather setting to 100, the effect will lose a sharp edge and instead, there will be a smooth border.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-17.jpg)

So, you might think it is needed to repeat these steps several time to create masks in different areas, in order to cover all of the grainy space of the scene.

And, at last, to reduce the noise, adjust the effect settings.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-18.jpg)

Actually, Median just blurs the grainy parts, without directly taking them away. Lastly, you can get to know the Radios settings, which will help you to achieve your most desired look!

**Davinci Resolve**

DaVinci Resolve is also worth mentioning in this list, in a way because it is also different from other video editors. Let’s see how it works and, meanwhile, differs:

Add the footage into the timeline. Find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-19.jpg)

There, MediaIn1 and MediaOut1 will appear, and first, click on MediaIn1, - the scene will be shown in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find Remove Noise (RN). Click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner there is an Inspector, which opens all the properties you can modify.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-20.jpg)

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar there is channel icons. Open it and click on red, but don’t get alarmed when your footage turns black and white – it’s just for a while. Go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-21.jpg)

This step helps remove grain from the red channel. Then repeat the same for green and blue channels. After finishing go to the same channel button and set it to “back to color”. The clip will be colorized again and now be clearer, compared to the first viewer.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-22.jpg)

So, Evrika – we hot to know 5 best video denoisers in 2024, with the addition of audio background noise removal in Wondershare Filmora – hope you enjoyed it, and hope this will help you create better videos for yourself and your viewers!

This ensures you see the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-2.jpg)

Reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

There, MediaIn1 and MediaOut1 will appear, and first, click on MediaIn1, - the scene will be shown in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find Remove Noise (RN). Click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner there is an Inspector, which opens all the properties you can modify.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-20.jpg)

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar there is channel icons. Open it and click on red, but don’t get alarmed when your footage turns black and white – it’s just for a while. Go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-21.jpg)

This step helps remove grain from the red channel. Then repeat the same for green and blue channels. After finishing go to the same channel button and set it to “back to color”. The clip will be colorized again and now be clearer, compared to the first viewer.

So, Evrika – we hot to know 5 best video denoisers in 2024, with the addition of audio background noise removal in Wondershare Filmora – hope you enjoyed it, and hope this will help you create better videos for yourself and your viewers!

This ensures you see the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-2.jpg)

Reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

**Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise**

We already explained how video denoising works, and we will go on with our selection and explanatory article about the process, but, as we are on the Filmora topic, we might as well mention that denoising might mean another thing too – which, in this case, regards audio background noise. It means to remove unwanted hum from the audio in order for it to become more hearable. So, doing this in Wondershare Filmora works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:

Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-3.jpg)

Double-click on the audio track and have access to the editing panel, where you can see Remove background noise – it is not needed to emphasize what this option does for you!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-4.jpg)

That’s it – you are done, but keep in mind that there is a second way to achieve the same result as well, but this in case you don’t want to detach the audio: Double-click on the video clip in the timeline, the editing panel opens, so switch to Audio. Checking the box next to Remove background noise will show that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, and of course, you can choose to your liking!

If the voice recording doesn’t sound natural anymore, you can do the following: Click on Customize and Customize Equalizer window will open.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-5.jpg)

On the left, you can see the low tunes, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often on the left, so you can lower them to get rid of them, but in order to have a more natural sound, raise the middle ones a little – and you are done when you are content with the sound!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-6.jpg)

So, hmm… back to the original topic – denoising a video, shall we?..

**Neat video**

Neat Video kind of, speaks for itself… it is a powerful video editing tool suitable for Windows, macOS and Linux. It aims to reduce the digital noise, flicker, dust, scratches and other defects in the captured videos to improve the visual quality of the videos.

It is a plug-in for Premiere Pro, that does more or less what the product noise says: it makes grainy video look neater. It’s very easy to use and

How to do that in Neat Video? Here are the steps:

Find the clip you want to reduce the noise of and search for the neat video effect in the Effects Panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-7.jpg)

The video editors mostly use the SR version of it, because it seems faster and has kind of a better performance.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-8.jpg)

Then, you’ll have to drag the neat video plug-in to the clip to your choosing, take your attention to the Effect Controls panel on the left, and find: fx Reduce Noise v5 (SR) – press the button saying Prepare and this will open up the Build button as well, which wil open the Neat video effect window.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-9.jpg)

There, you’ll need to click on the Auto Profile. Selection window will appear, which you can move around the scene and resize, in order to select the noisy area of your footage. It is recommended to find the darkest or grainiest area there and select judging by this.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-10.jpg)

On the left side, you will find Filter Settings: under Spatial, you can play with the Noise Reduction Amount and Noise Level.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-11.jpg)

Then, you will hit Apply and – done, you can instantly see the results!

**Shotcut**

What about Shotcut? It is a free, open-source and cross-platform video denoiser for Windows operating system. It is also an outstanding video editor with trimming, splitting, color correction and other tools.

In order to reduce the noise there, do the following: first off, find filters, open that window and type in: Noise. This will open the options, and several of them are for noise reduction.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-12.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-13.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-14.jpg)

Choose Reduce Noise: Wavelet, add it to the Video and then feel free to modify the settings, such as: Decompose, Threshold, Percent. You can check and uncheck the effect in order to see the before-after difference. Then, click Apply button and it is ready to go!

Anyway, you can also try other similar effects such as Reduce Noise: HQDN3D and Reduce Noise: Smart Blur.

**Adobe Premiere Pro**

Even though we discussed video denoising in Adobe Premier Pro but with the help of a plug-in called Neat Video, reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved without the plug-in as well, through using effect which is called Median. And, Premiere Pro kind of deserves to be mentioned, so, let’s go for it!

Add the desired footage into the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Then, find the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found –drag and drop the effect to the clip.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-15.jpg)

The Median should modify the grainiest parts of the whole clip, so in order to do this, we need to use masks. In the Effects Control panel, select the mask shape for the clip – the options are: rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With Pen tool, you move the Mask around the screen and resize it – the covered area will be affected.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-16.jpg)

If you change Feather setting to 100, the effect will lose a sharp edge and instead, there will be a smooth border.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-17.jpg)

So, you might think it is needed to repeat these steps several time to create masks in different areas, in order to cover all of the grainy space of the scene.

And, at last, to reduce the noise, adjust the effect settings.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-18.jpg)

Actually, Median just blurs the grainy parts, without directly taking them away. Lastly, you can get to know the Radios settings, which will help you to achieve your most desired look!

**Davinci Resolve**

DaVinci Resolve is also worth mentioning in this list, in a way because it is also different from other video editors. Let’s see how it works and, meanwhile, differs:

Add the footage into the timeline. Find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-19.jpg)

There, MediaIn1 and MediaOut1 will appear, and first, click on MediaIn1, - the scene will be shown in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find Remove Noise (RN). Click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner there is an Inspector, which opens all the properties you can modify.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-20.jpg)

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar there is channel icons. Open it and click on red, but don’t get alarmed when your footage turns black and white – it’s just for a while. Go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-21.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-22.jpg)

So, Evrika – we hot to know 5 best video denoisers in 2024, with the addition of audio background noise removal in Wondershare Filmora – hope you enjoyed it, and hope this will help you create better videos for yourself and your viewers!

01 [What Is AR in Teaching?](#Part 1)

02 [5 Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education](#Part 2)

03 [10 Creative AR Teaching Examples](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?

For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

![ar in teaching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-1.jpg)

If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home/office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating **Augmented Reality in classrooms** and the education sector.

## Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education

### 01No Special Equipment Required

One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.

### 02Better Student Engagement

Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.

### 03Practical Learning

Another major advantage of **Augmented Reality in teaching** is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.

### 04Combined Learning

Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With **Augmented Reality in schools,** students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.

### 05Affordable

Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.

## Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples

Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, **AR classrooms** have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality in classrooms**.

### 01Exploring the Universe With Skyview

Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?

![skyview app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-2.jpg)

![mondly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-3.jpg)

### 04Froggipedia

This is where things get interesting. Froggipedia is a great example of **Augmented Reality in teaching**. It’s basically a smartphone app that lets users explore the internal organs of a frog in a virtual environment. It means students would no longer have to get involved in the mess that dissecting an actual frog creates in the classroom and still get familiar with each organ easily.

![froggipedia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-4.jpg)

### 05Effective Marketing

Another example of **Augmented Reality in the teaching** world has nothing to do with learning, but the marketing aspect of the industry. With AR-based platforms, universities and colleges can market their brands among the target consumers and get a higher number of applications in return. They can launch digital publications and AR-powered videos to maximize engagement and achieve the desired results through their marketing campaigns.

![effecting marketing with ar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-5.jpg)

### 06Virtual Classrooms

The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of virtual classrooms as many schools still haven’t resumed physical classes to restrict the virus's spread. In VR classrooms, mixed reality - a combination of VR and AR - can help students stay engaged, even if they are sitting apart from each other. Virtual Classrooms will eliminate boredom from remote learning and keep the engagement level high for students.

![virtual classrooms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-6.jpg)

### 07Secure Training

As we mentioned earlier, AR integration makes training more effective and risk-free. For example, with Microsoft Holo-lens, medical students understand the inner anatomy of the human body and understand complex procedures without having to risk a patient’s life. Once they are confident and know about each organ, they can move towards the next procedure and gain expertise in the particular domain more effectively.

### 08Google Expeditions

For a student, exploring the world is a great way to familiarize himself with different cultures. But, it’s not always possible for young kids to go on trips alone. Well, not anymore! Thanks to virtual tour platforms like Google Expeditions, teachers can take their students on virtual trips to different corners of the world, be it Mount Everest Base Camp or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

![google expeditions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-7.jpg)

### 09Augmented Reality in Museums

The younger generation craves interactivity. They don’t have the time to read brochures in a Museum. That’s the reason why many Museums have started to launch AR-powered tech to keep the visitors engaged and let them learn various historical facts more precisely. For instance, in a nature-themed museum, visitors can experience digital animals and their position in history.

### 10Virtual Speech

Not particularly an Augmented Reality (AR) example, Virtual Speech is a combination of AR and VR that lets users virtually practice their public speaking skills without going on a real stage. This is a great tool to fight stage fear and speak with confidence in front of an actual crowd.

![virtual speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-8.jpg)

## Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?

For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

![ar in teaching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-1.jpg)

If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home/office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating **Augmented Reality in classrooms** and the education sector.

## Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education

### 01No Special Equipment Required

One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.

### 02Better Student Engagement

Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.

### 03Practical Learning

Another major advantage of **Augmented Reality in teaching** is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.

### 04Combined Learning

Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With **Augmented Reality in schools,** students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.

### 05Affordable

Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.

## Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples

Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, **AR classrooms** have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality in classrooms**.

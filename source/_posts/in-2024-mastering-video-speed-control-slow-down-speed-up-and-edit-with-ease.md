![synced video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png)

After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![unscaled photo in the main play window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png)

To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:

![scaling of the photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png)

**Add a Background Blur Effect**

In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Effects** tab above the import window and search for **Blur**.
* Download the blur effect that suits you best and then **drag** the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.

You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.

![photo with blurred background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png)

* Search the **Fade** option from the Transitions tab above the import window

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

![adding a fade effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png)

Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!

##### Step6 Add The Music

You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:

* Click on the **Audio** icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.
* Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.
* Then add it to the timeline's audio track.

**Add Beat Detection**

To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:

* Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.
* You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.
* Click on **Beat detection**.

![adding beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png)

* Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.

**Match The Video With The Audio Markers**

To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:

![matching the video with the audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png)

* Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.
* For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.
* Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.

![synced video with audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png)

After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![unscaled photo in the main play window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png)

To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:

* **Double-click** on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.
* Go into the **Transform** Here you can see multiple settings.
* Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.

![scaling of the photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png)

**Add a Background Blur Effect**

In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Click on the **Effects** tab above the import window and search for **Blur**.
* Download the blur effect that suits you best and then **drag** the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.

You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.

![photo with blurred background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png)

##### Step8 Add a Transition

##### Step9 Add the Effects and Filters

![adding a black screen at the end](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-19.png)

**Fade out The Audio**

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

1. **Cutting the video**

Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.

With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.

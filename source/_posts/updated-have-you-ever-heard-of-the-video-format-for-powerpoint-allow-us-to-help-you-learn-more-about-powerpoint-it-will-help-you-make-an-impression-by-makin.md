## Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?

It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist's ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.

You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:

### 1\. Choose an image that you like

It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.

### 2\. Break the image down into single-color sections

This is the part where "careful planning" comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.

### 3\. Obtain the necessary resources

You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.

### 4\. Start building

Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece's complexity.

## Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art

There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.

* Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.
* Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you'll need to make your pixel art.
* Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.

### 3\. Pixel Art Builder

In this mobile app, you can create Minecraft pixel art from the palm of your hand.

You can draw on grids rather than in real pixels to help you be more precise with your art. It has a very easy-to-use interface, and it is completely free.

Many of its key features are, for example, exporting images, dynamic size adjustment of the ability to save in several different formats. Its tools range from the regular pencil to eraser, paint bucket, line and circle drawer, move/zoom function, color wheel, and eyedropper.

## Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?

It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist's ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.

You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:

### 1\. Choose an image that you like

It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.

### 2\. Break the image down into single-color sections

This is the part where "careful planning" comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.

### 3\. Obtain the necessary resources

You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.

### 4\. Start building

Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece's complexity.

## Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art

There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.

* Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.
* Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you'll need to make your pixel art.
* Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.
* If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.

### Conclusion

Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.

Color grading can be a tedious process, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to achieve the desired result. That’s where a LUT can come in handy. So, what is a LUT?

LUT stands for “look up table.” Simply put, a LUT is a color preset that you can apply to your video footage to speed up the color grading process. While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.

## Part 5: Bonus! Use Filmora – Easy to Use Video Editor for Color LUTs

Besides Final Cut Pro and PowerDirector, Filmora is another excellent video editing software that you can use to apply LUTs to your video.

Designed for beginners and intermediate users, Filmora is an intuitive yet powerful video editing software.

For instance, you can apply 3D LUTs to your video using Filmora. Unlike 1D LUTs, which can only control one value setting, 3D LUTs can allow you to control various value settings. As a result, 3D LUTs can give you more control over specific color values in your video.

Here’s how you can apply LUTs using Filmora:

### Step 1\.  Import the Footage

Launch Filmora and choose New Project. In the New Project window that opens, import the video you want to apply the LUT to by clicking on Import and selecting one of the drop-down options.

### Step 2\.  Add the Video to the Timeline

Drag and drop the video into your project’s timeline.

### Step 3\.  Open the Color Tab

Double click the video on the timeline to select it. Once it’s selected, go to the top left panel and click on the color tab.

![use lut in filmora - open color tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-5.jpg)

### Step 4\. Apply a LUT to the Video

Under the color tab, navigate to the 3D LUT option and select one of the available options in the 3D LUT drop-down menu to apply a LUT.

Many LUTs are named after popular TV shows and series whose visual styles they mimic, such as Batman, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more.

Once you apply a LUT, you can see your changes in the Preview Window. Besides using the preset LUTs, Filmora also allows you to use custom LUTs. Instead of choosing one of the presets, click on the Load New LUT option to import your custom LUT into Filmora.

### Step 5\. Make Fine Adjustments

Once you apply a LUT, Filmora can allow you to make further modifications to the video. Click on the Advanced button at the bottom of the color tab to view advanced color correction options.

In the new window that opens, you can adjust several things, such as color, light, HSL, and more. You can also choose from a variety of other available presets.

![use lut in filmora - make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-6.jpg)

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

Color grading can be a tedious process, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to achieve the desired result. That’s where a LUT can come in handy. So, what is a LUT?

LUT stands for “look up table.” Simply put, a LUT is a color preset that you can apply to your video footage to speed up the color grading process. While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.

### Step 1\.  Launch PowerDirector

Open PowerDirector and select Full Mode.

### Step 2\.  Import Media

Click the import button and then select Import Media Folder to import the video footage you want to apply the Leeming LUT to.

### Step 3\.  Add Footage to Timeline

Drag and drop the imported video footage into your project’s timeline.

### Step 4\.  Select the Fix/Enhance Option

Click on the video clip on the timeline and choose the Fix/Enhance option.

### Step 5\.  Select the Color Presets & CLUTs Option

In the top left window that opens above the timeline, select the Color Presets & CLUTs option under Enhance.

### Step 6\.  Apply the Leeming LUT to the Footage

Click on the import button in the panel to import the Leeming LUT file. Once imported, apply it to give your video a more vibrant look.

## Part 5: Bonus! Use Filmora – Easy to Use Video Editor for Color LUTs

Besides Final Cut Pro and PowerDirector, Filmora is another excellent video editing software that you can use to apply LUTs to your video.

Designed for beginners and intermediate users, Filmora is an intuitive yet powerful video editing software.

For instance, you can apply 3D LUTs to your video using Filmora. Unlike 1D LUTs, which can only control one value setting, 3D LUTs can allow you to control various value settings. As a result, 3D LUTs can give you more control over specific color values in your video.

Here’s how you can apply LUTs using Filmora:

### Step 1\.  Import the Footage

Launch Filmora and choose New Project. In the New Project window that opens, import the video you want to apply the LUT to by clicking on Import and selecting one of the drop-down options.

### Step 2\.  Add the Video to the Timeline

Drag and drop the video into your project’s timeline.

### Step 3\.  Open the Color Tab

Double click the video on the timeline to select it. Once it’s selected, go to the top left panel and click on the color tab.

### Step 4\. Apply a LUT to the Video

Under the color tab, navigate to the 3D LUT option and select one of the available options in the 3D LUT drop-down menu to apply a LUT.

Many LUTs are named after popular TV shows and series whose visual styles they mimic, such as Batman, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more.

Once you apply a LUT, you can see your changes in the Preview Window. Besides using the preset LUTs, Filmora also allows you to use custom LUTs. Instead of choosing one of the presets, click on the Load New LUT option to import your custom LUT into Filmora.

### Step 5\. Make Fine Adjustments

Once you apply a LUT, Filmora can allow you to make further modifications to the video. Click on the Advanced button at the bottom of the color tab to view advanced color correction options.

In the new window that opens, you can adjust several things, such as color, light, HSL, and more. You can also choose from a variety of other available presets.

### Step 6\. Save the Changes

Once you’re satisfied with the changes you’ve applied, click on the OK button in the lower right corner to save the changes.

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

## What Is VHS?

Since its introduction in 1976, VHS has been the most frequently used video cassette recording technology. The VHS format is a consumer-level analog video cassette recording standard for videotaping.

By 1980, VHS had captured 70% of the market and had established itself as the industry standard for entertainment and instruction.

Progressively, a new format was launched dubbed S-VHS (Super VHS), which featured improved video quality from 240 to 400 lines; however, people did not use it extensively.

VHS tape, compared to its competition at the time, Betamax tapes had longer tape lifespans. VHS tapes were preferred because they recorded three times as long as Betamax tapes because of their higher storage capacity.

The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.

## Part 3 FAQs of Creating Simple Slideshow Word

### 01What is the 10/20/30 rule of slideshow presentations?

The 10/20/30 rule sets counted limitations on slideshow elements to generate high quality presentation outputs. The rule states that the perfect slideshow presentation consists of a maximum of 10 slides, has a run time of approximately 20 minutes and has minimum font size of 30 points.

### 02What is the 6 x 6 bullet rule of slideshow presentations?

The 6 x 6 bullet point rule states that you should include a maximum of 6 bullet points within each slide, along with limiting the bullet description to 6 words at the most. Abiding by this rule, your presentations slides will never look cluttered, while you can convey the desired information in a precise manner.

### 03Why should the presentation slides have a limited amount of text?

Creating a crowded slideshow with a bundled text annotations are a downside to audience interests. Add only essential contents in text, while warding off unnecessary words, lest you may lose the uninterrupted attention of your viewers towards the presentation.

### 04What is the perfect screen time of each slide within a presentation?

Keeping a slide screen time between 2 to 3 minutes is a smart strategy to captivate viewer attention. To get an appreciable response from the audience, you should aim at coming directly at the point, instead of beating about the bush.

### 05What is the affordable word limit of each slide within a presentation?

To ensure a decent and professional look of your slideshow, restrict the latter’s text content to a maximum of 30 words within 6 to 8 lines.

## Part1 Basic Knowledge About Different Framing

Because framing is related to capturing or focusing an object by the camera lens, it can vary depending on your desired shot. Let's start with the full-shot first and understand how it works.

### 01 Full Shot (FS)

Remember the shot of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, where all the players are focused in one wide frame? This excerpt is a practical example of what a full shot looks like. Full-shot video framing is particularly common in action or thriller movies where the creator wants to generate suspense in the audience.

As the name indicates, a full shot often emphasizes the scenery as your subject fills the frame. Like the background isn't ignored or blurred out; instead, it isn't overly stressed as well. In most cases, the camera starts with a wide-angle shot and then eventually ends with focusing on the subject.

A full-camera shot greatly emphasizes the physical presence of the character. It tracks the subject's movements, gestures, or body language, making it the focal point. As a result, the shot obtained delivers a better understanding of actions and interactions among the character and its surroundings.

### 02 Medium Shot (MS)

We often see friends in movies, going to a casino, or playing cards at a bar. What do we observe in that shot? Hand movements, facial expressions, body language, and a little context of what is happening in the background. This shot is known as the medium shot and is often called the ¾ shot.

Using the medium shot video framing technique, the camera lens allows the viewers to see the background while still focusing on the main character. It's like you will know what is happening at the back but still remain close to the character's emotions and gestures.

A medium shot usually begins by showing the subject from the knees to his face. In other cases, the shot can also start from the character's waist to the top of their head. Compared to long shots, a medium shot takes you closer to the subject's emotions.

For example, in The Princess Diary, you can see how medium-shot video framing has been useful in portraying comedic scenes. You can see Mia reaching out for plates and glasses around the tables and her eyes squinting to concentrate on the process. The medium shot captures even the smallest emotions while focusing on the background.

### 03 Close-Up (CU)

When the subject's head and face take up most of the frame, framing videos is known as a close-up shot. And a particular example of this shot can be spotted in the airport scene in "Casablanca." This scene shows how the camera lens takes various shots before ending up on the actor's face, showcasing a number of emotions and intimacy.

A close-up shot is an eye-level shot, and as a result, it takes the subject to the forefront. As a result, this shot establishes a distinct sense of connection between the audience and the character. Additionally, the environmental distraction is kept minimal throughout this shot. This setup helps maintain the emotional impact that the shot will portray.

Some of the common emotions that would be captured using close-up video framing techniques include:

* Tear-filled gaze
* Furrowed brow
* Subtle smile

Cinematographers often use such shots to intensify climaxes. These shots can be viewed as a window to the characters' souls, allowing viewers to adapt the emotions on another level.

### 04 Extreme Close-Up (XCU)

To understand the extreme close-up video framing technique, let us illustrate the movie that remained our favorite action thriller while growing up: Minority Report (2002). In this movie, the shots briefly focus on the character's eyes before hopping into the future view. This extreme close shot serves as a crucial plot to develop thematic elements in the audience.

So, an extremely close shot focuses on specific details of a character. This can be either the subject's eyes, ears, or mouth. However, the shot is not often employed casually. Instead, it is used in a stance where it is appropriate and when there is a need to develop heightened emotion among the viewers.

You can see this shot as a magnifying glass that draws attention to even the smallest emotion that would have gone unnoticed otherwise.

## Part2 Master framing types

Don't know how to master framing types? No worries, we have a comprehensive guide on that! First of all, let's start with the most basic way to frame a video:

### 01 Establishing Shots

An establishing shot is usually used to develop a context for the next upcoming scene. It is often a movie's first scene and portrays an extremely wide shot of the context. This frame on the video indicates the location and time of the scene to the audience to engage with them on a deeper level.

One of the least-known things about an establishing shot is that it doesn't require a narrative to explain what is happening. Instead, it is shot alone, and the context is shot so that the audience gets to know everything as soon as they see the excerpt.

An amazing example of establishing a shot can be seen in Stanely Kubrick's horror film, The Shining. In the movie's opening scene, the camera goes through the forest and mountains before getting onto the mountaintop hotel where the action occurs.

### 02 Single Shot

A single shot frames a video that includes a single subject or character. It occurs when a character is talking or reacting to a scenario. Here, remember that if the lens shifts focus from a subject, it is not a single shot.

In the movie Extraction 2020, you can see a single shot being utilized when the character goes on to rescue his son from the kidnappers. The shot extends a long way, including through a car crash, weapon chasing, and that iconic Hemsworth sliding off a building into a brutal fight. And the incredible part was that all of this was captured in a single shot.

### 03 Two Shot/Group Shot

As the name indicates, a two-shot or a group shot is used to frame a video that involves more than one character. It could be two people conversing or friends sitting at a cafe gossiping. This shot is particularly helpful in portraying the relationship between the characters in the frame.

A good example of two-shot video framing can be seen in the movie Silverado. During the final shooting scene, you can see two cowboys standing far apart while facing each other. Here, the two-shot technique emphasizes tension before the cowboys draw their guns.

### 04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)

OTS, or Over-the-shoulder, is the most used shot in framing videos for making movies. To understand how this shot works, let us take an example of two subjects, one named A and the other named B. Now, A is sitting right in front of subject B. Here; the shot is executed by focusing on subject A from the shoulder of subject B. The basic purpose of the shot is to fill the conversation or the meeting between the subjects.

To understand this situation better, let's take an example from the movie How to Train Your Dragon. In the scene, Hiccup is seen having a conversation with his father. Here, when Hiccup is talking, the camera is focused on him over his father's shoulder. And when his father talks, the shot is taken over the shoulder of Hiccup.

### 05 Insert Shot

Insert short framing technique uses selective focus to draw the audience's attention to the subject. Whether it be an object or merely a piece of information, insert shot has always been effective in emphasizing details.

For example, in The X-Files, an insert shot is used to provide the audience with a look at the file of Scully. This insert shot reveals the most shocking revelations in the file, including a tissue sample. Additionally, the file insert shot also shows how shady Mulder is.

### 06 POV Shot

A POV shot is used to frame a video in a way that shows what a character is doing. You can take this as a shot showing the world from the character's perspective. Our modern-day games, including Call of Duty Black Ops, are a common example of such POV shots.

The movie Friday the 13th is an iconic example of a POV shot frame on video. If you remember, the movie revolved around a killer who wasn't identified until the end. So, the audience watched the film from the killer's perspective until he was recognized.

## Conclusion

To sum it up, mastering the art of video framing, from full shots to POV shots, is an exciting journey that helps you to weave exciting stories. Understanding these techniques will empower you to craft a compelling narrative to captivate your audience, whether you are a beginner or a professional.

So, begin with framing videos now and let your work speak volumes!

Easily convert images and GIFs to videos with music and stop scrolling with Kapwing's image-to-video tool. With kapwing, you can turn your photos into a dynamic slideshow for a presentation or an engaging video for social media and YouTube. Even with minimal editing experience, you can turn a single image into a professional video.

Kapwing supports turning a single image into a video, as well as joining multiple images one by one into a slideshow-style video. With an intuitive timeline and the ability to specify the duration of each image, you won't need to read a long tutorial to convert an image to a video with this easy online tool. Follow the steps below to convert your images to videos using kapwing.

##### Step1Upload your image or images

Upload an image or set of images directly to Kapwing. You can also embed a link to a .png or .jpg on the web. Once uploaded, your images will appear on the canvas as a collage.

##### Step2Select time and size

Select the image and find the duration dropdown in the right edit menu. Use the "**adjust duration**" dropdown to choose how long you want your output video to be. You can also resize the image to a different aspect ratio. Crop, add music, set the background color, and more with Kapwing's simple editor. If you have uploaded multiple images, arrange the photos in the correct order to make the presentation perfect.

##### Step3Export and share

Just click **Export** and your final video will be created. The output file is MP4\. Kapwing is completely free and requires no downloads. Enjoy the new video you created with your image or images.

## Part 3\. Other 3 ways to convert image to video online

Even though an online image-to-video maker is not as powerful as photo and video editing software products like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can still use this online image-to-video maker to create videos effortlessly. However, to save time, you should prepare all the material you want to use in your video in advance so that you can upload it to the platform of your choice and have your video ready in minutes. Let's take a look at the image-to-video maker that you can use to create captivating social media videos.

### 2\. [Image to video](https://imagetovideo.com/)

![image to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-3.jpg)

This website offers a lot of different tools that you can use to create videos from your photos, crop videos, or add 3D transitions between frames. Keep in mind that the maximum number of photos you can use in one video is limited to thirty. Once you get to the home page of this platform, just upload your photos and arrange them in any way you want.

You can also add text, music, or your company logo to the video, then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. You can preview the video after the platform has generated it and decide whether you want to download it or start over if you didn't like the result.

### 3\. Mp3Care

![mp3care](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-4.jpg)

This web application makes converting JPEG files to MP4 video files a simple two-step process that only requires uploading photos and then selecting the time between the two images. The maximum number of photos you can use in a video is limited to just twenty, with the maximum duration of each image in the video not exceeding the 20-second mark. Adding transitions between images is also on the list of options this platform provides, but Mp3 Care Photo to Video lacks any other video editing features. Despite some obvious drawbacks, this online photo-to-video maker is still a great choice if you want to convert your photos to videos quickly and for free.

First, download and install [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your Windows or Mac computer. In the following section, I will cover how to add photos to a video using Filmora on Windows. The procedure for adding photos to a video on Mac is similar.

##### Step1Import both photos and video files into Filmora

Double-click the files and they will be imported into the program. You can also directly drag and drop photo and video files into the video editing program. Then you need to set up the project such as aspect ratio and resolution.

##### Step2Add a photo to the video and apply some effects

After importing the files into the program, drag the video clip to the video editor timeline at the bottom of the screen. Then drag the photo to the track above the video. Click the "**Play**" icon to preview the video. Move the photo on the track to the point where you want to view it and drag the end to shorten or increase the duration of the photo.

![add a photo to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-6.jpg)

After that, edit your photo as you choose. Place the image anywhere you want, then drag its edge to change the size of the playing windows.

To access the picture, color, and motion panel, double-click the additional image on the track.

![edit photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-7.jpg)

Then click the "**Effects**" button for more mask and effect options. Go to the Utility option under Filters and then drag the image mask onto the photo on the timeline. Double click on the photo and then you can change the shape, height, width, and blending of the image mask. On the mask tab, you can shape the photo with a single click. You can also invert the mask to create a new shape. Choose one of the effects according to your wish to make your video more unique.

##### Step3Save the new video file

![save the new video file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-8.jpg)

After adding a photo to a video and making basic adjustments, you can export it in various ways by pressing the "**Export**" button. You can save it in different formats in the Format tab. If you want to play the video creation on iPod, iPhone, or iPad, click "**Device**" and select the device from the list.

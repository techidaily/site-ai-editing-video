## What Is Color Finale

The question of which is superior between Color Finale and DaVinci Resolve may have crossed your mind if you're considering upgrading your color grading software. That's very natural, too! These two programs for color grading and color correction are among the best options for intermediate to advanced video editors. And with good cause. But what distinguishes each piece of software?

Therefore, Color Finale is something you should definitely think about employing if you're currently using FCPX to edit your video. Color Finale 2, the most recent edition, is incredibly potent. Compared to the default Final Cut Pro coloring tools, it offers a significantly more detailed coloring experience. It's also shockingly simple to use. After installing it, Color Finale 2 will be accessible under "Video Effects." Simply drag and drop it onto the desired clips to use it. Alternately, make an adjustment layer and apply it to your entire video.

The use of curves, vectors, color wheels, and HSL curves will be available to editors. These can all be utilized in layers. Additionally, rearranging and modifying the layers is simple. The masking and an enhanced LUTs browser are two of Color Finale 2's finest additions. Masks are easy to handle and apply to video clips, and they have a great tracking capability. This makes it simpler for editors to isolate particular colors or sections inside film for intricate coloring.

Additionally, with Color Finale 1, the LUTs browser has been improved. LUTs are now much simpler to go through and preview. Additionally, Color Finale can be shown the location of your computer's favorite LUTs for rapid application. Alternately, you might make your own LUTs and store them for use in later projects. These resources offer a wide range of color options.

The nicest part about it all, though, is how easy Color Finale is to use. Numerous excellent Color Finale instructions may also be found on their YouTube channel. The base version of Color Finale 2 software costs $99 to buy. Alternately, spend $149 once to get the full feature set of Color Finale 2 Pro.

Additionally, editors more experienced with Premiere Pro will still find Color Finale to be simpler to use than DaVinci Resolve. This is due to the fact that DaVinci Resolve uses an entirely unique method than other tools for editing videos. With Resolve, there is a very high learning curve. But with Color Finale 2, you can get started after watching a few tutorials.

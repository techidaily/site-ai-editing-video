## 6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer

These days when you head on to social media, you can easily find 4-5 seconds video clips on the internet. However, many social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and other videos sharing platforms require you to make your video longer to meet the site’s minimum length requirements. So, for example, although Instagram’s minimum length is 3 seconds, you might want to find ways to engage your audience longer.

This article will describe the best ways to make a video longer. We’ll also offer a bonus tip on how you can edit your video to make it look better and attract more audience. On that note, let’s take a look.

**6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer**

There are many methods out there to make your video longer. This section will touch on the six best methods to make a video longer.

**Loop the Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-1.jpg)

One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.

Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.

**Slow Down the Video Speed**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg)

We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.

**Add an Intro and Outro**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg)

Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.

It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.

**Add Images to the Video**

This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.

**Boomerang Your Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg)

If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.

Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.

**Add More Content to Your Video Clip**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg)

Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.

Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.

## Want to Give a Bold and Colorful Look to Your Ad or Abstract Art Project? This Quick and Easy Tutorial Teaches How to Create a Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Risograph printing is a digital printing process that combines the best features of offset and screen printing used by many small print shops and design studios to provide trendy vibes and a classic look to the images.

If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you **create a risograph effect in Photoshop** quickly!

Without further delay, let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial!

## What Is Risograph Effect?

Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop [in the later part of this article](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.

Risograph was created in **1986** by a Japanese company called **Riso Kagaku Corporation.** It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.

The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph's unique charm and distinct look.

The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.

## How To Use Photoshop To Create Risograph Effect

The tutorial will be divided into three parts to help you master the risograph effect-creating skills to give your design project a distinct look.

Firstly, we will focus on how to use Photoshop in the following way to create the primary risograph effect.

### How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Step1 Launch [**Adobe Photoshop**](https://www.adobe.com/) on your laptop/desktop (For this tutorial, we are using Photoshop CC 2021). Click **“Create New,”** select the document size, and click **“Create.”** Now set a paper-like textured layer on the canvas. Click **“Ctrl + Shift + N,”** and in the new layer window, set the mode to **“Multiply.”** Click **“OK.”** to confirm your action.

![adding new layer to create risograph effect in photoshop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-new-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step2 Next, press **“Ctrl+Shift+E”** to combine your layers and select the **“Edit”** option from the top toolbar. Scroll down and select **“Define Pattern.”** Set the pattern name and click **“OK.”**

![select edit option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/defining-pattern-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Click **"Layer"** from the toolbar and choose **"New Fill Layer"> "Pattern."** Next, select your new pattern layer and click **"OK"** to get a grid layer.

![choose new fill layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-grid-pattern-to-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step3 Let's place an object/subject onto our canvas. Set the issue to "**Multiply**," right-click on it and choose "**Convert to Smart Object**."

![choose convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-main-object-to-smart-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step4 To add a Gradient Map Layer, click **“Layer,”** scroll down and click **“New Adjustment Layer.”** Select **“Gradient Map…”** from the drop-down menu and click **“OK”** to confirm.

![click layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/selecting-gradient-map-from-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Use the **“Properties”** panel and select the **“gradient”** colors. Here we’ve chosen shades of **“White”** and **“Red.”** Click **“OK”** to apply.

![select the gradient color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-gradient-map-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step5 For the image to have less contrast, click **“Image”** in the top toolbar and click **“Adjustments.”** Select **“Levels…”** from the menu. Now, set the black output to **73.**

![click image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-adjustment-level-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

### How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect

After creating an image with the risograph effect, how to make it more visually vertical? At this time, the dual-tone impact will help us have a more delicate picture.

The dual-tone effect is a technique in the risograph effect that combines two or more overlapping images to give a more vibrant look to the final project or emphasize the critical concept, information, or idea.

To create a dual-tone risograph effect in Photoshop, do the following steps.

Step1 To create a dual-tone risograph effect, add another subject to the canvas and set the blending mode to **Multiply.** Also, change its opacity to blend the two issues well. Make sure to turn the subject to **Smart Object** by right-clicking on the object's layer and selecting **"Convert to Smart Object."** Adjust the position of the subject on the previous one.

![add another subject to the canvas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-subject-to-smart-object-in-photoshop-to-create-risograph-effect.png)

Step2 Select the layer of the new subject and click **“Layer”** Click **“New Adjustment Layer”** and select **“Gradient Map…”** from the drop-down menu.

Open the Gradient Editor and set the gradient colors of the new subject. Click **“OK”** to confirm. Click **“Image”** and choose **“Adjustments”** from the drop-down menu. Select **“Levels”** and set the **Black Output** to **73.**

Step3 Click **“Filter”** and open **“Filter Gallery.”** Navigate to **“Swatches” > “Torn Edge”** and set the **Image Balance, Smoothness, and Contrast** to **30, 15, and 15,** respectively, if you want to smooth down the subject.

Finally, your dual-tone effect is created in Photoshop!

### How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes

In this part, let’s see how to use the layer modes to add another subject to the canvas and blend it with the previous ones.

Step1 Place the new subject on the canvas and set the layer mode to **Multiply** by pressing the **“Ctrl + Shift + N”** and selecting **“Multiply”** from the drop-down menu in the new pop-up window. Click **“Ok”** to apply your changes.

To adjust the size of the object, click **“Edit”** from the top toolbar, and select **“Transform.”** From the drop-down menu, select **“Scale.”** Use the handles to make the object smaller or larger.

Step2 Click the **“Move”** icon from the left menu and drag the object to set its position. Now, copy and clip the **Gradient mode** from the main subject to the new one.

Step3 Apply the **Level** and **Filter Galler** to the new object (Same settings as the main subject). That’s it. You’ve successfully blended images using the layer mode.

It provides the users with some special features like easy trimming, splitting and merging of clips, etc. By using Filmora, you can easily crop your short video (a clip) and also resize it.

## An easier way to crop video using Filmora

Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a software created for use on Windows, designed to edit videos. It has many of the features of Adobe Premiere, but it is free.

It supports the following formats: AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, MOV, FLV and 3GP.

Wondershare Filmora is different than most video editors in that it does not use timelines. Instead, the user edits clips in a storyboard and adds effects and titles to them. It also has an Audio Visualization feature that plays back music in your collection and shows what you're listening to in real time. There is no voice-over tool and it is not possible to add an audio track.

Wondershare Filmora has a very large number of effects, all editable via keyframes. These include simple motion graphics such as fades and dissolves, but it also includes advanced options like motion blur and chroma-key. There are free downloadable effects, which are created by users.

Wondershare Filmora supports text editing and there is a large library of free fonts available for download on its website. It does not support green-screening/chroma-keying. This can be done in post production via Adobe Premiere or other software.

It also has the ability to add a number of different titles, which can be stacked and moved around in 3D space.

Wondershare Filmora allows you to import photos for use in slideshows and effects. Every clip or image can have its own effect applied to it if desired.

After editing, the project is rendered in real time with no waiting. You can also choose to render only part of the video by selecting the time range.

One final bonus is Wondershare Filmora's media library, which allows users to add files from their computer and sort them by category. This makes finding your desired video a much easier task.

This software has a very simple interface that is easy to navigate, even for beginners. The design of the program makes it intuitive enough that you can start editing videos right away without having to go through tutorials. It is easy to create the desired effects and titles that you need for your video with just a few clicks. Its editing tools are powerful enough for professional use while still being easy to learn.

The one downside is that Wondershare Filmora does not support 4K resolution—the maximum output size is 1080p.

## How to Control the Speed of Video

Speed doesn't course at the same level for everyone. You can change momentum. You can slow it down and speed it up to convey a particular mood. In this article, you will learn how and when to control the speed of the video and its importance.

## Importance of Speeding up/Slowing Down Your video?

Speeding up or slowing it down, known as slow or fast motion, can make your video faster or slower than its actual speed, called speed ramping. Overall, adjusting the speed of video clips can enhance the video's visual effects, especially if you want to convey a particular mood to the audience. Speeding up your video may create a comical and dramatic impact, while slowing down your video can give viewers a time-lapse feel or an emotional mood.

This video speed controlling software can instantly speed up video up to 50x times. On the contrary, you can also slow down the video up to 0.1x, which means a one-minute video will run for 10 minutes.

How important is this Feature? The technique plays an essential role in adjusting the video's speed. You will appreciate this technique once you've started editing your video. At first, controlling the speed of your video without music will give you a plain or bare impression. Based on my experience, I cannot quickly identify which video part needs to control the speed. Still, once you've added music at the start, you can quickly determine when and where you should maintain the momentum based on the beat of the music.

## How to Speed up/Slow down a Video?

Nowadays, most video editing software offers an effortless way of giving special cinematic effects through speed ramping? Speed ramping is an approach to adjusting the clip's speed to send the message across and provide the audience with an element of confusion. Since speed ramp is a gradual increase in the acceleration or deceleration of a video clip, reasons to slow down or speed up video vary from merely decorative to practical, but whatever your reasons, speed effects can add some production value to your projects.

This article gives you a guide on how to slow down or speed up video on your video editing software, for example, using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on your device.

For instance, if you want to generate sales from your products, create a slideshow that shows the benefits of your products and compares them with others in the same category.

**●** **Keep it simple**

The real purpose of a slideshow presentation is to convey your data or message in a simple manner that can be easily related. Since the slides move one after the other in a slideshow, they should be created in a manner so that the viewer can quickly understand them.

**●** **Keep minimum text**

Though text can be included in a slideshow, keep them to a minimum. A slideshow is a creative presentation having pictures, videos, graphs, and several other elements. So, keep the text whenever necessary and don’t include too much-written content. Moreover, a viewer can relate to and recall the product, brand, or service more through a message rather than a text.

**●** **Include compelling visuals**

Include relevant visuals like videos and images into your slideshow. Make sure that the files are in high resolution and clear and support the theme or the message you are trying to convey through the presentation.

**●** **Add effects, filters, overlays, and other elements**

Instead of adding the raw image and video footage, edit and customize them to make them more interesting and engaging. There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.

**●** **Use Templates**

Templates are ready-made design that helps you create a slideshow presentation quickly and easily. The templates in a variety of designs in different categories are available for you to choose the most suitable one. You can check the collection of templates from various online sites and tools.

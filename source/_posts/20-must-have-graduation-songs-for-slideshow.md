The **freeze-frame video editing** effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.

The **freeze-frame video editing** effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set.

Once you have a general concept, it's time to develop it further. You can do it by creating rough sketches or storyboards. You can also film test footage to see how the concept will look on screen.

##### Step5Effort and attention to detail

Remember, this step is the foundation of your music video. So, take your time and don't rush through it. By putting in effort and attention to detail, you'll be able to create a visually stunning and closely tied to the song's music video.

## Choose a style for your music video

While creating ideas for the music video, it's also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:

![types of music video style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/types-of-music-video-style.jpg)

### 1.Performance-style music video

If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.

### 2.Narrative-style music video

A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.

You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.

Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.

![treatment of the plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/treatment-of-the-plan.jpg)

If the artist approves the direction of the video, it's time to move on to storyboarding!

## Storyboard your music video

Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding! It allows you to break down your music video visually and highlight key visual moments. It can save time and money and convey a clear idea to the team. You can do this on paper, a computer, or a tablet, whatever works best for you. Let's see how to do it with the help of [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

##### Step1Draw your ideas

You are supposed to break your video idea into different scenes. For each scene, you should draw a picture of what the shot will look like and draw them within the rectangles.

![drawing pictures of the scenes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/drawing-pictures-of-the-scenes.jpg)

![importing song and scene pictures to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/importing-song-and-scene-pictures-to-filmora.jpg)

##### Step4Drop your media onto the timeline

Drag and drop the song to the audio timeline. Then press shift, select all images, and drop them into the picture timeline. If you realize you are missing enough clips to complete the song, you can draw and add more shots.

![dropping song and pictures into the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dropping-song-and-pictures-into-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step5Adjust the frame

You can right-click on the picture's timeline and select **Crop to fit** to adjust the image on the screen. You can also adjust the scenes according to the song.

![selecting crop to fit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/selecting-crop-to-fit.jpg)

##### Step6Add effects

You can also simulate transitions and effects in the clips. Let's suppose you want to show a zoom-in shot. Then you would click on the picture frame and the keyframe option just above the timeline. Now keyframe the position and scale of the clip according to you.

![adding keyframe to the pictures](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-keyframe-to-the-pictures.gif)

Once you feel like your clips sync with the song, you are ready to start planning for the production of your music video.

## Conclusion

We hope this blog has given you a better understanding of how planning and storyboarding can help make your music videos better. You can ensure that your vision is clearly communicated to the audience by planning and storyboarding your music videos properly. Now that you know what to do, it's time to put that knowledge into action. Take a pencil and paper and start sketching the shots and scenes you want to create.

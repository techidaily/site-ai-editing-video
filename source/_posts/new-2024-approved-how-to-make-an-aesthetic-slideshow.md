## How to Make Video Slow Motion?

Slow-motion videos are in trend now, especially when shooting for [Instagram Reels](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), TikTok videos, or [YouTube Shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.

That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.

#### In this article

02 [How to Apply the Smooth Slow-Motion Effect in Post-Production?](#part2)

03 [When to Use Slow Motion?](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences**

Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between **120** FPS and **240** FPS as needed. Tap **1x** from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.

After adding a freeze point, optionally, you can drag and reposition it in the **Speed Ramping** timeline as needed. Finally, click **OK** from the bottom-right area to save the changes.

## Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

## Part 2 Best 5 Tip to Make a Slideshow with Music

While the visual elements count to be the major attractions of a slideshow presentation, subtle background music can work to bind the audience with the rhythm and flow of the presentation. Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:

### 01Select a Royalty Free Music Plan

Adding suitable background music can uplift the appeal of your slideshow presentation to greater extents. While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.

However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.

### 02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices

When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.

You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.

![Recommended Audio Choices](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-10.JPG)

### 03Synchronize the Slideshow Music and the Contents

The credibility of your background audio lies in adding additional spark and integrity to the stills and videos of the presentation. When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.

Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.

If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.

![Selecting the Appropriate Background Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-11.JPG)

### 04Curate and Test

However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation.

If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.

## What You Should Know About Speech-to-Text Technology

Speech-to-text technology (**STT**) improves communication, especially in a multi-language setting. One of the ways we practice multilingualism is via **speech-to-text technology:** speakers input a language, and viewers read another language. Other advantages include converting oral speech into a document, real-time compatibility, and offline usage. This article explains how you can utilize **speech-to-text assistance** technology for optimal productivity.

![speech to text technology](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology.jpg)

## Part 1: What is speech-to-text technology?

Speech-to-text technology (STT) identifies oral pronunciation and converts them into computer codes: electronic words. The computer electro-communication requires a medium of conversion: receiver and interpreter. Therefore, speech-to-text technology contains both the receiver and interpreter, which exist electronically. The medium or receiver can be software installed on a device; it must have a receiver and a screen. The computer serves a good purpose, although other devices can receive words without displaying them.

A speech-to-text technology does not necessarily have to contain displaying screen: a sound interpreter may replace the screen. Thus, speech-to-text can be oral words - electronic recognition - word encoding - display, or recitation. Oral wordings are the human's contribution to speech-to-text technology, although all communication (especially speech) may be generated from a computer. Inter-device communication is another advancement of speech-to-text technology. For example, combining one or more devices allow you to use speech-to-text assistance technology in different languages.

Communication is the paramount importance in speech-to-text technology. Still, some advantages include easy data conversion, documentation, workflow flexibility, and easy access to data. For example, documentation is incomplete if every human cannot access the file. All humans cannot read; improvising data into oral documents reduces the percentage of people who cannot access the file. Speech-to-text increases the channel for less privileged individuals. For instance, the deaf who cannot listen to a recorded file can read the file via speech-to-text technology.

Speech-to-text technology incorporates many advantages. Learning to use the technology is the first step in familiarizing and getting yourself equipped.

## Part 2: What are the stages for the technology?

STT gives so many stages and applications for a daily and smooth organization. Some include:

### 1\. Education

Education and the love to study other languages increase with speech-to-text technology. The educative application is not limited to four corners of the room; it extends to all daily learning activities. Communication is educative if you learn new things via communication.

STT improves all processes associated with less privileged education. For example, everyone easily pours their mind into a computer screen page when they speak, especially in the language they understand using STT. Time and submission date are important factors in the educational system; STT improves time, submission, accuracy, and authentication.

### 2\. Video Subtitles

Videography and filmmaking carry a large percentage of today's media. Data input and integration in the video-making process weigh a lot, and the concept of STT reduces the load on the data specialist. Instead of long hours of typing, oral communication is applicable. Processing time is a factor of productivity; STTs do not only affect the time of production but also maintain accuracy.

### 3\. Chatbots

Chatbots are available on websites. Users have different preferences: some can type while others like to communicate via speech. The chatbots attend to users' needs; you can do more with STT if installed on the website. STT promotes freedom of communication and increases user interaction on your website. STT may be incorporated into mobile applications too. There is more to STT, and the advantage is unlimited if you add it to your chatbots.

### 4\. Translation

Translation is the interconversion of languages. The main reason translation is important is because communication is essential; without communication, production will be static. STT is among the tool that elevates productivity via communication. For example, STT improves communication in a situation where more than one language combines as one.

## Part 3: What are the best STT Technology provider

### 1\. Amazon web services

STT is one of the services in the Amazon web services. The STT is available for all users who subscribe to one or more Amazon services. Some features include unlimited conversion, easy download, and availability in multiple formats. To get started, you need to sign up for a free AWS account and begin to enjoy the offer. Although the services are available for all users, limitations, and upgrades come a few times when you must pay for certain premium services.

![amazon web services](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology-3.jpg)

### 2\. Google docs voice typing

Google docs voice typing is available for all Google users. You can access the Google docs voice typing provided you are on a service by Google. The service is available on the Google docs application - one of the services created by Google. Google docs are free for download and available for desktop and mobile users.

### 3\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora STT is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms/stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.

**●** **Underlying Concept**

It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.

## Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate

As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:

**●** **Step 1: Select an Artwork**

Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.

If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.

![Procreate Animated GIF Creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-1.JPG)

**●** **Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool**

From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.

![Procreate- Animation Assist Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-2.JPG)

**●** **Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments**

At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.

While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.

**●** **Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.**

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

**Step 5: Almost There.**

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

## How to Create Chroma Key Written Text Effects in Filmora

Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.

## Part 1\. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?

Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.

![chroma key text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png)

Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it's an easy way to make 3D motion videos.

To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:

## Part 2\. Filming Tips for Written Texts

To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.

### Tip 1\. A Pen and a White Paper

We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.

We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:

![purple color pen on white paper](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png)

It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it's more apparent during filming.

### Tip 2\. Different Color Paper

There are many chances that you don't have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don't need to worry because you can use different color papers too.

But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.

![different color paper with different markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don't use dull color pens with bright color paper.

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

### Tip 4\. Larger Size of Letters

As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

![the larger size of the written key text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-5.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.

After filming all the clips, you must edit those shots on the Filmora to get the chroma effect. Scroll more to get the step-by-step process!

## Part 1: What is HDR photography?

First things first. Before using the HDR feature on your smartphone, let’s learn what actually is the function of HDR.

Standing for High Dynamic Range, HDR is an image capturing method where the dynamic range of an image is high. When we talk about dynamic range, it refers to the difference between the lightest and the darkest elements of a picture. Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.

While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.

Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.

## Part 2: How to tell if I can shoot HDR images on my Android devices or not?

HDR images can be captured using DSLR cameras, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the camera and the process of capturing the HDR images. A simpler alternative to this is using an Android device. The principle of capturing HDR images using an Android phone is simpler in comparison to a professional DSLR camera and also quick. Using an Android device, the imbalance in the exposure is corrected and the details of the image background, as well as the foreground, are enhanced.

**How-to steps to check the HDR camera Android feature**

So now that you know that HDR images can be easily captured using your Android device, the next important thing is to check if your phone supports the HDR feature or not as not all Android devices have the HDR mode. Below listed are some of the options where you can the HDR option in the camera app of your Android device.

* Check for the HDR option under the Shooting Mode menu (this can be found on high-end Samsung phones.)
* In the devices like HTC One X, Desire X, and others with custom Camera apps, the feature can be found under the Camera Scenes section.
* In case you cannot locate the HDR option in both the above methods then try looking for it under the Settings menu of Camera. Devices like Sony Xperia T and Xperia V have the option here.
* For the Nexus 4 device that runs on Android 4.2 OS, the option of HDR mode can be turned on by simply long-tapping the viewfinder and then tapping on the HDR icon.
* You may also find the option of HDR mode under the labels like Backlight HDR or Backlight Correction HDR. On the Samsung Galaxy devices, HDR is labeled as Rich Tone and can be located under the Smart Modes menu.

## Wondering How to Add Custom Transitions in OBS Studio? Here Are the Steps to Add Stinger Transitions to OBS. Get a Better OBS Alternative to Add Transitions

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

## Part 1: How to Film Clips for Cloning Effects?

To make cloning effects, you will need to take two different shots and use a tripod to place the camera, so the frame doesn't change.

**Shooting the first clip**

For the first shot, stay on one side of the frame and do the first action. For example, you can pretend to yank and take off your jacket. Then, drop the jacket to the other side of the frame.

![shooting the first clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-1.gif)

To make it more realistic, make an interaction by reacting to the "clone" while facing the other direction.

**Shooting the second clip**

Then, shoot for the second clip without changing the frame. You will have to go to the place where you dropped the jacket from the first shot.

![shooting the second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-3.gif)

Act as if you have just appeared there and give a reaction to the other side as well.

![bring the first clip to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg)

Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let's start working on the clone part using masking.

First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the "clone."

![place the second clip on a different window track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg)

On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show "the clone."

![adjust the position of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif)

Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.

Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn't match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11\. To use it, double-click the second clip and select **Speed > Speed Ramping > Customize**.

**Extra tip:** Add one more effect to make it more magical.

Step1 Open the **Effects** window and search for "up down 1."

![drag and drop the effect onto the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-12.jpg)

Then, drag and drop the effect again in the transition between the first and the second clip. Adjust it to the appropriate length, then it will give a more dramatic effect.

Step3 You can playback and see how it looks on the preview screen.

## How To Make an Impressive Warzone Thumbnail for Free

We have clarified how important a Warzone thumbnail that pop is. But how to make one? That's what this article is for. Here, you will learn how to create impressive Warzone thumbnails for free. That's right - FOR FREE.

Without further ado, here are the steps that you should follow:

##### Step1 Download & Install an Excellent Warzone Thumbnail Maker

Of course, the first step is to find good software for making thumbnails. But there is no thumbnail maker specifically made for Warzone. So, the best choice is a thumbnail maker that is also a video editor - like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Admittedly, Wondershare Filmora has premium plans. But you can download it for free. Additionally, you can use the free trial version to create video thumbnails without upgrading to the paid version. So essentially, Wondershare Filmora is a free Warzone thumbnail maker. The best part is that you can use some of Filmora's other features to make the thumbnail as cool as possible.

##### Step2 Take a Snapshot of Your Call of Duty Warzone Game

Using in-game screenshots is recommended. That way, the image is personalized and can't be found anywhere else. Unfortunately, COD: Warzone does not have an in-game functionality for screenshots. So, you have to get the image using other means. You can use the following keyboard shortcuts to grab a screenshot:

* **Using Windows' Game Bar -** Windows key + ALT + PrintScreen
* **NVIDIA's Shadow Play -** ALT + Z
* **Windows Screenshot -** Windows + PrintScreen

##### Step3 Create a Project, Set Project Ratio & Import the Snapshot

## How to Add Echo Effect to Video

If you are alone in a large empty room and you speak something, your words get echoed across the room. It will seem as if you are speaking the same words multiple times but with less volume every single time. When you have a video where you are reading out poems or giving an important message, adding an echo effect to the video makes the audio impactful and engaging.

You will need a video editor where you can add echo effect to video in simple steps. Not many video editors are available where you can add the echo effect instantly from the available sound effects and presets. That is why we have handpicked the best video editors for Windows PC and Mac users. You can also add echo effect to video online from any device directly from your web browser.

## Part 1\. How to Add Echo Effect to Video Online

If you want to add echo effect to your video one time only, there is no need to download any video editor uselessly. You can use an online audio editor to add echo effect and combine the modified audio and video files together. TwistedWave is one of the few online video editors that allow you to add echo effect to your video. Here are the steps how to add echo effect in video online.

Step 1Open your web browser and visit “twistedwave.com/online”. Click on Upload a file button to upload your video file.

## Conclusion

This was our two cents on how you can speed up a video on Canva. In the end, speeding up a video is a great way to keep your audience engaged in video production. It lets you make your content short and precise or introduce dramatic effects. If you want to use such features in your videos, then Filmora is a great way to start. Not only do you get fast video effects, but you can also save them without any internet access. So, give it a try and see the difference yourself!

3) After finishing, click "**Ok**" and preview your clip to see the fast video effect in-placed.

##### BONUS STEPEnable the Speed Ramping Effects

Speed ramp is a unique feature in Filmora which allows you to apply acceleration or deceleration at any point in your clip, creating unique effects. To use these settings, you need to:

1) Select your timeline video and choose the "**Speed**" button on the bottom bar. After that, click on "**Speed Ramping**."

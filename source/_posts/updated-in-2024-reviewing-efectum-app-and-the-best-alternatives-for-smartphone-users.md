![a preview of the alternate reality effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-1.gif)

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

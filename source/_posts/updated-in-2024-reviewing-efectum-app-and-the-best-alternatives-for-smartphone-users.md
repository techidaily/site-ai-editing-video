## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video clip from which you want to extract the audio. Select the option of “Detach Audio” from the menu. Instantly, an audio file is visible on the screen, and it is the original one from the source.

**Step 3:** Now, the audio track gets separated from the video successfully. Wondershare Filmora also offers to add one more audio file. Yes, it is also possible with this software.

**Step 4:** After separating the audio from the video, it is simple to delete the track, whether it is audio or video that is not in use or want to use. Click on the “Export” option for saving your required audio tracks, or you can even select the “iPod” for playing the audio. You can also save the audio file separately as the new file on your hard drive. After exporting the audio tracks, load the project file again that has the frames for the video and later export the video file.

Whenever you think about the compatibility of editing software with different operating systems, Wondershare Filmora comes to mind as the first choice. All the new features of Wondershare Filmora in its latest version have received positive feedback and reviews. Definitely, it is the actual replacement of the previously used editors such as video editor in Windows or iMovie in Mac.

Wondershare Filmora not only adds the animation but as well offers customization. Adding the keyframes is very easy for the user to change the positions, scale or rotate the clips. The feature of colour matching is also available so you can match the clips from one frame to another. Even the shortcut keys are available for all the commands that bring effective and efficient editing tasks.

Just little guidance and assistance can help you use the Wondershare Filmora as the options are suitable in front of your screen. No more waiting and thinking; start using this most straightforward editor and enjoy all the features of Wondershare Filmora.

Server boosts are one of Discord's main revenue streams, and they function similarly to Nitro. There are, nevertheless, significant distinctions. Server boosts are benefits tied to a particular server and used by any member.

A server must acquire two boosts to unlock level 1 boosts, seven boosts to reach level 2 perks and fourteen boosts for level 3.

With all of this in mind, can you say, **Discord server boosts** are worthwhile? They most certainly are. The added features can improve everyone's server experience and are inexpensive, significantly if boosting as a group.

Whether or not server boosting is worthwhile is mainly subjective. If you're not an active server member and only use Discord to play games with a small group of pals, you might want to save your money. if you're a member of a clan or online community dedicated to a server, boosting can be a terrific way to contribute to 'the greater good.' Aside from the cosmetic bonuses that come with each level, the better audio quality, streaming quality, and upload limit are valuable features.

If you plan to buy two or more **server boosts,** we offer Discord Nitro, which includes two server enhancements for the same price as buying them separately, plus a 30% discount on any additional server boosts purchased.

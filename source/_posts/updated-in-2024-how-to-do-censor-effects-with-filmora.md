There are many aspects to consider when it comes to publishing a video. Safety and privacy aspects are some of them. If you're looking to blur out a bystander or cut out profanities from your video with Filmora, this is the right article for you.

## Part 1\. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora

Filmora's powerful video editing menu includes easy tweaking on audio. You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.

## Part 2\. How to add mosaic to video with Filmora

Whether you want to hide a passerby's face or your own, or even other types of objects, Wondershare Filmora is ready to take on the task.

## Using Montage In Movies | Learn to Use Montage With Movies

As with many new things in life, Montage isn't your best friend right off the bat. So, if you want to learn to use montages with movies, they need to be the right ones. If you don't know what Montage is, it is a way of compressing an action or series of actions into a short amount of time. We look at movies because they are a common type of entertainment everyone has seen before, which makes them easier to understand as a concept.

Using Montage is a great way to create engaging video content. There are many people interested in the topic of Montage, so if you get that video out there, you can easily find an audience. When used in conjunction with YouTube advertising, creating videos about Montage could be an excellent business idea for you.

Learning how to use Montage properly can be challenging. The process isn't intuitive, and using it can feel like hiding random pieces around your page. But, when you watch the right movies, they can help you understand how to use this tool effectively. So, take some time, check out these movies, and learn how to get the most out of Montage!

## What Is A Montage?

The definition of a montage is a "series of short scenes or episodes forming a unified whole." That definition can lead to different interpretations of a montage and can be applied to any art medium. A "montage" isn't just for movies. Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.

If you've seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you've probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.

## Purpose of Montage

Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project. Even though these types of movies have become a common genre, there's a list of reasons why this is popular in movies today.

* Montage has several uses in movies. Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm. These different uses of Montage do come with their styles, but they all share a few common traits.
* They're often used to condense periods of storytime into much smaller but more entertaining segments. The word montage is French for "to construct from many parts ."Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.
* This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them. A great example of a montage was used in Rocky when Rocky was training for his fight with Apollo Creed.
* A montage allows filmmakers to explore a theme using several sequential shots that can't be covered in a single shot.

## Learn To Use Montage With These Movies

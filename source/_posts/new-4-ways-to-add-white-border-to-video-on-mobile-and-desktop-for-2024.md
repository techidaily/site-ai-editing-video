## Part1 Basic Knowledge About Different Framing

Because framing is related to capturing or focusing an object by the camera lens, it can vary depending on your desired shot. Let's start with the full-shot first and understand how it works.

### 01 Full Shot (FS)

Remember the shot of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, where all the players are focused in one wide frame? This excerpt is a practical example of what a full shot looks like. Full-shot video framing is particularly common in action or thriller movies where the creator wants to generate suspense in the audience.

As the name indicates, a full shot often emphasizes the scenery as your subject fills the frame. Like the background isn't ignored or blurred out; instead, it isn't overly stressed as well. In most cases, the camera starts with a wide-angle shot and then eventually ends with focusing on the subject.

A full-camera shot greatly emphasizes the physical presence of the character. It tracks the subject's movements, gestures, or body language, making it the focal point. As a result, the shot obtained delivers a better understanding of actions and interactions among the character and its surroundings.

### 02 Medium Shot (MS)

We often see friends in movies, going to a casino, or playing cards at a bar. What do we observe in that shot? Hand movements, facial expressions, body language, and a little context of what is happening in the background. This shot is known as the medium shot and is often called the ¾ shot.

Using the medium shot video framing technique, the camera lens allows the viewers to see the background while still focusing on the main character. It's like you will know what is happening at the back but still remain close to the character's emotions and gestures.

A medium shot usually begins by showing the subject from the knees to his face. In other cases, the shot can also start from the character's waist to the top of their head. Compared to long shots, a medium shot takes you closer to the subject's emotions.

For example, in The Princess Diary, you can see how medium-shot video framing has been useful in portraying comedic scenes. You can see Mia reaching out for plates and glasses around the tables and her eyes squinting to concentrate on the process. The medium shot captures even the smallest emotions while focusing on the background.

### 03 Close-Up (CU)

When the subject's head and face take up most of the frame, framing videos is known as a close-up shot. And a particular example of this shot can be spotted in the airport scene in "Casablanca." This scene shows how the camera lens takes various shots before ending up on the actor's face, showcasing a number of emotions and intimacy.

A close-up shot is an eye-level shot, and as a result, it takes the subject to the forefront. As a result, this shot establishes a distinct sense of connection between the audience and the character. Additionally, the environmental distraction is kept minimal throughout this shot. This setup helps maintain the emotional impact that the shot will portray.

Some of the common emotions that would be captured using close-up video framing techniques include:

* Tear-filled gaze
* Furrowed brow
* Subtle smile

Cinematographers often use such shots to intensify climaxes. These shots can be viewed as a window to the characters' souls, allowing viewers to adapt the emotions on another level.

### 04 Extreme Close-Up (XCU)

To understand the extreme close-up video framing technique, let us illustrate the movie that remained our favorite action thriller while growing up: Minority Report (2002). In this movie, the shots briefly focus on the character's eyes before hopping into the future view. This extreme close shot serves as a crucial plot to develop thematic elements in the audience.

So, an extremely close shot focuses on specific details of a character. This can be either the subject's eyes, ears, or mouth. However, the shot is not often employed casually. Instead, it is used in a stance where it is appropriate and when there is a need to develop heightened emotion among the viewers.

You can see this shot as a magnifying glass that draws attention to even the smallest emotion that would have gone unnoticed otherwise.

## Part2 Master framing types

Don't know how to master framing types? No worries, we have a comprehensive guide on that! First of all, let's start with the most basic way to frame a video:

### 01 Establishing Shots

An establishing shot is usually used to develop a context for the next upcoming scene. It is often a movie's first scene and portrays an extremely wide shot of the context. This frame on the video indicates the location and time of the scene to the audience to engage with them on a deeper level.

One of the least-known things about an establishing shot is that it doesn't require a narrative to explain what is happening. Instead, it is shot alone, and the context is shot so that the audience gets to know everything as soon as they see the excerpt.

An amazing example of establishing a shot can be seen in Stanely Kubrick's horror film, The Shining. In the movie's opening scene, the camera goes through the forest and mountains before getting onto the mountaintop hotel where the action occurs.

### 02 Single Shot

A single shot frames a video that includes a single subject or character. It occurs when a character is talking or reacting to a scenario. Here, remember that if the lens shifts focus from a subject, it is not a single shot.

In the movie Extraction 2020, you can see a single shot being utilized when the character goes on to rescue his son from the kidnappers. The shot extends a long way, including through a car crash, weapon chasing, and that iconic Hemsworth sliding off a building into a brutal fight. And the incredible part was that all of this was captured in a single shot.

### 03 Two Shot/Group Shot

As the name indicates, a two-shot or a group shot is used to frame a video that involves more than one character. It could be two people conversing or friends sitting at a cafe gossiping. This shot is particularly helpful in portraying the relationship between the characters in the frame.

A good example of two-shot video framing can be seen in the movie Silverado. During the final shooting scene, you can see two cowboys standing far apart while facing each other. Here, the two-shot technique emphasizes tension before the cowboys draw their guns.

### 04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)

OTS, or Over-the-shoulder, is the most used shot in framing videos for making movies. To understand how this shot works, let us take an example of two subjects, one named A and the other named B. Now, A is sitting right in front of subject B. Here; the shot is executed by focusing on subject A from the shoulder of subject B. The basic purpose of the shot is to fill the conversation or the meeting between the subjects.

To understand this situation better, let's take an example from the movie How to Train Your Dragon. In the scene, Hiccup is seen having a conversation with his father. Here, when Hiccup is talking, the camera is focused on him over his father's shoulder. And when his father talks, the shot is taken over the shoulder of Hiccup.

### 05 Insert Shot

Insert short framing technique uses selective focus to draw the audience's attention to the subject. Whether it be an object or merely a piece of information, insert shot has always been effective in emphasizing details.

For example, in The X-Files, an insert shot is used to provide the audience with a look at the file of Scully. This insert shot reveals the most shocking revelations in the file, including a tissue sample. Additionally, the file insert shot also shows how shady Mulder is.

### 06 POV Shot

A POV shot is used to frame a video in a way that shows what a character is doing. You can take this as a shot showing the world from the character's perspective. Our modern-day games, including Call of Duty Black Ops, are a common example of such POV shots.

The movie Friday the 13th is an iconic example of a POV shot frame on video. If you remember, the movie revolved around a killer who wasn't identified until the end. So, the audience watched the film from the killer's perspective until he was recognized.

## Conclusion

To sum it up, mastering the art of video framing, from full shots to POV shots, is an exciting journey that helps you to weave exciting stories. Understanding these techniques will empower you to craft a compelling narrative to captivate your audience, whether you are a beginner or a professional.

So, begin with framing videos now and let your work speak volumes!

03 [Role of AI in a Video Interview](#Part 3)

04 [Role of AI in Video Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How AI is being used in a job interview.**

In most cases, **an AI video interview** is the initial stage in the hiring process, in place of or in addition to a typical cover letter and CV. It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

### 01**Prepare for the interview differently.**

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

When in an **AI interview**, you need to prepare differently. It's not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

Remember that you're having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

Most **artificial intelligence video interviews** take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it's essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

There won't be a human at the other end of the camera, so there's no need to dress up, right? That's wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.

Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.

### 05**Practice before the interview.**

![Practice Before the Interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-5.jpeg)

To ace an **AI interview**, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an **AI interview**. To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye
        Contact and Neutral Voice Tone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-8.jpeg)

During an **AI video interview**, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don't have to strain to see into it. Avoid looking away all of the time; this can give the impression of being distracted and unfocused. Speak neutrally or brightly. Remember that the AI analyzes your speech tone and mannerisms. As a result, speaking in clear tones can help you succeed.

### 09**Maintain proper body posture and even talking speed**

![Maintain Proper Body Posture and talk speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-9.jpg)

Ensure to carry yourself the same way as you would in an in-person human interview because a human interviewer will watch your interview at some point. You emphasize more confidence when you sit up straight, Sit with an open posture, avoid crossed arms or legs, keep your chin towards your stomach, and do not hunch your shoulders or recline on the chair. Appear in control, natural, and ready to handle any question. Try to keep your talking speed at a conversational rate, and avoid talking too fast or too slow because it might come off as you being nervous or unsure of yourself.

### 10**Make use of keywords**

![Make Use of Keywords](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-10.jpg)

The use of keywords is essential in any job application process. Meanwhile, AI algorithms pick out keywords in a candidate's response during an interview. Stand out during an **AI interview** by using phrases that explain what you can contribute, echoing the exact language of the job posting. Before the **AI-based video interview**, carefully go through the job description and note what keywords the company uses to describe the role on the company website or job posting page. Be sure to use their words specifically.

## Part 3 **Role of AI in a video interview**

![AI in Job interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-11.jpg)

AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates' responses. Many significant companies use **AI video interviews** or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant's performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company's ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate's speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.

## Part 4 **Role of AI in video making**

In video production, artificial intelligence has proven faster and more efficient than humans. It's also more cost-effective and time-saving than hiring a video editor. It allows you to edit more films in a shorter amount of time. It streamlines your job by taking care of most of the burden, making video editing simple even for beginners. AI makes suggestions that the user may not consider, making video production more accessible and engaging. Automating color correction and scene recognition in films improves the visual experience and aids in the formulation of personalized messaging.

Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

### 01**Prepare for the interview differently.**

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

When in an **AI interview**, you need to prepare differently. It's not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

Remember that you're having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

Most **artificial intelligence video interviews** take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it's essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

There won't be a human at the other end of the camera, so there's no need to dress up, right? That's wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.

Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.

### 05**Practice before the interview.**

![Practice Before the Interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-5.jpeg)

To ace an **AI interview**, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an **AI interview**. To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye
        Contact and Neutral Voice Tone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-8.jpeg)

During an **AI video interview**, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don't have to strain to see into it. Avoid looking away all of the time; this can give the impression of being distracted and unfocused. Speak neutrally or brightly. Remember that the AI analyzes your speech tone and mannerisms. As a result, speaking in clear tones can help you succeed.

### 09**Maintain proper body posture and even talking speed**

![Maintain Proper Body Posture and talk speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-9.jpg)

Ensure to carry yourself the same way as you would in an in-person human interview because a human interviewer will watch your interview at some point. You emphasize more confidence when you sit up straight, Sit with an open posture, avoid crossed arms or legs, keep your chin towards your stomach, and do not hunch your shoulders or recline on the chair. Appear in control, natural, and ready to handle any question. Try to keep your talking speed at a conversational rate, and avoid talking too fast or too slow because it might come off as you being nervous or unsure of yourself.

### 10**Make use of keywords**

![Make Use of Keywords](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-10.jpg)

The use of keywords is essential in any job application process. Meanwhile, AI algorithms pick out keywords in a candidate's response during an interview. Stand out during an **AI interview** by using phrases that explain what you can contribute, echoing the exact language of the job posting. Before the **AI-based video interview**, carefully go through the job description and note what keywords the company uses to describe the role on the company website or job posting page. Be sure to use their words specifically.

## Part 3 **Role of AI in a video interview**

![AI in Job interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-11.jpg)

AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates' responses. Many significant companies use **AI video interviews** or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant's performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company's ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate's speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.

## Part 4 **Role of AI in video making**

In video production, artificial intelligence has proven faster and more efficient than humans. It's also more cost-effective and time-saving than hiring a video editor. It allows you to edit more films in a shorter amount of time. It streamlines your job by taking care of most of the burden, making video editing simple even for beginners. AI makes suggestions that the user may not consider, making video production more accessible and engaging. Automating color correction and scene recognition in films improves the visual experience and aids in the formulation of personalized messaging.

**Match The Video With The Audio Markers**

To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:

After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.

##### Step7 Scale and Blur The Background

Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.

If you leave the picture/photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.

![photo with black borders](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png)

To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:

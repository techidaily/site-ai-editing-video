Step6Use the Orbit Tool to rotate the text to get the true 3D effect visible on the screen.

![rotate text with orbit tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/rotate-text-with-orbit-tool.jpg)

Step7You need to get the lighting and shading for your 3D text. Right-click on Comp window and go to New> Light. Adjust the parameters from Light Settings window.

![adjust light after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adjust-light-after-effects.jpg)

Step8You can adjust Transform and Light Options from Comp window under Light layer for better effect.

![add transform after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-transform-after-effects.jpg)

You have successfully created 3D text effect on After Effects. You will now illustrate how to animate the 3D text.

## Part 2\. Create 3D Camera Animation

You have prepared your text with 3D effect, and you can have multiple 3D texts on your video. It is time to animate those 3D texts so that the 3D effect becomes more prominent and the text instantly grabs attention. You do not have to create animation from scratch as there are 3D animation presets available. All you need to do is apply them to your 3D texts and they will start to animate automatically. Besides, you can create 3D camera animation to show the texts from different camera perspectives. Here are the steps to use 3d animated text generator on After Effects.

Step1Once you have created your 3D text effect, go to Effects & Presets panel.

Step2Go to Text> 3D Text and you will see all the different 3D animation presets that you can apply.

![preview 3d text animation presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/preview-3d-text-animation-presets.jpg)

Step3Drag and drop your desired 3D animation directly to 3D text layer.

Step4If you want camera animation on your 3D text, select the Camera layer you already created. Press C to get the Orbit tool to get the starting position of the 3D text. You can also use Dolly tool and Pan & Zoom tool for adjustment.

![get start position 3d text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-start-position-3d-text.jpg)

Step5Now add a keyframe on Position option from Transform option to mark the starting point of the animation. Similarly, add another keyframe where you want the animation to end.

![add keyframe position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-keyframe-position.jpg)

Step6Use the Orbit tool, Dolly tool and others to position 3D text as per how you want the animation to end.

## Part 3\. Make Stunning 3D Text Effects Online

Since adding 3D effects to text is a rather heavy task in video editing, there are many who think that you cannot add 3D text effects without a dedicated video editor application. But there are many renowned online video editors available where you can create amazing 3D text effects and animations with a few clicks.

In fact, you can use 3d animated text generator online to get any desired text in 3D mode. We recommend FlexClip full-featured video editor for 3D text animation online. You can select from available 3D text templates and apply different motion animations. Here are the steps to follow.

Step1Open your web browser and “flexclip.com/editor/app”. Go to Media tab and import your video and add it to the Timeline.

![import video to flexclip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/import-video-to-flexclip.jpg)

Step2Go to Text and click on See All for Text Styles. Scroll down and check out the 3D text templates available. Click on any desired template to apply to your video.

## Part 4\. Alternative Way to Create 3D Text Animation

When you use an online video editor to create 3D text animation, there will have limited 3D text effects. We can use After Effects to create 3D text animations from scratch.

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a premium video editor that is equally popular among amateurs and professionals.

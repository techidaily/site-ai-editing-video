## How to Make a Video with Windows Movie Maker

Here are the steps you need to take to **make movies on windows 10**:

##### Step1 Import Media Into Movie Maker

![import media into windows movie maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/import-media-into-windows-movie-maker.jpg)

The first thing you need to do is get all of your video footage and images into Windows Movie Maker.

Media file formats can be imported into this program:

* **Audio Files**: aif, .aifc, .aiff, .asf, .au, .mp2, .mp3, .mpa, .snd, .wav, and .wma
* **Image Files**: .bmp, .dib, .emf, .gif, .jfif, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff, and .wmf
* **Movie Files**: asf, .avi, dvr-ms, .m1v, .mp2, .mp2v, .mpe, .mpeg, .mpg, .mpv2, .wm, and .wmv

To import media:

* Click "File" > "Import into collections."
* Browse to the location of the file you want to import, select it, and then click "Open."

Your selected file will now appear in the "Collections" pane. You can double-click on the imported file to preview it. If you're happy with what you see, great! You can now move on to step two. If the files are not good, no worries - you can always delete them and try again. Just right-click on the file and select "Delete," or press the "Delete" key on your keyboard.

##### Step2 Basic Editing from Timeline

![windows movie maker timeline edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/windows-movie-maker-timeline-edit.jpg)

After you have imported all of your desired clips and images into Windows Movie Maker, it is time to start editing them into your movie. Here are the things that you need to do to edit your clips and images:

* For cutting the image, you need to select the part of the image that you want to cut. To do this, just click on the image and drag it to where you want it to be cut. The cutting process will automatically happen when you release your mouse button.
* To combine the images, you need to select the images that you want to combine. To do this, click on one image and then hold down the "Ctrl" key while clicking on the other images that you want to combine. Once you have selected all the images you want to combine, just right-click on any of the selected images and choose "Combine Clips."
* To split clips in the timeline, select the clip you want to split by clicking on it. Then, position your mouse cursor to where you want to split the clip and click on the "Split Clip" button. The clip will be automatically split into two separate clips.

By doing these minor things, you can edit your clips and images in the timeline according to your preference. Now, you are one step closer to creating your very own movie!

##### Step3 Add Video Effects

![add effects windows movie maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/add-effects-windows-movie-maker.jpg)

Video effects are a great way to make your movies look more professional. Windows Movie Maker has various built-in effects that you can use to improve the quality of your videos. These effects can be applied to your movie's video and audio tracks. Moreover, they can add transitions between clips and even change the way your video looks.

There are hundreds of different effects that you can use in Windows Movie Maker. So experiment with them until you find a style that suits your needs. With a bit of practice, you'll be making movies that look like they were made by a professional in no time!

To add video effects in the **video movie maker windows:**

* Select the clip you want to modify, and then click on the "Effects" tab. From there, you can browse through the available effects and preview them before adding them to your project.
* Once you've found an effect you like, simply drag and drop it onto the clip.
* You can also add multiple effects to a single clip if you want.
* Just remember that too many effects can make your video look cluttered and difficult to watch. So be sure to use them sparingly.

When you're happy with your added effects, click on the "Ok" button to save your changes.

##### Step4 Edit Audio & Titles

## Part 3\. How to trim YouTube videos on a desktop?

Using an online video trimmer has been one of the last options that anyone would consider, but due to the expensive software, they have turned out to be a friendly and easy approach to editing videos. But the online video trimmers still rank at the bottom of the list because they're unstable, and you can't save the project at any time. If the online program breaks down, all your effort will be wasted. But desktop programs such as Filmora will never make you encounter such problems unless you experience a technical glitch.

With the help of a variety of strong editing tools and [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), users may quickly and easily make outstanding videos.

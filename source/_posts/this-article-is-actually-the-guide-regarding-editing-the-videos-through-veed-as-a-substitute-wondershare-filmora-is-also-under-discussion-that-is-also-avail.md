Typically, this occurs because a motion blur effect was not used while editing. Learning the ins, outs, rights, and wrongs of Motion Blur in After Effects is one of the most thrilling early steps in the motion graphics adventure. Learning how and when to utilize it successfully is a true "level up" moment for most designers.

Making everything you add to a motion graphic or animation project appear like it belongs there organically and hasn't been "artificially" inserted is a crucial component. Adding motion blur After Effects Is a fantastic tool for making items mix more naturally in your compositions. Let's quickly examine Motion Blur with all of this in mind. To help you better grasp motion blur and how to add motion blur to flawlessly merge objects in your video projects or even create styled effects, we've put up a detailed guide here.

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 2\. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects

In videos, slow-motion may be used in a variety of ways, such as to convey the emotional context of a story or make beautiful slideshow backdrops. It doesn't matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects' slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.

Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You'll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:

**Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:**

So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur's magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.

Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn't already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose "New Project" to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.

![install adobe after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-adobe-after-effects.jpg)

Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose "Effects & Presets." A search bar will appear as a result. Enter "CC Force Motion Blur" in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.

![preview effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

Step3 Next, drag the "CC Force Motion Blur" to the layers that represent your imported video at the bottom left of the screen. On the left side of the screen, under "CC Force Motion Blur," you will find settings for motion blur. Here, you may change the motion blur to suit your needs. You may type in the values and watch the video as appropriate. There are several choices available for you to modify.

**Note:** Before applying any speed effects, first trim your film to the proper length. Once the speed effects have been included, you need also make sure that your composition is lengthy enough for your clip. Once you're satisfied with the footage you want to slow down, choose one of the ways—Time warp or Time Stretch.

Step4 Customize "Shutter Angle" and "Motion Blur Samples." Always be careful to preview the video after any modifications. Adjust to your needs and specifications. Additionally, if you wish, you may add any additional effect to the video. When finished, save the video by selecting "File" in the upper left corner.

* Widescreen (16:9) – Recommended for Youtube and Facebook
* Instagram (1:1) – Recommended for Instagram and Facebook
* Portrait (9:16) – Recommended for Tiktok, Stories and Reels
* Standard (4:3) – Recommended for Facebook, LinkedInn and other

Being aware of the right ratio for each social media platform will help you to advertise correctly. It also affects how you edit your video. For example, if you choose a different aspect ratio than what was originally recorded by Filmora's camera tools, then some of your content may be cut off or stretched out in undesirable ways when viewed on certain devices (e.g., smartphones).

## Split Testimonial Video into Small Clips

![split testimonial video into small clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/split-testimonial-video-filmora.jpg)

When you're ready, drag your video testimonials to the Show Track then begin to use the “split” button to cut out parts of the video.

To split a video into smaller sections, start by cutting it down to the appropriate length by moving the playhead to the beginning position of the part you want to cut, clicking the Split icon (the scissors icon) on the toolbar, or clicking the Split button on the playhead.

From there, repeat this procedure until you've completed the whole narrative. You'll be left with numerous cut segments that you may either delete or rearrange. To remove a clip from your movie, choose Delete from the toolbar or right-click and select delete.

## Add Catchy Headlines and Text (Optional)

If desired, add catchy headlines/texts like "How to Eliminate Chronic Pain Forever”. You can do this by clicking Text button from toolbar located across top portion of screen (beside Transitions button).

![add catchy headlines and text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Adding a phrase or a short sentence is called “headline”. It would be nice to add one of them at your video, so that viewers can get an idea about what it's about before watching it in full. The text can be customized by using different font styles like bold, italic, underline etc., as well as its size and color.

## Input Subtitle

Subtitles are used to translate the spoken word into text. If you have a video that is in a language other than English, subtitles can be added so that viewers who do not speak the language can still understand what is being said. Subtitles are also useful if you want to add subtitles for educational purposes, such as teaching students how to pronounce certain words and phrases.

![input subtitle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/input-subtitle-filmora.jpg)

Make sure to use a non-copyright music so that you don't run into any copyright problems when you post your video. There are several no copyright tracks on Youtube; simply search for no copyright background music or get it from other sites that provide a free-royalty background music.

![add background music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-music-test-video.jpg)

## Add a Logo/Watermark

To add a logo or watermark to your video, follow these steps:

* Import your Business Logo to the Media Folder.
* Then drag it into the Show Track area.
* Resize it to the ideal dimensions, then position it in the correct location in your video. It's preferable to place it at the top or button section of the video.

You may also add your company's logo at the end of the video as a fade-out transition.

![add business logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

By adding a logo or watermark to your video, you can make it harder for people to illegally distribute and share your video without permission. It helps also to promote your brand or business. When viewers see your logo or watermark throughout the video, they will be more likely to remember who made the video and where they can find more information about your company or products.

## Insert Thumbnail

A video thumbnail is an image that represents your video to viewers. It should be eye-catching, but not so much that it's distracting. The right video thumbnail can help you increase views and engagement on your content.

Place the thumbnail at the beginning of the video, and make sure it's catchy! Your viewers won't have time to look at it in detail, but they will glance at it in passing. Make sure to include relevant text and images that can hook your audience and keep them watching!

![insert thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/insert-subnail-filmora.jpg)

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline. When you have many videos and photos imported into the timeline, you can add them simultaneously.

Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. To add an item to your timeline, follow the steps mentioned.

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want to add to the timeline.
* Keep holding the right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-6.png)

##### Step4 Adding Movement to your Shots

The next step would be to use the movement option in Keyframing, where you can pan and zoom a shot over a specified time. To do this, follow the bullet points below.

* After importing your clips to the timeline, double-click the clip to open the Editing Menu.

![clip editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-7.png)

* Once opened, the editing menu will have a Basic tab; click it.
* **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your clip.

![first keyframe created](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-8.png)

* You need to add a second keyframe at the end of the clip to create movement. First, move the timeline cursor to the end of the clip. Then, check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button again for a second Keyframe.
* Now change the scale of the clip from the slider options in the **Custom Animation**

![adding keyframes and varying clip scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-9.png)

* Now **play** your clip, and you'll see it zooms in and pans automatically to the state of the second keyframe over that timeline.

![final result of added movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-10.gif)

##### Step5 Adding Motion to your Shots

Keyframing can add motion to your project's objects, clips, or images. To perform this in Filmora, follow these instructions:

* Go to the Stock Media tab on the top left ribbon in Filmora and download some motion elements (videos/GIFs) from accessible outlets like the **Flora GIF** used here.
* After importing elements to the timeline, **double-click** the element to open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-11.png)

* Once opened, the **editing menu** will have a Basic tab; **click**
* **Check** the key-shaped button in the Basic Tab. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element.

![adding keyframes from the transform option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-12.png)

* Next, move it to the end of the clip, check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button, and add another keyframe there, but this time, change its scale and rotation attributes as you like.

![changing scale and rotation of clip at the second keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-13.png)

* Enter **OK** and play your clip to see the fantastic effect.

![final result of added motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-14.gif)

##### Step6 Keyframing Opacity

Keyframing allows creators to integrate variable opacity in their shots to instill a dramatic feel. This technique also helps create perfect fade-in and fade-out shots for your videos. Additionally, it is for theatrically dissolving shots too.  
For an illustrated guide to keyframing opacity, keep on reading the following instructions:

* Add a Keyframe to a clip on your timeline. For it, double-click the clip to open the Editing Menu, Then go to Basic Tab.
* Check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element.

![creating an initial keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-15.png)

* **Move** the red cursor to the end of the clip.

![moving the keyframe to the end of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-16.png)

* Next, add another keyframe, scroll down in the editing menu, and remove the **opacity** from the slider below the Bend Mode option.

![decreasing the opacity at the second keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-17.png)

* That's it; you have a theatrical variation of the clip's visible opacity throughout the timeline.

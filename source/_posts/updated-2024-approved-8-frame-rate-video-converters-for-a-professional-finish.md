## 8 Frame Rate Video Converters for a Professional Finish

One important aspect to consider when creating high-quality videos is the frame rate. The frame rate, measured in frames per second (fps), determines the smoothness and fluidity of your video. If the frame rate is too low, your video may appear choppy or stutter. On the other hand, a higher frame rate can provide a more cinematic experience.

However, not all cameras or devices record videos at the same frame rate. That's where frame rate video converters come in. These tools allow you to change the frame rate of your videos so they can be played back on different devices or platforms. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to know which frame rate converters to use.

In this article, we'll look at 8 of the best frame rate video converters you must try. These tools will help you achieve the perfect frame rate for your videos, from free online options to paid software.

## Unknown Facts About Converting Frame Rates

When converting frame rates, there are a few things to keep in mind that you may need to be made aware of.

![facts about converting frame rates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facts-convert-frame-rate.jpg)

### 1\. The Web Doesn't Care About Frame Rates

First, it's important to note that the web doesn't care about frame rates. Most online platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo, automatically adjust the frame rate of videos to match the viewer's device or internet connection. This means that even if you have a video with a high frame rate, it may be automatically downgraded when it's uploaded to the web.

### 2\. Converting Frame Rates in Exact Multiples Is Easy

Another thing to remember is that converting frame rates in exact multiples is relatively easy.

For example, if you have a video recorded at 30 fps and want to convert it to 60 fps, it's a simple process as it is a 2x multiple. However, if you want to convert your video to a frame rate that is not a multiple of the original, such as 29.97 fps, the process can be more complex and may result in some loss of quality.

### 3\. Frame Rate Is Not "Cinematic"

Lastly, it's important to note that frame rate is not "cinematic" because a higher frame rate does not automatically make your video look more cinematic. While a higher frame rate can provide a more smooth and more fluid video, it's just one aspect of creating a cinematic experience. Other elements, such as lighting, composition, and sound design, also play a crucial role in creating a cinematic look.

## This Article Aims to Provide a Step-by-Step Guide to Changing a Video's Speed by Using the Speed Adjustment Panel and Duration Panel on Wondershare Filmora

Speeding and slowing down the speed of a video is a marvel in the video editing world. In the older days, this feat was accomplished only by the big-budget filming industry.

This article will dive into how you can access the modern-day features available in video editing software. From these features, you can alter the speed of your video easily. However, before we get into the step-by-step guide, let's understand what fast and slow-mo videos are.

## Part 1\. What Are Fast and Slow Motion Videos?

As the name suggests, fast-motion videos are the ones that have been sped up from their average speed.

![difference between normal and fast speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-1.gif)

Similarly, slow-motion videos are the ones that have been slowed down from their average speed. The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.

![difference between normal speed and slow speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-2.gif)

Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are. Let's understand their applications. Or how you can use them in your videos. Scroll below to learn more!

## Part 2\. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

The answer to this question would be that it's a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.

### Fast Motion Videos

Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.

The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.

The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.

### Slow Motion Videos

You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.

A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first **Matrix** film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.

![famous bullet dodging scene in the matrix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-3.png)

You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.

Before we get into the editing process, let's first understand what you will need to change the speed of your videos!

## Part 3\. What Will You Need to Change the Speed of Your Videos?

You will need the following essentials to change the speed of a video:

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.

## Part 4\. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:

* The speed adjustment panel.
* Duration panel settings.

Let's get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.

### 1\. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel

The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.

You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.

But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!

##### Step1 Download Filmora

First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.

##### Step2 Import The Video Files

The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and select the **Import** icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.
* It takes you to your computer's library.
* Select the videos to be edited and then click **OK**.

![wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-5.png)

You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:

* **Drag** the cursor to select the video clips you want.

![import video clips by drag and drop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png)

Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the **Mp4**,   **AVI**, **MOV**, **GIFs,** and more.

After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!

##### Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline

After you've imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:

* **Drag** the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, **insert** them into the timeline.

![wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png)

Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.

##### Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel

The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:

* **Double-click** on the video clip.
* In the **pop-up** column, scroll down till you see the **Unifrom Speed** option and click on it.
* The speed controls will be shown in the import window.

![wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png)

In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.

**1.00** is always the average speed. **0.5** being half and **2.00** being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:

* **To increase the speed:** Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.
* **To decrease the speed:** Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.

The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.

* Click on The **Audio** icon above the import window.

These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let's move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.

### 2\. Change Speed via the Duration Panel

The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.

This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.

It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.

Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.

##### Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline

After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and click the **Import** icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.
* Choose the videos to be edited, then click **OK**.

Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:

* Drag the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, insert them into the timeline.

You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.

##### Step2 Open The Duration Panel

The Duration Panel comes attached to the **Unifrom Speed Panel**. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.
* In the pop column, scroll below to **Unifrom Speed**.

It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.

##### Step3 Change The Speed of The Video

In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to **reduce** the speed of your video, you have to **increase** the duration of your video. Similarly, if you're going to **increase** the speed of your video, you would have to **decrease** the duration.

##### Slow Down The Video

To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:

* In The Duration Panel, **Increase** the time of the video.
* Type in a number bigger than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If the average speed of the video is **00:01:00:00,** increasing the value of the duration to **00:02:00:00** will reduce the speed of your video by half.

![wondershare filmora adjusting slowing down the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-17.png)

##### Speed Up The Video

To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:

* In The Duration Panel, **decrease** the time of the video.
* Type in a number smaller than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.

**1.00** is always the average speed. **0.5** being half and **2.00** being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:

* **To increase the speed:** Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.
* **To decrease the speed:** Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.

The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.

These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let's move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.

### 2\. Change Speed via the Duration Panel

The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.

This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.

It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.

Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.

##### Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline

After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and click the **Import** icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.
* Choose the videos to be edited, then click **OK**.

Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:

* Drag the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, insert them into the timeline.

You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.

##### Step2 Open The Duration Panel

The Duration Panel comes attached to the **Unifrom Speed Panel**. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.
* In the pop column, scroll below to **Unifrom Speed**.

It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.

##### Step3 Change The Speed of The Video

In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to **reduce** the speed of your video, you have to **increase** the duration of your video. Similarly, if you're going to **increase** the speed of your video, you would have to **decrease** the duration.

##### Slow Down The Video

To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:

* In The Duration Panel, **Increase** the time of the video.
* Type in a number bigger than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If the average speed of the video is **00:01:00:00,** increasing the value of the duration to **00:02:00:00** will reduce the speed of your video by half.

![wondershare filmora adjusting slowing down the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-17.png)

##### Speed Up The Video

To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:

* In The Duration Panel, **decrease** the time of the video.
* Type in a number smaller than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If the normal video speed is **00:01:00:00,** decreasing the value of the duration to **00:00:30:00** will increase the speed of your video by double.

![wondershare filmora speeding up a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-18.png)

Congratulations! You have successfully learned how to change the speed of your video by Filmora. Now, you can use both the Speed Adjustment Panel and The Duration Panel to adjust the speed of your video.

## In This Article, We Will Discuss What Lens Distortion Is, How It May Be Fixed, and the Factors You Need to Pay Attention to Avoid Lens Distortion when Taking or Recording Videos

The distortion in your video may irritate you when you're working on the video's edit. When you take images or record sound, you frequently end up with distorted results due to lens distortion. In this article, we will discuss what lens distortion is, how it may be fixed, and the factors you need to pay attention to avoid lens distortion when taking or recording videos.

## Part 1: Basic introduction to lens distortion

**1\. What is lens distortion**

Distortion means that the straight rectilinear projection is not straight. In the pinhole camera model, lens distortion is measured by how far from the image's ideal projection is. From a geometric optics point of view, the scene's straight lines don't look straight in the image.

When you take a picture, the camera lens can somehow change the shape of the image. It is called camera lens distortion. In simple terms, we can tell you that this is the case because distortion in-camera is when the lens makes curved lines in an image and doesn't show the straight lines from the scene.

**2\. What cause it**

Lens distortion happens with all lenses. It is because of several things, such as how the lens is curved, how far away the subject is, and the angle at which the photo was taken. Furthermore, it changes the image in many ways, but you can see it most when straight lines at the frame's edges are no longer parallel.

Most geometric lens distortions happen when the focal distance is short (barrel distortion), long (pincushion distortion), or when a fish-eye lens is used to take a picture from a low angle (keystone distortion).

## Part 2: How to correct a distorted lens?

A lot of times, with lower-end wide-angle lenses, especially action cams like GoPro, you get pretty gnarly distortion when you're filming. As we know, the Earth is round, but it shouldn't look like this when you take a picture. Indeed, it's very distorted, it has the horizon line bending all over the place, and basically, all of the lines in the video have some level of curvature.

Hence, follow all the steps below to know how to fix it:

Step1 Import your video to [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

![import your video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-1.jpg)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step2 Click on the clip and head over to the lens correction. Choose the "Camera model" based on what you used, but in this tutorial, the video was taken with a GoPro Hero 7\. However, you can choose some other camera model options there.

![click on the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-2.jpg)

Step3 To adjust the distortion, you can slide the bar to the left or the right. If you slide the bar to the right (maximum level), there will be no adjustment. However, if you slide the bar to the left, you can see it pulling those lines as high up as possible.

You can see a bit of curvature, but it looks much more natural, and all of the lines in the video look so much better.

![adjust the distortion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-3.gif)

Step4 Lastly, if you play the video back, you will see the video look much better than before.

![play the video back](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/correct-lense-distortion-4.gif)

## Part 3: How to avoid distorted lens while shooting?

**1\. Avoid very wide-angle lenses**

The more distortion there is in a lens, like a 15mm prime, the wider it is. Sometimes you need a very wide-angle lens, and distortion is unavoidable. If you have room to move back, you could try using a lens with a different focal length.

**2\. Avoid getting too close**

Doing so will enhance optical distortion in many lenses and the likelihood of perspective distortion in all lenses.

**3\. Be mindful of your composition**

There are numerous instances where distortion is acceptable or even intended. Others must be carefully examined, such as utilizing a wide-angle lens to photograph a row of people. When you get too close to a group, the distortion makes the people at each end appear considerably wider! Therefore, consider your composition. Stand back and add space around your group; if necessary, you can trim the image afterward.

**4\. Use a 50mm lens**

50mm lenses are often called "all-purpose" lenses. There is a good reason

for this. A 50mm lens is great for portraits, street photography, and many other kinds of photography, including architecture. If your subject is big, you just need space to stand back. You will see that a 50mm lens rarely distorts the image.

## Easy Guide to Zoom Video in VLC

Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.

You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.

## Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom

VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.

Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.

Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.

Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.

Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg)

Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg)

Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.

## Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu

Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.

Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.

Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-vlc-zoom-options.jpg)

Otherwise, you can press Shift + Z keys together to try out different zoom options.

## Part 3: Zoom VLC Video Using Magnifier

If you are using VLC Media Player on your Windows desktop computer, you can use the inbuilt Magnifier tool to zoom into a video that you are playing on VLC. You can zoom into videos to read any text in the background but this leads to low resolution and distortion. You can zoom in by 16 times which is the highest among all the three methods. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom video using Magnifier tool.

Step1Open VLC Player and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Start menu on Windows and search for “Magnifier”.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-vlc-video-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Click on Magnifier App. Once it opens, place the mouse pointer on the video and you will see its magnified version.

Step4Press Windows and “+” keys to zoom in while press Windows and “-“ keys to zoom out.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjust-magnifier-windows.jpg)

## Part 4: VLC Alternative to Zoom in Videos

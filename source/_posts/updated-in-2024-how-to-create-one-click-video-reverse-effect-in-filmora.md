## How to Create One Click Video Reverse Effect in Filmora

All great video editors use phenomenal video effects in their videos. One of the most professional effects is the reverse video effect. This unique effect is always challenging for the makers to shoot and portray on the screen flawlessly.

At the same time, it is intriguing and always draws the audience's attention. In this article, you will learn to shoot and edit the video for reverse effects using Filmora. But first, we will learn what does video reverse effect mean. So let us get into this!

## Part 1\. What Is Video Reverse Effect?

It is a special video effect in which a motion of things starts in the backward direction. This unique effect is used to intrigue the audience.

For example, if a bullet is fired from a gun. With the reverse effect, you can rewind the footage, and the shot goes back into the gun. So today, you can easily rewind fast action scenes and get a wow reaction from the audience.

### Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films

**1- Demolition of a Wall (1896)**

Filmmakers first used this striking effect in 1896 in a 90 seconds film, "Demolition of a wall." Louis Lumiere was the one who made that video. Below is shown an image from the film.

![demolition of a wall 1896](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-1.png)

**2- Tenet (2020)**

It is a viral film by Christopher Nolan, which was a great success. He explained the concept of reverse entropy, in which you start moving back chronologically in time instead of forward. This concept is all shown through this special video reverse effect. Unfortunately, the audience had difficulty digesting this unique concept, which generated an awful response.

![tenet 2020](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-2.png)

## Part 2\. How To Shoot Video Reverse Effect?

The reverse effect is unique, so special attention should be paid while filming a video. This section will cover some of the crucial prerequisites to film a video.

### Steady Camera

It would be best to have your camera placed on a steady surface or mounted on a tripod stand to lock the focus. We will split the area and perform different tasks to make it look smooth. The audience will not get the idea that you completed the tasks separately. And it helps in the editing process as well.

![keep your camera steady](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-3.png)

### A Spacious Area

You will need a spacious area in which you will perform different tasks. Make sure your camera stands still while shooting all the frames of video. In an ample space, it becomes easier to do movements freely. It also helps prevent glitches in the final product.

### Splitting of Area into Portions

Now you have to split your area into portions. Each task is in its part of the frame, and actions in one frame should not pass over into another. You will do one activity per portion. It makes the editing process a lot easier. Finally, we get all three videos to merge and make it look like a single video.

![making three portions of the area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-4.png)

After covering the prerequisites, we will now learn the editing process of creating a video reverse effect.

Doing so will allow you to work in your zone quickly and efficiently. You can do a manual rendering before you begin the editing process. Or you can also opt to choose automatic rendering. In the automatic rendering option, you can continue your editing process. In the meantime, your timeline will be rendered.

### How to Delete Render Cache in Filmora

Step1 Click on **files** in the top left corner of the Wondershare Filmora home interface.

Step2 Go to **Preferences**.

Step6 Click on **OK** to save your changes.

Now, whenever you close your project, your render cache will be deleted and would have given you extra space on your computer.

## Part 4\. Remove Split Button on Playhead

In some instances, when you are moving the playhead on the timelines, it can distract you from doing your editing. Or even more, you can mistakenly click on the Split button to split the clips you don't want them to.

Well, no worries at all! Wondershare Filmora takes care of that for you. You can hide or remove the Split button on the playhead. It only takes a few simple and easy steps. Follow the steps mentioned below to remove the Split button:

Step6 Check the box. Then, click **OK** to save your changes.

Doing so would have removed the Split button from your playhead. So now you can edit your videos without any distractions.

## Part 5\. Copy and Paste Effects

Copy and paste are one of the oldest tricks in editing procedures. Wondershare Filmora comes with a range of commands and features that allow you to save time and be reliable.

Suppose you want to add an effect to a video clip in the timeline. Then, after adding the effect to your video, make custom changes to make it look more closely to the style you want. You can now use the copy-and-paste function to add the same effect to another clip. That helps you save a lot of time from tedious and time-consuming work.

### How to Copy and Paste Effects

While editing, you will need to ensure that your editing process is as clean as possible and that you have all the time on hand.

But there is a solution! You can easily copy and paste the effects you placed on one video clip to another. Just follow the steps mentioned, and you will be good to go:

Step8 It adjusts the video clip according to the changes of the prior one.

![wondershare filmora copy and paste effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-5.png)

## Part 6\. Timeline Snap

You might have added multiple videos in the same timeline track. If you removed the video ahead of the video clip, you have to close the gap in between.

So, arranging and moving clips in the timeline are hectic and time-consuming. However, that is the case without timeline snapping.

### How to Apply Timeline Snap in Filmora

**Timeline snapping** will allow you to arrange video clips side by side without any breaks and cut-offs. Also, it will enable you to place it precisely above other video and audio gaps in the timeline.

In most cases, Timeline snapping is enabled from the start. But if you are encountering some problems managing your videos. Or if you want to remove the Timeline snap feature. Follow the steps mentioned below:

Step1 Right-click on the **Timeline**.

Step2 A pop will open up, giving you multiple options.

Step3 Click on **timeline Snapping** to either enable it or disable it.

![wondershare filmora enabling timeline snap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-6.png)

Now you can easily enable and disable timeline snapping according to your choice!

## Part 7\. Color Code Video Clips

When editing footage from multiple cameras, you might want to organize which media is from which source in the timeline. You can do this by color coding your clips.

### Steps to Color Code Your Videos

Color coding allows you to edit all the clips marked with a particular color to be selected simultaneously without selecting them manually in the timeline.

To color code a video, follow the steps as mentioned:

Step1 Select the clips you want to color code, right-click, and choose from the available colors.

Step2 Once you've color coded your clips, you can right-click on the clip again and choose to select all clips from the color mark option.

![wonderhshare filmora color coding videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-7.png)

## Part 8\. Group Clips Together

Now in an editing timeline, you might encounter a situation where you want to arrange a video clip with specific audio. Again, it allows you to stay organized and save up a lot of time.

Grouping clips together can also be helpful when you want to edit multiple clips in the timeline but want to maintain a particular order. The group will remain in its place and allow you to edit your other video clips quickly.

## Part 9\. Pan and Zoom Shortcut

Editing shortcuts are excellent. They allow you to save up a lot of time. Some people prefer to use a mouse only to edit their videos, but professionals always use a keyboard.

But there are some other shortcuts too! In these shortcuts, you would not necessarily need a keyboard; only a mouse will work and give a good outcome.

You might have seen those videos in which a specific screen ratio moves over a picture. Or, in some cases when you have to pan and zoom to create a flow effect.

Instead of **manually** adjusting the ratio of your videos and photos, Pan and Zoom shortcuts will allow you to use multiple features. These features allow you to select where your video or photo will start, zoom, and end.

These shortcuts are so easy to apply. Just go through the steps below, and you will accomplish the following:

## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

But several movie directors have effectively used the **freeze-frame** video editing technique that wowed the audience.

Here is a list of the best **freeze frame examples** you would love;

The **freeze-frame** came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.

During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.

The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, "Ding Dong."

The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.

### 03**400 Blows**

### 04**Thelma and Louise**

![Thelma and Louise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-4.jpg)

Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.

While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.

Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a **freeze-frame** as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.

Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.

### 05**The Wolf of Wall Street**

![The wolf of wall street](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-5.jpg)

After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.

Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a **freeze-frame** brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.

### 09**Good Fellas**

![Good fellas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-9.jpg)

Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in 'Good Fellas' to emphasize the movie plot.

In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.

They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a **freeze-frame** before uttering the lines, "As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster."

This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.

Pulp Fiction is another movie such as 'Good Fellas' with its freeze-frame edition done at the movie's beginning.

The **freeze-frame** gives us a sneak peek of the violence to experience in the movie, and indeed, we were not disappointed.

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

* The paid version is very expensive in comparison to others.

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

### Cons

* It does not have a preview. You have to generate the voice-over to listen.
* You can't combine a single audio file out of many audio files.
* The Voiceover & Editor Page is unique in that it has two sections: one for creating the voice-over and another for obtaining audio files. Switching between them will take some time. If you're working on a large project, moving between bot sites will be a hassle.
* No project-based organization

### Cons

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

You should check for text-to-speech software with natural voices enabled in commercial applications. A top-rated system should include real-time speech capabilities and a user-friendly UI.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video. No matter how wonderful or perfect a video clip is, if the audio playing while watching it is terrible, it may be a very frustrating experience. So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

1. Navigate to the "Edit" page.
2. Select the tab "Media Pool."
3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

It's best to link the soundtrack (music, sound effect, or background music) to the relevant video once you've adjusted the audio file.

Here's how to connect audio and video in a timeline:

1. Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" to toggle both the video and audio.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."
3. The sound and visual are now both connected.

Thus, you can rest guaranteed that the audio will follow your movie wherever it goes. There will be no issues with out-of-sync!

### **How Do You Link Many Audio and Video Files Together in DaVinci Resolve?**

Several video and audio segments can be linked together to form a single one. You can rearrange them anywhere in the timeline, and they will not be out of sync.

This is how you connect many clips:

1. By holding down the "Ctrl" or "Cmd" key, you can choose all the video and audio clips you want.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcut keys "Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L".
3. Now, all your video or audio files are linked together.

### **Is Any Music Available to Use for Editing?**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

1. Navigate to the "Edit" page.
2. Select the tab "Media Pool."
3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

It's best to link the soundtrack (music, sound effect, or background music) to the relevant video once you've adjusted the audio file.

Here's how to connect audio and video in a timeline:

1. Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" to toggle both the video and audio.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."
3. The sound and visual are now both connected.

Thus, you can rest guaranteed that the audio will follow your movie wherever it goes. There will be no issues with out-of-sync!

### **How Do You Link Many Audio and Video Files Together in DaVinci Resolve?**

Several video and audio segments can be linked together to form a single one. You can rearrange them anywhere in the timeline, and they will not be out of sync.

This is how you connect many clips:

1. By holding down the "Ctrl" or "Cmd" key, you can choose all the video and audio clips you want.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcut keys "Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L".
3. Now, all your video or audio files are linked together.

### **Is Any Music Available to Use for Editing?**

Understanding copyright law can be complicated. It's best to use free music for video editing if you don't want to be accused of copyright violation.

Additionally, you can purchase two licenses to avoid copyright concerns. The producer controls the synchronization license, and the master license to use the song recording is managed by the publishing company.

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

### **Is There Any Free Music in DaVinci Resolve?**

DaVinci Resolve does not include any free music; however, it does include royalty-free sound effects noise. To get started, you can download and install the available sound package.

### **What Software Provides Free Music?**

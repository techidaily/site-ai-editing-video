## Easy Way to Create an Alternate Reality Effect

Ditch boring one-dimensional videos and create a mesmerizing video with this alternative reality effect you can easily create using Wondershare Filmora.

This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?

Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.

![a preview of the alternate reality effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-1.gif)

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

## Editing the video

If you have your footage or stock video ready, then you can start editing. Follow this simple step-by-step guide to create your own alternate reality using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Adding motion blur After Effects Is a fantastic tool for making items mix more naturally in your compositions. Let's quickly examine Motion Blur with all of this in mind. To help you better grasp motion blur and how to add motion blur to flawlessly merge objects in your video projects or even create styled effects, we've put up a detailed guide here.

2. [Utilize Filmstock](#part3-2)
3. [Edit Effect](#part3-3)
4. [Apply filters](#part3-4)
5. [Export](#part3-5)

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 2\. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Part 2\. How to Add Motion Blur in After Effects

In videos, slow-motion may be used in a variety of ways, such as to convey the emotional context of a story or make beautiful slideshow backdrops. It doesn't matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects' slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.

You'll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:

**Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:**

So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur's magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.

Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn't already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose "New Project" to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.

Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose "Effects & Presets." A search bar will appear as a result. Enter "CC Force Motion Blur" in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.

Step3 Next, drag the "CC Force Motion Blur" to the layers that represent your imported video at the bottom left of the screen. On the left side of the screen, under "CC Force Motion Blur," you will find settings for motion blur. Here, you may change the motion blur to suit your needs. You may type in the values and watch the video as appropriate. There are several choices available for you to modify.

**Note:** Before applying any speed effects, first trim your film to the proper length. Once the speed effects have been included, you need also make sure that your composition is lengthy enough for your clip. Once you're satisfied with the footage you want to slow down, choose one of the ways—Time warp or Time Stretch.

Step4 Customize "Shutter Angle" and "Motion Blur Samples." Always be careful to preview the video after any modifications. Adjust to your needs and specifications. Additionally, if you wish, you may add any additional effect to the video. When finished, save the video by selecting "File" in the upper left corner.

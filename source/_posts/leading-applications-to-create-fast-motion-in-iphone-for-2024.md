Apart from making videos, you can also make two-part duets on TikTok. Additionally, TikTok allows you to record with different formats; follow the steps below.

* Firstly, go to the video you would like to edit and click the three-dot icon to edit your video.
* Once you edit the video by changing the format or adding another part, save your video, and TikTok allows you to post your video again.

1. **Place Videos Side by Side**

Another tip we have in store for you is how you can place videos side by side on TikTok; the steps below help you achieve this.

![combile-tiktok-videos-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-20.jpg)

* First, click the ‘star’ button at the side of your screen and select ‘add to favorite.’
* Now, record a second video on your TikTok or simply import it if you have already recorded the video.
* Download the first video, and you can use the combining feature on TikTok to make the video run next to each other
* Once you’re satisfied, you can now proceed to post your video.

1. **Learn to Perform Duets on TikTok**

Another thing you can do on TikTok is to duet with other TikTok users

![combile-tiktok-videos-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-21.jpg)

* To do this, go to TikTok and find the video you would like to duet
* At the end of the screen, click on the ‘share’ option and choose ‘duet’ from the option available
* Tap the red icon at the middle of the screen to start recording your video; your video usually appears on the left while the other video shows up in the right corner.
* Once you’re done recording, click the checkmark icon at the top of the screen to save your recording.
* Replay the duet to ensure you like the result; you can add effects, stickers, and other editing features you want to the video before you post.

1. **Set a Timer for Recording Videos**

One of the ways you can record multiple scenes for a video is by using the recording tool; the steps below show you how to do that.

![combile-tiktok-videos-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-22.jpg)

* Once you launch TikTok and click on the camera icon
* Tap the ‘clock’ icon at the side of the screen; you can choose between 3-10 seconds
* Click the red circle to start recording
* A countdown on the screen gives you time to get ready to record. Once the countdown gets to zero, TikTok starts recording your video.

1. **Use the Stitch Feature**

Stitched videos allow you to add the first maker’s details in the new video; these details connect TikTok users to the first video. It is quite easy to stitch one video to another. Simply navigate to the ‘privacy and settings’ tab, and you can enable or disable stitching for your TikTok videos; you can also turn this on and off for your videos. Follow the steps below to stitch your TikTok videos.

![combile-tiktok-videos-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-23.jpg)

* Open the TikTok app and choose the video you would like to stitch
* Now choose the three-dot icon and select the ‘advanced’ option
* You can stitch up to five seconds from the video you would like to stick to add to the current video.
* You can add recordings to the stitched option and then stitch them together to post.

**Final Thoughts**

Whether you’re a stranger to the TikTok scene or a professional, TikTok is quite popular as a video-sharing platform. However, you don’t always get it right the first time, and you might want to combine various videos into one perfect option to upload. Apart from the two practical ways you can do this on TikTok, we also share three third-party apps you can use to achieve this. You can also explore the seven tips shared in this article to maximize your potential on the TikTok app.

![select newblue filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-3.jpg)

Step3 Find the Selective Color Effect and drag it onto the clip. The effect will be instantly applied.

![selective color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-4.jpg)

Step4 Next, double-click on the clip and check out the effects menu at the top of the screen.

![effects menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-5.jpg)

Step5 Open the preset drop-down menu. There will be a lot of presets with different colors. Select the preset you want to use. In this scenario, let us select Just Blue.

![select the preset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-6.jpg)

Step6 If you see a blue tint at a place or object which you want to be white and black, click on the first color.

![first color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-7.jpg)

Step7 Now adjust the range slider to decrease the number of unwanted tints.

![adjusting the range slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-8.jpg)

Step8 To blur the edges of the effects, turn up the softened slider and remove any unwanted tint previously remaining.

In this way, you can add a selective color effect to your video clips and isolate the color of your choice.

## Tutorial 2 on make color isolation using eyedropper tool

You might ask how do we use the eyedropper tool here. It can sample colors from anywhere in a video or an image and add them to your swatch panel. The steps to use the eyedropper tool to add a selective color to your video are below.

Step1 As same as the first one, launching Wondershare Filmora is the first priority. And drag your clip to the timeline.

![drag clip to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-10.jpg)

Step2 Go to effects at the top, and find Newblue effects, and click on the Newblue filters.

![newblue effects and filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-11.jpg)

Step3 Find the selective color effect and drag it to the clip.

![select the first color and eye dropper tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-14.jpg)

Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.

![clicking on the second color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-15.jpg)

Step7 Pick the eyedropper tool and click it on the green part of the clip. Then adjust the range slider as needed.

![adjusting range slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-16.jpg)

## Use Mobile Phones to Shoot a Video Is Very Convenient Compare with Professional Cameras. In This Article, Weâ€™ll List You some Tips to Help Capture a High-Quality Video on Your Phone

Never before has video recording been so simple or effortless. Everybody has a smartphone, which is a capable video camera, in their pocket. In fact, the use of smartphones for mobile creation has increased to the point that some people consider it to be the main function and equally crucial to communication.

Pocket-lint has compiled ten ideas in an effort to assist you in getting whatever it is you want in the best possible way. Even if some of the advice may seem apparent, using it all should always produce fantastic videos.

![shoot a video on phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/shoot-a-video-on-phone.jpg)

## 1\. Get ready for filming

Make sure that you have everything you need to start recording your videos, including the necessary

equipment, props, scripts, actors, and locations, before you start the recording process. In addition, ensure that your mobile device is of high quality and that it has a sufficient amount of storage space (available memory) to save the film. High definition (HD) video files can be quite large and storing them can quickly deplete a battery's capacity.

![get ready for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/get-ready-for-filming.jpg)

They add a great point; you need to think about stabilization, and they've included a few great options for

obtaining steady video. This video by Filmic Pro titled "5 Things to Do Before You Shoot iPhone Video" covers a lot of what we've discussed as well, including memory storage, battery life, audio, and resolution.

## 2\. Use good lighting

Because smartphone cameras have smaller image sensors and lenses, proper illumination has a significant impact on their performance. As much as you can, try to film your video in well-lit environments. By doing this, you can reduce the amount of unwanted shadow and grain in your video. On the other hand, you also need to be cautious to avoid pointing the camera straight towards bright light sources because this will result in useless overexposed footage and lens flare. The lighting should be consistent and steady because most smartphone image sensors take a while to respond to abrupt changes in brightness.

![use good lighting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/use-good-lighting.jpg)

If shooting your video in low light is still difficult, experiment with your phone's or app's backlighting and white balance settings. In case your camera is focusing on the incorrect part of your composition, most phones now provide "touch focusing." The automatic exposure control will have an easier time making minor adjustments if the lighting condition changes once the focus has been placed on the most crucial part of the video.

## 3\. Film horizontally, not vertically

Your natural inclination may be to hold the smartphone in a vertical position when you are using it to record video, just as you do when you are using it for the vast majority of other purposes. However, if you want to edit your video and post it online and on social media, this may place certain restrictions on your ability to do so.

![film horizontally mobile phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/film-horizontally-mobile-phone.jpg)

## 4\. Make sure to have good audio

We're going to go ahead and say that sound is one of the most essential components of any video. The difficulty is in the fact that the audio quality on your smartphone is not always of the highest caliber. When it comes to audio, there is a general rule that the smartphone should be as close to the speaker as is physically possible in order to obtain the clearest sound possible from it. Even if you are only a few meters away from the person whose voice you want to record on your smartphone, you won't be able to get a good recording of them.

This is not the fault of your smartphone; rather, smartphones are intended to be used by speaking into them at close range; hence, you should think about employing the use of an external microphone in order to improve the sound quality. However, if you are unable to do so, there is no need for concern because you can use an additional smartphone in its place.

You can record audio on your mobile device by opening the voice memo app and selecting the record button. Your audio will immediately be improved if you position the phone's microphone such that it is facing your topic and is somewhat close to them. Clap once at the beginning of the recording to serve as a reference point for both the video and the audio, which will help you save time while editing. After that, it will be simple for you to locate the point at which the clap occurred and synchronize the high-quality audio that is on the memo with the audio that is in your film.

## 5\. Edit your video

Now that you've gathered all of your film, it's time to cut it up, add some color, and get creative with effects! Fortunately, there are numerous video editing apps available that make it easier and faster than ever to use. You can edit videos on your phone just as you would on a computer using apps like Adobe Rush and iMovie, and it's easier than you think.

![edit video on mobile phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/edit-video-on-mobile-phone.jpg)

You've probably heard of iMovie, Apple's free video editing software that works on both your iPhone and Mac. You can add titles, music, and additional effects to your video clips, much like in Adobe Rush. iMovie is really easy to use, especially if you're new to editing. The main distinction between Adobe Rush and iMovie is that Adobe Rush includes more professional and technical changes, whilst iMovie has a considerably larger selection of video effects and transitions.

Adobe Rush is the most user-friendly app for editing and creating high-quality films on your smartphone. One of Adobe Rush's best features is the ability to incorporate motion graphics, video effects, text, and mix audio. If you prefer a larger screen to edit on, Adobe Rush seamlessly transfers the files to your computer, allowing you to resume editing where you left off on your smartphone. This program is simple to use, and there are numerous guidelines and tutorials available online to help you get started.

## Conclusion

You probably weren't aware of this, but your smartphone is actually a very capable piece of equipment that can be used to record videos of a high quality. You will be able to enhance the quality of your material to a greater extent by putting into practice the strategies that are discussed in this piece. Grab your smartphone and get ready to start producing content that the people in your fanbase will always come back for.

## Level Up Videos By Applying Keyframe Like A Pro

Everyone is fascinated by a video portraying creativity and effort in each frame. Your films can easily have this captivity through the keyframe feature. It provides you the accessibility to make even a simple, plain shot pace up, slow down, or pan across the screen.

Wondershare Filmora offers you a simple yet great experience of Keyframing. It has been the editors' favorite feature for years. Under its Grow and Win Program, Filmora presents the Keyframe creativity contest. It is the ultimate solution for bringing captivity and precision to your shots.

## Part 1\. What is the Keyframe Feature?

A keyframe, also spelled "key frame," defines any smooth transition's beginning and conclusion. In the case of animation or film, or video, that something may be a drawing or a specific frame of a shot.

The keyframe feature creates room for boundless creativity. The Keyframe feature could imitate any illusive or fascinating impact, from object enlargement to magical power effects. A key frame is a frame that serves as a marker for the start or stop of a parameter change.

You could use a keyframe to mark the spot where the audio will have faded up or down to a specific volume.

## Part 2\. Where to Use The Keyframe Feature?

Editors and creators use keyframing for all kinds of stuff. These uses include:

### Animated Logo Intros

You can use the keyframe feature to create indigenous intros with animated logos. It helps the editors go for vlogging or tutorial videos.

![animated logo intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-1.gif)

### Special Transparency Effects

Keyframing is famous for creating blended visuals through experimentation with the transparency of the clip.

![varying transparency clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-2.gif)

### Custom Picture-in-Picture Paths

We use the picture-in-picture effect in many editing formats, from tutorial videos to gaming streams and vlogs. Keyframing allows editors to execute the movement of the PIP as they wish. For instance, this video call was shot from a video.

![picture-in-picture effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-3.png)

The picture will move across the screen between the 30-second and 1-minute marks if you indicate that it will be in the upper left corner of the screen at the 30-second timestamp of your video and the bottom right corner at the 1-minute timestamp.

## Part 3\. What Would You Need to Make a Keyframe Video

Let us share the procedure for making a video using the keyframe feature.

### 1\. A Video Clip or Photos

For experimenting and creating with the keyframe feature, first, you would need high-quality video clips or images.

The high-resolution requirement is a prerequisite for the complete experience of all parameters of the keyframe feature. For example, the zooming and varying opacity effects you add might look bland and dull if the clip or image appears pixelated upon zooming and scaling.

### 2\. Motion Elements

Keyframing allows for a vast area of creativity with motion elements that you can download online. The keyframe feature adds charm to these elements by playing with their orientation and scale.

### 3\. An Advanced Editing Software

## Dubbing Videos With Voiceovers | Using Wondershare Filmora

Voiceovers have been a great utility in the digital ecosystem for a while. From movies to videos, the use of voiceovers has provided content creators with new dynamics. While it has enhanced the quality of video creation, there are other technicalities that have arisen against it. In this article, we will be discussing the details involving voiceovers and recordings.

Also, it includes a discussion of tools that can be used to ensure professional voice recordings. Go through the provided details to know how to utilize voiceovers to perfection.

## Part 1: What is The Difference Between Voice Recording and Voiceover?

Do you know **voiceover** and voice recording are two different terms? They are often used correspondingly but have different meanings. Here are a few differences between the two in the section below:

**Voice Recording**

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations. Ultimately, we can say that voiceover is a part of voice recording that should be synchronized with the visual media to fulfill its purpose.

## A Complete Guide to the Best Brand Story Videos

With the advent of streaming content accessible anytime, anywhere, conventional marketing has somewhat lost grip on its performance. Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.

However, it doesnâ€™t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.

This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their **brand storytelling**. And thereâ€™s no better and highly effective way to portray **your brand story** than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating â€˜Call Todayâ€™ voiceover wonâ€™t be enough to get results.

You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their **branding and storytelling** strategies to engage their customers. If youâ€™re reading this article, youâ€™re aiming to build your own **brand storytelling video** and are wondering how to make it a successful one.

## Part I. The Most Successful Video Practises of Brand Storytelling

### 1\. Spotify - All Ears On You

Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customersâ€™ interests.

One of their latest, popular campaigns is â€˜All Ears On You.â€™ Take a glimpse of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk) to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the usersâ€™ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.

**Learn From Spotifyâ€™s Famous Marketing Practices:**

* **Get the Most Out of Big Data:** The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customersâ€™ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.
* **Leverage User-Generated Content:** Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads donâ€™t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.
* **Utilize The Trending Hashtags &** **Topics**: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts todayâ€™s customers the most. Spotifyâ€™s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.

Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:

* Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms
* Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions

### 2\. Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging

The center of focus of [Airbnbâ€™s brand story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU) revolves around the basic ideology of â€˜belonging.â€™ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can â€˜belong anywhere.â€™

Their official tagline also turned out to be â€˜Belong Anywhere,â€™ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure itâ€™s instantly recognizable.

**Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnbâ€™s Marketing Practices:**

* **Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization**: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.
* **Itâ€™s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story**: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized theyâ€™d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that itâ€™s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.
* **Content Is The King:** Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brandâ€™s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.

### 3\. Apple - Chase

Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.

They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the [iPhone 14 pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk) with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Appleâ€™s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.

Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the â€˜on-the-goâ€™ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.

### 4\. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos

If youâ€™ve watched a Nike video ad featuring [LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FdIAMe1sQno) or others, youâ€™ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They donâ€™t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.

This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audienceâ€™s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.

Thereâ€™s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - â€˜Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:

* They promote the advantages of their productâ€™s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called **benefit-based marketing practice**.
* They **sell brand stories more than their products**, which has always been their primary marketing strategy.
* Nike is very strong in the **social media game**. They leverage user-generated content to create their video ads.
* **Collaborating with influencers** like LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo has always been at the core of their marketing strategy.

### 5\. Bells - Reader

The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the â€˜Bells-Readerâ€™ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.

They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, â€˜Give That Man a Bell, â€™ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.

Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaignâ€™s motto:

**Sentimentality:**

* Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.
* The video hit the emotions on so many levels that youâ€™ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.
* Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.
* To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: [https://www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f).

### 6\. Dove - Youâ€™re More Beautiful Than You Think

The Real Beauty Ad Campaign by Dove focuses on womenâ€™s natural charisma and beauty. The ad emphasizes promoting the self-esteem of every woman. In their â€˜[Dove Real Beauty Sketchesâ€™](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=litXW91UauE) video ad, youâ€™ll find the events to be chosen, arranged, connected, and assessed as meaningful for a specific set of audience.

Although the video adâ€™s primary focus is women's empowerment, itâ€™s still a commercial that promotes Dove products. The ad ends with the phrase â€˜youâ€™re more beautiful than you think,â€™ and a Dove brand logo appears.

Significantly, Dove desires women to know that they are always encouraged, supported, and acknowledged for their real beauty. This storytelling helped Dove boost its product sales without making any direct references.

### 7\. El Gordo - The Spanish Christmas Lottery Ad 2021

Conventionally, youâ€™ll get to know about the arrival of Christmas in Spain when youâ€™ll find the Spanish Christmas Lottery hitting the screens as a commercial. The [Christmas Lotteryâ€™s 2021 ad version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcWQ3PdDLj4) was recorded and created in the picturesque and snowy town of Elizondo.

The ad signifies the spirit of the Christmas festive season and amazingly resonates with the motto of El Gordo - the greatest prize is to share it. They used aesthetics and scenic beauty to allure the viewers and drive them into buying the lottery.

They used the marketing practice of hitting people's emotions during Christmas when they could truly immerse themselves into enjoying things like winning the lottery.

Part I. The Most Successful Video Practises of Brand Storytelling

### 1\. Spotify - All Ears On You

Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customersâ€™ interests.

One of their latest, popular campaigns is â€˜All Ears On You.â€™ Take a glimpse of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk) to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the usersâ€™ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.

**Learn From Spotifyâ€™s Famous Marketing Practices:**

* **Get the Most Out of Big Data:** The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customersâ€™ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.
* **Leverage User-Generated Content:** Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads donâ€™t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.
* **Utilize The Trending Hashtags &** **Topics**: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts todayâ€™s customers the most. Spotifyâ€™s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.

Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:

* Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms
* Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions

### 2\. Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging

The center of focus of [Airbnbâ€™s brand story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU) revolves around the basic ideology of â€˜belonging.â€™ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can â€˜belong anywhere.â€™

Their official tagline also turned out to be â€˜Belong Anywhere,â€™ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure itâ€™s instantly recognizable.

**Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnbâ€™s Marketing Practices:**

* **Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization**: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.
* **Itâ€™s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story**: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized theyâ€™d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that itâ€™s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.
* **Content Is The King:** Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brandâ€™s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.

### 3\. Apple - Chase

Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.

They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the [iPhone 14 pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk) with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Appleâ€™s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.

Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the â€˜on-the-goâ€™ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.

### 4\. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos

If youâ€™ve watched a Nike video ad featuring [LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FdIAMe1sQno) or others, youâ€™ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They donâ€™t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.

This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audienceâ€™s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.

Thereâ€™s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - â€˜Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:

* They promote the advantages of their productâ€™s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called **benefit-based marketing practice**.
* They **sell brand stories more than their products**, which has always been their primary marketing strategy.
* Nike is very strong in the **social media game**. They leverage user-generated content to create their video ads.
* **Collaborating with influencers** like LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo has always been at the core of their marketing strategy.

### 5\. Bells - Reader

The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the â€˜Bells-Readerâ€™ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.

They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, â€˜Give That Man a Bell, â€™ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.

Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaignâ€™s motto:

**Sentimentality:**

* Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.
* The video hit the emotions on so many levels that youâ€™ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.
* Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.
* To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: [https://www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f).

Significantly, Dove desires women to know that they are always encouraged, supported, and acknowledged for their real beauty. This storytelling helped Dove boost its product sales without making any direct references.

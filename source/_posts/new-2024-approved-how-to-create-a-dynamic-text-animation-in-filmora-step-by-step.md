##### Step1 Import Media Into Movie Maker

![import media into windows movie maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/import-media-into-windows-movie-maker.jpg)

The first thing you need to do is get all of your video footage and images into Windows Movie Maker.

Media file formats can be imported into this program:

* **Audio Files**: aif, .aifc, .aiff, .asf, .au, .mp2, .mp3, .mpa, .snd, .wav, and .wma
* **Image Files**: .bmp, .dib, .emf, .gif, .jfif, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff, and .wmf
* **Movie Files**: asf, .avi, dvr-ms, .m1v, .mp2, .mp2v, .mpe, .mpeg, .mpg, .mpv2, .wm, and .wmv

##### Step2 Basic Editing from Timeline

![windows movie maker timeline edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/windows-movie-maker-timeline-edit.jpg)

* For cutting the image, you need to select the part of the image that you want to cut. To do this, just click on the image and drag it to where you want it to be cut. The cutting process will automatically happen when you release your mouse button.
* To combine the images, you need to select the images that you want to combine. To do this, click on one image and then hold down the "Ctrl" key while clicking on the other images that you want to combine. Once you have selected all the images you want to combine, just right-click on any of the selected images and choose "Combine Clips."

##### Step3 Add Video Effects

To add video effects in the **video movie maker windows:**

* Select the clip you want to modify, and then click on the "Effects" tab. From there, you can browse through the available effects and preview them before adding them to your project.
* Once you've found an effect you like, simply drag and drop it onto the clip.
* You can also add multiple effects to a single clip if you want.
* Just remember that too many effects can make your video look cluttered and difficult to watch. So be sure to use them sparingly.

When you're happy with your added effects, click on the "Ok" button to save your changes.

##### Step4 Edit Audio & Titles

A time-lapse video is to create photos at regular intervals and assemble them into the video to record changes that would be slow for the human eye to see. Time-Lapse video shows the technique of slow-motion videos using the same principle.

Time-lapse is usually for several purposes but mostly it is utilized to show the passage of time in a fast-forward format. time-lapse means that the camera takes the picture and then combined them into one video that seems to something happen in quickly. The lapse is set into video form in post-production, so movie mode is not necessary. Once the lapse is finished, it's time to take it into post-production to bring it to life.

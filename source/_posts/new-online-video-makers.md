Step1 Firstly, open Filmora on your computer. If you haven't already downloaded it you can get it at filmora.wondershare.com. Once you open Filmora, click "File" and "Record screen." Here you can adjust various options like recording your computer's audio or including your webcam.

![begin recording your tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-3.jpg)

## Part 2\. Keep your intro short

Avoid adding any long intro monologues or skits to your tutorial. First, your goal is to be informative and entertaining. Second, it's always best to lead with a peek at what the final result of your tutorial will look like whether it's a video effect arts and crafts or a recipe video.

![keep your intro short](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-4.jpg)

## Part 3\. Break down your tutorial into steps

No matter what your tutorial is about, breaking down your process into steps makes your tutorial a lot easier to understand with Filmora. You can do this in just a few minutes.

Step1 Move the playhead to where you want your first section to begin. Next, click the "Tittles" and pick a style that appeals to you.

![click the tittles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-5.gif)

Step2 Click and drag your title on a track above your footage.

![click and drag your title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-6.jpg)

Step3 Double-click your new title and type in your section title. You can even adjust the style of the text to your liking. Repeat the process for as many steps as you'd like for your tutorial

![type in your section title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-7.jpg)

## Part 4\. Narrate your video

Narration is a crucial part of making an effective tutorial video. Indeed, with Filmora adding narration to your video couldn't be easier.

Step1 Moving your playhead to the beginning of your video. Then go to file record media and record voiceover and select your microphone. The drop-down menu and click the red button, then simply narrate your video as it plays out. Your voice will automatically be recorded and placed into the project. Additionally, make sure to speak, reduce background noise, and use simple language

![go to file record media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-8.gif)

Step2 Once you're done recording, you can adjust the volume and further edit the voiceover by double-clicking the new audio file on your timeline.

![adjust the volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-9.jpg)

## Part 5\. Emphasize important steps

Since you are working in a visual medium, emphasizing critical steps visually is very important. Here are some of the easiest and most effective ways to do that in Filmora

Step1 firstly, the freeze frame. Move your playhead to the frame you want to freeze, select your clip, go to tools speed, and click add freeze frame.

![click add freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-10.gif)

Step2 To adjust the length of your freeze, click "freeze frame." and enter any duration you want.

![click freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-11.gif)

Step3 Next is about to zoom the video. Double-click your clip and click on "Animation" and then "customize."

![zoom the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-12.jpg)

Step4 Move your playhead to where you want the zoom to begin and click "Add" to add a keyframe. Then move your playhead where you want your zoom to finish and click "Add" again.

![click add to add a keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-13.jpg)

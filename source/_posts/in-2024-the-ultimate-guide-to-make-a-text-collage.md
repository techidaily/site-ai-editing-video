## Part 2\. How to add mosaic to video with Filmora

Whether you want to hide a passerby's face or your own, or even other types of objects, Wondershare Filmora is ready to take on the task. While its nifty face-off function automatically follows the movement of a marked face, the mosaic effect is the fast and perfect solution for a static object in the video.

Step1 After importing a video to Filmora, tap on the Effects tab and find the Mosaic filter from the gallery.

Step3 A yellow box will appear in the viewer. You can drag and adjust its size to hide the targetted object. You can also adjust the opacity and intensity of the effect using the adjustment menu, accessible when you double-click the yellow box.

Step4 Double-click on the clip and visit the effects menu at the top of the screen.

![opening effects menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-13.jpg)

Step5 Click on the ‘first color’ and select the eye dropper tool. This will allow us to select the red flower in the preview window. You can also click different parts of the image to get the color that we want.

![select the first color and eye dropper tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-14.jpg)

Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.

![clicking on the second color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-15.jpg)

Step7 Pick the eyedropper tool and click it on the green part of the clip. Then adjust the range slider as needed.

![adjusting range slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-16.jpg)

Alright, let’s watch back the video to see how both colors are now isolated.

![flower color isolated](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-17.jpg)

Follow all the steps in the correct order. This is how you can use NewBlue effects for color isolation using Wondershare Filmora. The color isolation using the selective color effect defines the point of interest in the clip for the viewers.

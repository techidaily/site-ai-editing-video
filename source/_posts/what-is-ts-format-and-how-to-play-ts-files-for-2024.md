## Part 2\. Pros and Coins about TS Video Format

Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!

### Advantages of TS File Format

A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.

Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent.

For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.

Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.

TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.

### MP4

MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the '.ts' extension.

### 3\. Mp3Care

![mp3care](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-4.jpg)

This web application makes converting JPEG files to MP4 video files a simple two-step process that only requires uploading photos and then selecting the time between the two images. The maximum number of photos you can use in a video is limited to just twenty, with the maximum duration of each image in the video not exceeding the 20-second mark. Adding transitions between images is also on the list of options this platform provides, but Mp3 Care Photo to Video lacks any other video editing features. Despite some obvious drawbacks, this online photo-to-video maker is still a great choice if you want to convert your photos to videos quickly and for free.

## Part 2: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on a Computer

Time-lapse video is a type of video that allows you to see a huge amount of change in a very short time. You can see it on all social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. It can be used to make all kinds of videos, from simple scenes of nature to complex events. The first time-lapse video was made in France in 1872 by Léon Bouly.

There are a lot of steps to make a time-lapse video on a computer.

Step1 You need to download the free software that comes with the camera. You can find it on the manufacturer's website or through a search engine.

Step2 You'll want to plug in your phone's charging cable and plug it in so that it can stay charged while filming.

Step3 You'll need to find somewhere quiet where you can set up your camera and tripod. If possible, try to do this outside so that there's no worry about getting dust or dirt on your lens.

Step4 Set up your phone so that it will record once every hour for an hour straight. This will give you enough time for each frame of video before switching over to the next one after an hour has passed.

Step5 Start recording!

**Why we should make a time-lapse video on a computer?**

Time lapses are also useful for showing how something changes over time. For example, if you want to show how an environment changes from day to night, or how a plant grows from seedlings into mature plants after being watered and nourished by sunlight, these videos would be perfect for demonstrating this change in real-time.

You can also create time-lapse videos that show the growth of plants or flowers over time. You could use this method to demonstrate how plants grow from seedlings into fully grown trees or bushes. You could even try creating a time-lapse video showing the growth of a weed from the seedling stage into full bloom with its seeds spread out across the ground below it!

You can make your videos more fun and engaging. By recording multiple angles at the same time, you can capture all the exciting moments, like when something unexpected happens. Or when something amazing turns out to be a total disaster in real life. You can easily share with friends and family members who might not be able to come to see you in person.

## Part 2\. How to use LUTs in VN editor?

First, we must know that it is compatible with which platforms. So, it is now available for Android, iOS, and Mac OS only. However, you can also use it on Windows with some Android or iOS emulators, but it is not a very continent way in our suggestions. Even after doing this, it does not work well on your Windows. Maybe you will face some glitches or malfunctioning problems. So it is better to use it on only those platforms for which it is primarily available. Please read the instructions below since we will go through how to use LUTs in it later on.

**On Mac:**

First of all, we will learn how you can do it on Mac:

1. Download the VN Editor for Mac and open it.
2. Add your video and then tap the filters option.

![tap the filters option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-2.jpg)

1. Now choose custom filters and then select the LUTs pack.

![select the luts pack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-3.jpg)

1. Select the desired LUT and apply.

![select the desired lut and apply](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-4.jpg)

**On Mobile:**

Secondly, we will discuss how we can do this on our mobiles (Android or iOS). The procedure on both devices (Android or iOS) is almost comparable. Therefore, we will discuss the steps from the perspective of both of these here:

1. First, download the VN editor from your mobile app store (Android or iOS) and the LUTs pack you want to use in your video.

![download the vn editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-5.jpg)

1. After downloading them on your mobile, open the VN editor application.
2. Create a new project and add your video to it.

![create a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-6.jpg)

1. Then click on the **Filters** option and select add external or custom filters option next to the existing filters.

![click on the filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-7.jpg)

1. It will take you to the File manager of your mobile, from which you have to find the folder in which you have stored your LUTs.

![file manager](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-8.jpg)

1. After finding them, you can select those LUTs you want to use in your video and then click on the done or select button.

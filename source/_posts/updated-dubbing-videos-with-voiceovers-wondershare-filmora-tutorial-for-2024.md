## Dubbing Videos With Voiceovers | Wondershare Filmora Tutorial

Voiceovers have been a great utility in the digital ecosystem for a while. From movies to videos, the use of voiceovers has provided content creators with new dynamics. While it has enhanced the quality of video creation, there are other technicalities that have arisen against it. In this article, we will be discussing the details involving voiceovers and recordings.

Also, it includes a discussion of tools that can be used to ensure professional voice recordings. Go through the provided details to know how to utilize voiceovers to perfection.

## Part 1: What is The Difference Between Voice Recording and Voiceover?

Do you know **voiceover** and voice recording are two different terms? They are often used correspondingly but have different meanings. Here are a few differences between the two in the section below:

**Voice Recording**

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations. Ultimately, we can say that voiceover is a part of voice recording that should be synchronized with the visual media to fulfill its purpose.

## Beginners Guide to Green Screen Keying

Did they have dinner on Mars? Photographers are becoming more daring with their creations thanks to the advancement in editing software. For example, after effects green screen keying allows you to alter your image's background during post-production.

![green screen key](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-1.jpg)

The following is all you need to know about the green screen key effect and how to apply it using different video editing software. In addition, you will discover why the effect is popular with video editors. Keep reading to find out more.

## Part1: What is keying in green screen?

Keying refers to a post-production process of separating and isolating an image's aspects using color or brightness. Typically, filmmakers use it to remove green screens and make color corrections to add warmth to the subjects' skin tones.

It involves identifying a color or brightness value that you will make transparent in the photo. In addition, you can use two types of keys during the keying process.

### Chroma Keys

These allow you to select a specific color in your image and make everything that features the color transparent. Typically, chrome keys are best for images and videos featuring lots of green or blue backgrounds.

### Luma Keys

Alternatively, you can use luma keys to determine which backgrounds will be transparent according to the brightness level. In addition, you can use them to designate the backgrounds you want opaque in your final image.

So, why do filmmakers prefer using a green screen? First, green is not a natural color in human skin tones. As such, it allows you more creative freedom with your shots. In addition, most digital cameras feature more green photosites allowing you to capture more details in your shots and making it the default choice for filmmakers.

However, you can also use a blue screen for your shots if green is your subject's main color scheme. This is because blue is also rare among human subjects and allows you greater flexibility than any other background alternative.

Using a green screen key is an important skill to learn as a filmmaker. This is because it allows you more creative freedom resulting in more iconic images and photos. Although most video editing software allows you to apply the effect easily, it still requires finesse.

For example, using after effects green screen keying incorrectly can result in spill issues. This is when the green light from your screen bounces back to your subject. As such, you lose some subject detail, and the image appears messy.

Furthermore, not all video editing software includes the green screen key tool. Therefore, always check your software details before purchasing a copy. The next section contains step-by-step guides on performing green screen keying on some of the industry's most popular software.

## Part2: How to do Green Screen Keying in After Effects?

Adobe After Effects green screen keying tool is arguably one of the top favorites for filmmakers. It features a user-friendly interface, and several keying presets you can use to achieve incredible photo finishes. For example, the Keylight effect is an Academy Award-winning preset you can use to apply professional-quality color keying.

Follow these steps to do green screen keying using Adobe After Effects.

### 1\. Upload your footage to Adobe After Effects

![upload footage to adobe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-2.jpg)

Launch the program from your macOS or Windows device, and click on the **New Composition From Footage** option. A pop-up window with your file locations will appear and click on the footage you want to import. Ensure the footage you use is shot using a green screen background to achieve the best results.

### 2\. Using the green screen key presets

![using the green screen key presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-3.jpg)

Once the footage is imported, click on the **Window** menu option on your workspace, and click on **Effects & Presets** from the sub-menu. Once the panel opens, tap **Animation Presets** and highlight the **Keylight + Key Cleaner + Advanced Spill Suppressor** preset from the **Image-Utilities** menu.

### 3\. Drag and drop the preset to your footage

Then drag and drop the effect to your uploaded footage to begin the keying process. The green screen key preset applies three effects to your image:

* **Keylight effect.**

The effect allows you to select the background color you want to make transparent. First, select the green screen background by clicking on **Screen Color** and selecting **Color Picker**. Then apply the effect by clicking on the green background closest to your subject.

* **Key cleaner effect.**

The key cleaner effect sharpens your subject's edges for a more detailed finish. In addition, you will rarely adjust its values because it automatically corresponds to the changes you make using the Keylight effect. However, you can adjust the **Additional Edge Radius** and **Reduce Chatter** options to decrease the visible noise of your image. Furthermore, you can use the **Alpha Contrast** adjustment to increase the sharpness of your subject's edges.

* **Advanced spill suppressor.**

Sometimes your green screen background can spill to your subject's edges resulting in a messy outline. For example, you may find a green outline on your subject's hair or clothing. The **Advanced Spill Suppressor** eliminates these outlines automatically. You can enable the effect by clicking the check box next to the effect from the **Animation Presets** panel.

### 4\. Apply a new background

Once you apply the green screen key effect, you can add any custom background to your footage. You need to **Import** the file to your After Effects library and then drag & drop it into your footage's timeline.

Remember, you must have an active Adobe After Effects license to access the green screen keying feature. In addition, you get access to Adobe Creative Cloud, which offers access to creative asset libraries such as Behance and Adobe Fonts. Alternatively, you can check out the free 7-day trial available to all new users.

## Part3: How to do Green Screen Keying in Filmora? \[Free& Easy\]

Filmora is another popular video editing software that features a green screen editor as part of its effects. The tool, officially known as Chroma Key, allows you to swap your image backgrounds using different colors or images from your internal library.

In addition, the tool is available as a free trial for Windows and macOS devices. However, you will only find it on Filmora version 9 and above. Here is a step-by-step guide on green screen keying using Chroma Key on Filmora.

### 1\. Upload your footage to [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

![upload your footage to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-4.jpg)

Launch the program on your device and click on the **New Project** option. A window will open where you can **Import** your green screen footage and the desired background. Once done, you will **Drag and Drop** the clips to your project's first and second tracks in the timeline.

### 2\. Adjust your green screen settings

![adjust your green screen settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-5.jpg)

Then, double-click your green screen footage to open the **Edit Panel**. Select the Video Tab and check the **Chroma Key** box to enable the effect. Once done, you can use the following tools to edit your footage:

* **Alpha Channel**

The tool allows you to edit the footage's borders, transparency, and shadows by displaying your image in black and white. The areas you have successfully keyed out will be in black and the rest in white or grey, depending on the severity.

* **Offset**

The offset tool allows you to change the visibility of your background.

* **Edge Feathering.**

You use this tool to soften your subject's edges during green screen keying.

* **Edge Thickness.**

The edge thickness tool helps you increase the sharpness of your subject's edges. As such, they appear more detailed resulting in a clear and well-balanced photo.

### 3\. Merge the new background

Once you complete the green screen keying, merging the new background is next. You do this by seamlessly positioning the background to fit your green screen footage. Then, the Filmora Chroma key tool will merge the images or footage and make it appear as one clip.

### 4\. Export your content

Finally, you can export your content in multiple formats to suit your desired platform. For example, you can export the file in either MP4, WMV, or MOV to share on most social media platforms.

Please note that you need an active Filmora subscription to use Chroma Key. In addition, you can subscribe to individual and business plans depending on your requirements. However, any creations using the Filmora Individual plan require you to mention the software in their description.

## Part4: FAQs

### 1\. Is there a difference between chroma keying and green screening?

No. There is no difference between chroma keying and green screening. Both processes involve you replacing a specific color in your image and replacing it with a new background. In addition, some filmmakers use the terms synonymously because green is the best color to use when chroma keying. However, you can also use other colors for your chroma keying, with blue being the next best alternative.

### 2\. Can you create a green screen video without using a green screen background?

Launch Filmora and add the video clip that contains the track you want to modify for your project.

##### Step2Find the Silence Detection Feature

![find the silence detection feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step2.jpg)

Remember, you will notice the Silence Detection feature in only audio-enabled video clips. Follow the below steps to detect and remove silent gaps from the clip.

* After selecting the audio or video clip, go to Tools, followed by Audio. You will find the Silence Detection option. The Silence Detection window will appear once you touch this option.

##### Step3Modify the Settings for the Silence Detection Feature

![silence detection settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step3.JPG)

You may change the threshold or sensitivity to make it work for you. The sensitivity level determines the size of the pause. Thus, a lower sensitivity level records longer pauses. You can fine-tune three crucial Filmora Silence Detection settings in this step.

First, you should adjust the volume threshold to fix a specific value for silence. This parameter tells the algorithm how loud you want it to be before it becomes annoying. By default, 25% is the volume threshold. It implies that the software will consider segments silent if their volume threshold value is less than 25%.

 Now, you should adjust the Minimum Duration option. It tells Filmora how long a period of quiet or low-volume sound should be. Just 0.5 seconds is the default minimum duration. In other words, for 0.5 seconds to be considered quiet, there must be no sound.

 You can also set the Softening Buffer value. This setting allows you to add a little delay before and after audible parts begin and finish. With 0.1s set as the default, the softening buffer starts to work. It implies that the beginning and end of the audible parts may each have their own 0.1-second buffering time.

##### Step4Eliminate Any Found Silences

![choose analyze option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step4.jpg)

Hit the "Analyze" button after you're happy with the settings. The Filmora will detect and remove the silent areas in your audio track.

The software also highlights segments in two different colors. Seen in black are the portions that do not contain any sound. The highlighted sections indicate the audible portions.

##### Step5Evaluate Your Work and Adjust

![evaluate your work and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step5.JPG)

You can make sure the video segments move without a hitch. Thus, listen to the modified audio track again. You can adjust the clips in the timeline to customize the edit directly if necessary.

Of course, you also have the option to tweak the three audio settings listed in step 3\. Next, choose Restart to remove the silent segments from your video.

##### Step6Export Your Video Clip

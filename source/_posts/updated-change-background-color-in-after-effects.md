## How To Make a Video Podcast

Starting a video podcast can be quite intimidating, but the truth is; having the proper knowledge will help you do things more correctly.

As we all know, knowledge is the key to success. So, for you to navigate your way around the video podcasting industry easily, you need to consume enough information that will enable you to make fewer wrong decisions.

To help you out, we took our time to do more research on how to record video podcasts, and in this post, we will share all you need to know to record a video podcast that stands out.

## Part 1\. But first: why record with a video?

If you've done a little research, you'll notice many podcasters switched to recording with videos instead of audio. Did they decide to start doing that so we could see their faces? Well, the answer is NO. But before we discuss more on that, you should know what a video podcast is and its types.

You guessed right. A video podcast is a podcast with video. The video element could be a static image or a video recording of the podcast host and the guest. A video podcast will help you do the following;

**1\. Enhance the visual content**

Research shows that humans learn more from what they visualize than what is heard. Yes, this is because 30% of the human brain comprises neurons dedicated to visual processing, and just 3% is dedicated to hearing. Besides, videos are always more engaging compared to audio. So why not combine both to boost your podcast performance?

**2\. Level up the personality and relatability**

Most people have more belief in what they see than what is heard. So, video podcasts allow audiences to easily see your expression and understand your passion for the subject you discuss. It also builds a deeper level of connections between you and them. Also, it helps to add to the originality of your podcast and your brand as a whole.

**3\. Make the content more accessible**

Your podcast show becomes more accessible when it's in the video. You won't be limited to just uploading it on podcast platforms but also on social media as a short TikTok trailer, Instagram post, YouTube video, etc. Doing this will get your content in front of a wide range of audience, thus prompting more people to engage with your podcast.

## Part 2\. Get your gear set up

The first step to starting a video podcast is getting your gear set up. We recommend you start with the following podcast equipment:

* A camera (if recording a video podcast)
* Microphone(s)

### 1\. Depth & lighting

To make a professional-looking video podcast, you need to add as much depth as possible. So yes, there should be enough distance between you and the background (don't be too close or too far). However, if this is impossible because you have a small space, good lighting should spice things up. Godox SL -150 is one perfect choice that you can opt for.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

### 3\. Declutter

It's never a good idea to leave unnecessary items in the background because that makes it look messy. Also, it may compromise everything you've done to spice it up. So, after you finish putting up an exciting background, take a few minutes to inspect the lighting, the elements, and lots more. Then, ensure it's clean and tidy.

## Part 4\. Create a collaborative doc

Creating a collaborative doc is also essential for making a podcast. You might ask: "what is a collaborative doc?" Well, it's where you jot down information on the following;

* **Niche or Topic**
* **Brand name**
* **Format for the Show and each of the Episodes**
* **Intro and Outro Music**
* **Create a Cover Art**
* **Ideas to record the first podcast**

## Part 5\. Create your show

Now that you have a perfect plan and setup, the next thing is to start the show. But first, what format have you chosen for your first show? Is it the static image recording? The remote interview recording? The in-studio recording? or interview & b-roll recording? Not sure of which format to start with? Worry less. We'll walk you through the steps of the process for each process. Just keep reading;

### Method 1: Static Image Podcast Recording

![static image podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-8.jpg)

It is the simplest way to record a video podcast. You don't necessarily have to show your face. Instead, record an audio podcast, then convert its file into a video file and add a static image to the background to keep playing as the viewer is listening.

You need video editing software to create this kind of video podcast - Filmora is a perfect choice. However, keep in mind that this kind of video podcast is usually less engaging, only that you'll be able to publish it on various video platforms.

**Equipment Required:**

* Video editor - Filmora
* Computer

### Method 2: In-studio Podcast Recording

![in-studio podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-9.jpg)

Unlike static image recording, this kind of video podcast requires you to show in the video. It involves capturing the conversation between you and a guest or your colleague from a perfectly set up studio.

**Equipment required:**

* Camera
* Microphone
* Tripod (if you have nobody to stay behind the camera)
* Computer
* Headphones
* Video editing software - Filmora

### Method 3: Remote Interview Podcast Recording

![remote interview podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-10.jpg)

It is just like a live-stream podcast. It involves recording multiple speakers who are not in the same room as you. This kind of video podcast is reliable when you intend to shoot online interviews with guests across the country.

**Equipment Required:**

* Software that supports capturing multiple webcams. An example is Riverside.
* Microphone
* Computer
* Video Editor - Filmora

## Part 6\. Edit your video podcast

After creating your show, the next thing is to edit your video podcast to make it look worthy when you publish it on any platform. But for this operation, you need powerful video editing software like Filmora.

Filmora is an efficient video editor with many excellent features, including audio recording, audio effects, speech-to-text, and many more. Also, it allows users with any level of experience to create nice-looking videos using these features. With Filmora, you can;

## Part 8\. Share and promote your video podcast

Most people think the final phase of making a video podcast is uploading to a video platform, but you still have to share and promote your content on different platforms. Nevertheless, it will help get the podcast to a wide range of audiences.

Thankfully, a video podcast allows you to upload a short clip of your show to different social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc. With this, your show will become more accessible across various platforms, thus increasing your show's engagement. Honestly, it's a win-win!

## The Bottom Line

There you have it! Just like that, you're ready to be a part of the top-rated video podcasters you can ever think of. With all that's discussed in the article, we believe you can now focus on creating valuable and engaging content for your audience.

However, as you start to record video podcasts, we advise you to invest in the right marketing tools to help you gain more attraction in the industry.

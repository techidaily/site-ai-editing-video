## Take Your Video Editing to the Next Level with Video Scopes

All video editors have been there. You edit and color-correct your video project only to find out that the final product is not what you expected. The contract and colors dramatically shift when viewed on a different device. In most cases, this is caused by improperly calibrated monitors, but it could also be your eyes playing tricks on you. **Video scopes** help in preventing this problem ensuring that the color in your video is consistent across devices. With video editing scope, you get the exact representation of the elements that make up your image, including lightness and color values. In this article, we explain what video scopes are and how you can use them in your editing projects.

**Color Correction Editor** An easy-to-use video editor helps you make color correction and color grading experience for videos!

## **Part 1\. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them**

When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.

![video scopes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-1.JPG)

Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:

* **Increased Accuracy**: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments
* **Reliability**: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.
* **Professional Editing**: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.
* **Matching Color Between Shots**: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.

Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.

## **Part 2\. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones**

Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:

* [Waveform Scopes](#scope1)
* [Histogram](#scope2)
* [RGB Parade](#scope3)
* [Vector Scopes](#scope4)

### **1\. Waveform Scopes**

Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-2.JPG)

### **2\. Histogram**

The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0\. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-3.JPG)

### **3\. RGB Parade**

This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.

![rgb parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-4.JPG)

### **4\. Vector Scopes**

This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.

01 [Why Discord Is Becoming Popular Recently?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Discord Emojis?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create Discord Emoji GIF](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Why Discord Is Becoming Popular Recently?

Discord has become a viral chatting platform for gamers as many people use it to keep in touch with their family and friends. It made what was initially created for gamers to become something much more. It gives people a communication platform when social interaction through online mediums was not so popular.

First founded in 2015, Discord came intending to be a gamer's platform to chat and build one another communities. More so, it has become a platform that is more than that and encompasses audiences or communities of different interests and not only gamers.

Discord is now a platform for messaging and allows users to communicate using different channels. This platform can be a less formal version of Slack. Users can write text and send video and voice messages and other forms of rich media such as photos and videos through the platform.

There are a lot of exceptional Discord servers that function as a place to speak about a lot of different things and interact using **Gif discord emoji.** This is like Reddit, where communities get built via forums that create a network experience through shared interests or hobbies. Due to this, it has become easy to discover a niche on Discord as there are a lot of distinct servers that accommodate an extensive range of interests.

Each server is composed of multiple channels, and every channel has its subjects, individual rule set, and interests. Thus, every channel can be valuable to talk about different things:

● You can talk about gaming

● The other can be useful to talk about sports activities, etc.

The possibilities are endless, and the most crucial part is that it is free to create these servers.

The most effective way to discover servers is by simply Googling them because the search feature on the platform only shows the most popular ones.

Discord is a somewhat flexible platform as it works on both desktop and mobile applications. You will connect your YouTube and Spotify accounts to add to your experience.

On top of its versatility, Discord is also very customizable based on a person's interests and how someone desires to use the platform. Users can have servers that can be either private or public. There is also a position of an administrator, in which they can assign roles to each person, which comes with special privileges and name tags. These roles may benefit various large groups and provide a moderation sense in the server.

Not only does Discord offer group chats, but it also offers a non-public chatting feature which is also available. This allows users to talk one-on-one with other users and turn out to be friends with one another.

## Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?

**Gif emojis for Discord** is a medium available in Discord that allows you to share data, news, and all other types of content efficiently and quickly to your audience using emojis/Gifs. Hence, note that images and videos are the types of content people can attract on Discord. Some of the reasons for **Discord Emojis** includes:

![why use discord emoji ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/create-discord-emoji-3.jpg)

**●** **Help you get good engagement on your Discord chats:** This is the most important thing to consider in brand growth. The prime goal for every brand is to attract the audience and hold their attention. All you need is to chat content that helps you gain your potential customer's interest, and sometimes a plain boring text is not enough to do that. Therefore, utilizing emojis in your Discord chats is very beneficial in getting your audience's attention. Emojis can convey ideas, emotions, and feelings more accurately, and they are also effortless on the eyes. They can also be helpful to add the much-needed buzz that cannot be through word or text.

**●** **Helps to save time and effort:** These days, communication tends to be more at a breakneck pace and rapid. The most audience will most likely favor shorter Discord content over longer ones. Many people get tired of your chats o Discord drag on because if your Discord content takes so much effort and time to read or view, your audience might become bored and leave a negative review on your brand. Using emojis on your Discord chats is beneficial because, depending on the type of emoji, you can convey a lot of sense in a shorter time frame than when you are using written text. A perfect example is writing a chat about something very empowering. When you choose to correspond this type of content through text, it could take a little more effort and a bit of intricately used language to build up the reader and get the desired effect of empowering the reader. Emojis are very accurate in passing out the meaning and are shorter than words. That is the primary reason why all-in-all emojis can save effort and time to create your Discord chat.

**●** **It can represent a meaning or idea accurately**: Many emojis have a much better effect in a sense than text because a lot of abstract content can be easily understood using images than text.
